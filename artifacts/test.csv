2,Who Stole Roger Rabbit's Extras?,"Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Castaway), Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an eye-popping delight for kids and adults alike with it's clever comedy, inventive animation and seamless cartoon interactions with the actors. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd are great, and the combination of cartoonish humour creates a nuance that woks well. Alan Silversti's lively score suits the film's tone, using the same themes as Back to the Future yet bringing new ""cartoony"" music to the film. The brilliant combination of effortlessly clever humour and high-sprited fun make this one a superb classic.This ""special edition"" DVD is very dissapointing in the way of extras though, with no features of any kind, not even a trailer! This could be forgiven if the sound and picture quality wasn't so shoddy! Thankfully, a re-release issue will be out later this year...."
2,End of the beginning,I've been a fan of Freebo's since the days he backed up Bonnie Raitt on fretless bass and blues tuba. I recently had the opportunity to see him playing with Maria Muldaur. I met him after the show and bought his CD based on hearing him perform one tune from it. This CD is a killer! I don't know how he's managed to hide his songwriting and singing abilities all these years but I'm sure glad he has finally come to the front and given us a much fuller picture of his talents. The span of musical genres on this album is breathtaking and his backup players are the best in the business. Everything from reggae to full-out rock. I hope he has more of this to share with us in a follow on album. This was worth the wait to hear him leading the way! Try it. You'll like it!
2,i love it,i gave this as a gift for my friend she love it. i like it so much that i am ordering another for me. looks beautiful well crafted.thank you so much.
1,Bad Computer...Nice Screen,"Bad Computer................BLUE SCREEN MANIA.""BREATHES HEAVY""...........OVERALL.BAD COMPUTER....DONT DO IT TO YOUR SELF."
1,Weird,"I dont even know what to say about this flim, all I can say is that it's very dumb and it really pissed be off cuz IM a huge Kurt Cobain fan......But it is kind of funny but yet so depressing... But yah if your the type of person who likes to watch movies that has no talking hardly n' luv watchin people just walk around then Hey you should really like this flim"
2,Got Me Running,"This tea product got me running alright, to the crapper. But it did help loose about 10 lbs, mostly compacted fecal matter. I also feel more energized and feeling alot better. Before taking this product my best friend was a couple of cups of black coffee but since taking this for the last month my craving for coffee and sweets has subsided, however i now have to bulk up on toilet paper. Great product great buy!"
2,Hinge Pins Are Great,These are great for fixing your door easy to install they don't come with directions however. I recommend you check on line in the Chevy Blazer forum there you will find detailed instructions for installation they even have tips on how to make a simple tool to heip with the inserting the bushings. I found the info very helpful and saved me a lot of time and grief.
2,He IS his Brother's keeper!!!,"Wonderful movie!! Beat Takeshi is a great director and has fantastic presence in any movie he stars! Fans of Pulp Fiction or True Romance should enjoy this movie. I won't go into the storyline, you can read that on the preview, but you won't be disappointed if you like action movies. This is one of the better ones!"
1,Stay away from this one,"The material on this CD is terrible, and Clay's uninspired singing just makes the whole endeavor worse. The songs here are as generic and bland as you can imagine, and they contain some of the worst lyrics in pop music history. ""If I were invisible, I would be the smartest man?"" Poor production values don't help. Even the most enthusiastic pop devotee is going to have a hard time respecting this slapped-together piece of commercialism.Clay Aiken also doesn't do himself any favors with his bland and routine delivery. Clay has a powerful voice, and if he had a little more imagination and a little more artistry, he might have elevated some of this material. Instead, he seems to be relaxing on cruise control as he resorts to predictable phrasing and timing with frustrating regularity. No soul, no subtlety, no artistry.Start to finish, this is an obvious rush effort on the parts of the producers, the songwriters, and Clay himself. At least I hope so."
1,Warmer,"Just to start off, warmer is just what this thing does. I like my coffee just a bit hotter. This is my second warmer and it is not any better than the first one. I bought my second warmer at Wal Mart for around $5.00. Target on line list at $9.99. The major reason I use Amozon for most of my purchases is I can find things quickly and don't have to go store to store trying to find something. As I get older it is harder to get out and shop. Most of the time I get good deals but to be careful, you can get ripped off too."
1,battery died after 1 month on this replacment headset,"Nice and samll but battery died on this replacment headset after 1 month, the first one died after 3 months. The replacment battery is more expensive then the headset inself but I ordered it anyway, the battery was non functioning and now I have 2 junk headsets and one junk battery!!!"
1,Why Cripsin? Why?,"This was one of the worst movies I've seen in recent memory. I'll start off by saying that all the sped up and slo-mo effects were unnecessary and honestly annoying. The kill scenes were cheaply done CGI which looked terrible for the most part. It's a spoiler, but in the last attack scene of the movie the 'dream girl' literally bursts through a tree and a burned body to attack Simon/Stanley. My biggest problem with this movie is that I know Cripin Glover can do so much better. I'm sure he did the best with the script he was given, which wasn't much, but I'd have passed on this role. After seeing him in Rivers Edge and Willard it was almost painful to watch him play this character. I'm just glad I got this used for six bucks and not the twenty-five amazon is asking for it"
2,not bad at all,I like using it. Only complaint is the straps to synch your bike are way too long and get in the way
2,Kept my interest,"""Nappily"" was entertaining!. However, the characters of Venus and Khandi worked my nerves. Both were shallow and had agendas. A lot of time was spent on Venus and her ""finding herself"" which is what we need to do from time to time, but so much time was devoted to this. We were privy to the main characters' thoughts which was an insight into each of them.The book's opening left you ""hanging"". I surprised by the ending. I give the writing a four (which is what reviews are about?). I was not bored!"
2,Hell Yea,He done it again. Grillz is one of his best songs. The album is worth the money. Way to go Nelly!!!!
1,Don't Buy This One!!!,"Sound like a broken record? It is very frustrating having to load EVERY single sheet of paper into the feeder; but believe me, you too will have the pleasure if you purchase this printer. No doubt it's a product defect. Do yourself a favor, save your sanity and frustration...buy a different one."
2,Better Than the Second.,"I am a BIG fan of the series and ordered the disk to the second season first, and was disapointed with it. All the heroic upbeat themes that I liked so much in the show just were not on the disk. Only a cut up jumble of them toward the end of the disk.THIS disk how ever is exactly what every BIG O fan should get.If you are a Collector get both, if you're just a fan, get this one."
2,I Recommend It,"This CD is a complete compilation of all the songs from TLOZ: OOT. For the most part I like it, but it has some drawbacks. See, when Ocarina of Time first came out, I bought the soundtrack off of Nintendo, which only had 29 songs. Obviously, it hardly contains every song from the game, but the ones on this track are so much longer. Example: in my CD, Track Number 25, Gerudo Valley, runs through the 'verses' twice and then concludes, whereas on this CD, it only runs through once. Acually, it does that for most of the tracks. Zora's Domain on this CD is only about a minute and a half, while mine is longer. I recommend this CD to anyone who is a devout Legend of Zelda fan. It has everything on it, I was thrilled (I especially liked the Temple tracks). They arranged it well, though I think one of the tracks is repeated somewhere. Anyway, I think it's worth the money. GO FOR IT!!!"
2,"""When you believe""","This song, sung by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey is GREAT! Sometimes, it leaves tears in my eyes. But, the song has some contrasts. Whitney Houston has one of the most beautiful voices in the universe. So when she sings the first verse and chorus, and then Mariah Carey starts to sing the second verse... it's a HUGE CONTRAST! Mariah screeches... If Celine Dion, who has the most wonderfully beautiful voice in the universe, had sung it with Whitney Houston, the song would've been irresistible. It would have been so unexplainable beautiful. Anyway, great job, Mariah and Whitney!"
2,Solid Value-Conscious Replacement Power Adaptor,"After going through 2 OEM Apple adaptors, and deciding that I can't justify my budget for power adaptors going through the roof, I decided to try this adaptor.After a month of use, I have to say I am well pleased. This is a great price for a simple product. (Really, how complicated can a power adaptor be?)PRO: It is solid white (although the picture makes it seem not to be) just most like apple products and it does the simple task of powering my PowerBook.CON: It does not have the LED lighting at the base like the OEM does, but this is only a small loss.This is a great value minded replacement. I really can't say you would have any different experience with a Apple adaptor for over twice as much..."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED FOR AGES 15 AND UP.,KIDS WILL LOVE IT. ADULTS WILL THINK IT'S KID'S STUFF. I CAN'T SAY I HATED IT. BUT IT'S DEFINITELY FOR THE NICKELODEON CROWD.
2,Best one,"Maybe I'm not sophisticated or something, but I like Batman Begins so much better than the more critically acclaimed ""The Dark Night."" Dark and exciting, but still fun. Fantastic movie."
1,more than bad,this is for sure the badest and most boring film i have ever seen (i swear).8 women in one room for more than 5 minutes is by far too much.and everybody has to sing a chanson.this is horrible !
2,Moving story and film,"I enjoyed this film. Although a tear jerker, I thought the acting was well done and the script was well written."
2,Of Mice and Men,"I liked the book, but it was kind of sad in a good way though because no matter what George knew that Lennie was going to die so he killed him in a less painfull way.Steinbeck created really good characthers because they were so believable that it could of most likely been a non-fiction story. It's a good novel for young adults because it talks about stuff that could happen in real life and little kids might not understand the story or the words in the story. The social issue that it relates to is probably racism."
1,Fairly enjoyable but of questionable origin,"I seriously question the validity of these stories as real Victorian writing. As another reviewer mentioned, there are no background and bibliographic references whatsoever. I would at least expect approximate dates and publishers of the original texts.My guess is that they were written by a man familiar with Victorian erotica, but some time after the era ended. One clue is that one story describes the woman as a ""lesbian,"" a word which didn't come into popular use until well after the Victorian era. Sexologists began using it in 1889, but it is really doubtful that a writer of common porn would be aware of the most recently published scientific writing.On the other hand, the stories are entertaining as some ridiculous little pieces of erotica."
1,I just couldn't finish this book!,"Okay, At school I got this book order and the first book that popped in my mind was some book ""Jim the Boy"" Based on it's discription I said, wow, I'm going to read that. 2 weeks later I start on it and the real I bogger is the Prolude. MAN! That was probably the best prolude I read. Then I started this book. I read it to the point (2 chapters) that I thought HEY! Some one pressed the stop button. Why in the heck is this book so slow, if it's even moving. I tried finishing it but I just couldn't. Jim the boy is not the type for me, and I'm just and avarage ... year old. Maybe it could be great to you, so don't let my opinion disapoint you. Hey, My little brother loves it. What I'm trying to say is I didn't like it, (geez, what a waste of money)"
1,completely disappointing,"I do enjoy historical war movies when they're done right. This clichÃ©-ridden story is pain to watch and I fell asleep several times during the second half. The movie is ridiculously predictable, although in a few scenes the writers still managed to surprise me - the private airlift flown by the main character in order to rescue French girlfriend with kids from advancing German troops, or taking out the villainous German ace pilot during the final dogfight with revolver (after machine gun jammed/broke) are few examples of the worst writing taste. To say something positive - most acting wasn't too bad in my opinion (I've seen much worse lately), but couldn't save the flawed project. I wouldn't object the lack of historical accuracy if the story was enjoyable - but it was not. I'm giving one star in order to offset the multitude of 4-5 stars ratings; otherwise I'd give two stars. Do yourself a favor, ignore this movie and watch Blue Max again instead."
2,Praetorians is a pretty much must!,"Although this game is great, I would give it a 4.5 stars if I could. First the good: Beautiful graphics (the scenery is almost like real), the campaign has a story (unlike some RTS games that have no campaign or story), skirmish mode is fun but sometimes too quick, great gameplay, and it runs nicely. The bad: The units are sometimes kind of dumb (they stand and do nothing sometimes when they are told to go somewhere), the unit graphics could have been a little more sharp, and there aren't many units (this is not really that bad but I would have liked more units; there are 9 different combat units for the Romans). Don't let the bad things sway you from buying the game. Unless you are a real critic than the bad things would make you very mad."
2,An underated masterpiece,"Personally i feel this album has not got its just deserves. I am a huge Oasis fan and although not quite as good as Whats the Story morning glory, it certianly comesa close. Nearly all the tracks are superb with stand by me, i hope i think i know, dont go away and all around the world taking the front line. This album is great to listen to and was unfailry snubbed by all those set-in-their-way alternative music fans who think its cool to hate Oasis. A legend of an album by a legend of a band. Peace out."
1,Looks like it was Printed on a cheap broken down Printer,Ok.. I Love the story.. it is a beautiful romance .. I read it on-line and I wanted my own copy for that cold rainy night get-away. when It arrived I couldn't wait to open it. just to touch the words.. and then Put it in my bookshelf for a perfect night.... WHAT A SHOCK when I opened it to see the POOR PRINTING JOB ... on some of the pages even the lines are askew. black blotches around the words in some cases. and choppy letters not even fully formed on others... WHAT A VAST DISSAPOINTMENT. SHAME ON AMAZON!
1,not so much a review of the CD,"k, I love Clay... he ROCKED on AI2.My only problem is the song ""Invisible""- lyrics: If I were invisible, i would watch you in your room"". STALKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE!!! Does anyone else find this song as deeply disturbing as I do? He's got a GREAT voice tho! He just needs to think about the songs he's singing before recording them... I mean seriously..."
2,Major Step Forward,"Let me start off by saying that I didn't care for the last album.This one however is light years ahead of the debut. Sonically it is phenominal, they got great sounds this time out.The songs are heavier and less quirky than the debut. There are some awesome heavy riffs with great grooves, however there are still some of the annoying (IMO) vocal interludes. Basically I tolerate these to get to the cool parts, fortunately those ""coolparts"" pay off big. Just saw them for ""Pledge Of Allegiance""and they were outstanding live."
1,Horrible!,"I have never yet received my order, and it has been a month since I placed the order and paid for it. Will I be getting a refund of my money?"
1,oh my goodness!,"If this is a single release, that must mean the full album on CD would run about $700. The dollar must have dropped through the floor."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!,"This thing doesn't work at all - right out of the box! Says to set to low temp for several minutes to begin; 10 min later, not even warm.Description should indicate only way to get steam - for a second or two - is to mash the flimsy button on top, but then wait minute or two to get more. NO constant steam.Water reservoir would not detach to fill.Piece of cheap, worthless junk!"
1,I do NOT like pampers AT ALL,"I use these for my son, at night since he is potty trained during the day! He has woken up wet, WAY too many times, which means he is wet AND his bed! This has NEVER happened with Luvs...they are SOO much better of a diaper and cheaper too! All pamper has going for them is their name!"
2,Under the Tuscan Sun,"If you like romantic movies, this is the perfect one for you. But, please don't cry! It was a gift for someone else, eventhough I personally had seen it. It arrived just in time and I could keep track (via UPS) where it was, since I purchased it being in Puerto Rico."
1,"look, have any of you actually written a paper on this book?","well I have, and this book has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever tried to write about. It is basically about nothing, and I had to write about that for a school paper! you would hate it too if you had to write about it for a flippin' school paper! Really, need I say more? I bet the people who loved it never had to write an essay about Amaranta's repeated refusal of love, and in about a week! Just ask everyone who's a junior at my school! It is a torture manual! Far too beastly a book to be dealt with, even for most english majors and teachers!I give it two stars because it has more substance than the stuff Allende and Amado put out."
2,Condor Joe Rules!,"Condor Joe is the most human and endearing character of the show. He reminds me of Clint Eastwood in ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". Just one tough son of a bitch."
2,Tugs at Your Heart Strings,"""An excellent memoir and true crime saga. It made me think about some issues, such as the death penalty and victims' rights. It took me about 50 pages or so to really get into it, then I couldn't put it down."""
2,Spellbinding fantasy,"The premise of cloning from a living celebrity kept my interest all the way through. The author's love of baseball and it's heros is evident. I couldn't put it down, had to rush to the very satisfying finish. Looking forward to more from Polidoro."
2,Very imaginative and mysterious,"Did you ever wonder what may have happened to Tiny Tim, the Cratchett family, or old Mr. Scrooge? Bayard answers that question in a very imaginative and mysterious way. Part historical fiction, part mystery, and part psychological thriller, this book is a wonderful read."
2,1984,"Love the book, very appropriate for the time we live in. It arrived in the condition described."
2,Gripping,I could not put this book down. Fascinating depiction of human beings struggle for survival. If you enjoyed Into Thin Air you will also enjoy this one.
2,Soccer Drills Thouroughly Organized! Quality Explanations As Well!,These four programs were part of the 6 set I bought.All have valuable soccer tips that will give coaches achance to make practices exciting.
2,I have never heard a bad Webb Wilder release,"This CD, being his first release, finds him experimenting a little trying to find his signature sound, which, for a long time Webb fan, is a welcome suprise. The CD is 100% Webb, but there are hints of other things here as well, and there is even a noticable Elvis influence in some places. It is in no way an attempt to copy Elvis, though. It is very subtile. Like they were influenced by the same music growing up. That's what I heard, at least.This remastered compilation also sounds great. Some of the best sounding recordings I have heard in a long time. The drums are noticably clear and great sounding.This CD completes my collection. I now own the complete works of Webb Wilder. This CD does not disappoint. It is excellent, and I have never heard a bad Webb Wilder CD. I think that I enjoy it more because it was the last one that I bought, and I can really appreciate the variation on this CD more than if I would have bought it first.He is also great live."
2,It'll get in your head ...,"I saw the video for Galang on BPM and was laughing out loud. This skinny little Sri Lankan girl was spitting out london ghetto rap while dancing crazily in front of a cartoon backdrop. But the next few days, something about the beat stayed in my head. I had to hear it again. I did, and I taped it, and the more I listened to it the more I realized I wanted to hear more. I found it at a store and bought it. On the bus ride home I didn't much care for it, but like the Galang video, it stayed in my head. Everytime I listened to it I liked it a little bit more. It's like watching Pulp Fiction, each time you see it, something appears to you that you missed before that makes the whole thing make more and more sense. By now, it is one of my favourite CD's and I don't even listen to this genre (if it even fits into any genre) regularly. It isn't for everyone, but if you have a good subwoofer and an open mind for something unique...give it a shot."
1,from a reader,"I was delighted to get a copy at last.It started of fairly well,getting realy hard to read toward the end.Being such a long time hunter in the African bush I wondered why he could not fill the book with his exciting experiences.Which I am hoping he must have plenty. One thing I must mention here I am sure John Taylor is a proffessional butthroughout this book I am greatly disturbed abouth his continiues comments good and bad about the other great elephant hunters.I personaly think that,it takes a lot away from this book and its reading pleasure."
2,"QUIRKY, ENERGETIC, BLAZING PULSE-POUNDER","To the beat of an incessant techno/deephouse soundtrack, Lola runs, and then runs some more. I couldn't possibly think of another movie with such sheer cinematic buzz, it's cut like an MTV video: blink and you may miss a visual gag.The theme is doozy but interesting -- a slicing of the same reality in time into three perspectives. Blending an innovative mix of animation, still photography, slow motion, and normal cinematography, it illustrates how the smallest change in what a person does can alter the rest of their life, not to mention the lives of others, including complete strangers they pass on the street.Ironic, creative, and simply riveting -- a fabulous kinetic pleasure of a rental. The breathless high-octane soundtrack should be in your dance collections too."
1,"Don't fall for the ""junk science"" scam","Steve Milloy, author of this book, is a Washington, DC, lobbyist who has represented just about every polluting industry imaginable, especially the tobacco industry. If you doubt this, read the book Trust Us, We're Experts! by Rampton and Stauber, who have pages on Milloy, CATO, American Council on Science and Health, and their PR campaigns to smear health and environmental concerns as 'junk science' waged by evil public interest groups and activists like Ralph Nader. Pure industry propaganda."
2,Uplifting and thrilling to listen to,"I like this CD more all the time. The best song is ""Measure of a Man"", so touching and beautiful. I also like ""The Way"", and eagerly await the video of this. Clay's voice is beautiful throughout the album, and he shows facets of his personality that I never knew were there. I appreciate the fact that 3very song is a new song, and that there are no ""covers"" like in Ruben's debut (which I hated!)"
1,It's the end of haiku as we know it...,"This is what has become of haiku in English- and it is all bad. Haiku in America in general is vastly misunderstood and each of the verses in this volume show it. Some have three lines, some do not, some have kigo, some do not. By the looks of this, one can deduce that these ""poets"" gleamed their knowledge of haiku from Kerouac (another haiku fraud) rather than Basho. This is just an experiment really, conducted by a circle of friends who jotted down their thoughts and sent them to one another. Please, please avoid this title if you really care about or want to learn about haiku. Amazon should allow ""0"" stars when rating items such as this!"
2,More of the fun!!,"I really am into this show. It is still fun. I can see where it is heading for darker times, but that was obvious with the destruction of seasons ones villan. The cast shifts and characters die off or change. I felt some of it was rushed and not fully explained. But overall a good seasons worth of entertainment and still fun to watch.If you enjoyed the first season you should get in to this season also. I really Enjoy watching Heyerdahl as Druid.He makes every episode this character is in riveting he does a fine job of holding your interest."
2,Good but could have been great!!!!!,"The ""Pretty Toney"" album is a good album, but coud have been great had it included all the tracks that were supposed to be on the album. Many of the best tracks did not make the album due to sample clearence problems with the record label. These songs inlcude ""Heard it all before"", ""Gorilla Hood"", ""Toneys Money"", ""New Splash"", ""My Guitar"", ""Paychecks"", ""the Drummer"", ""Burnin"", etc. All these tracks can be found in cyberspace on the the GHOSTFACE KILLAH PRETTY TONEY B-SIDE album!If these tracks were inlcuded on the album it would have been a true classic, and comparable to great albums like ""IRONMAN"" and ""SUPREME CLIENTELE"". However, the album is still one of the best hip hop albums of 2004!"
2,This book deserves to be acknoledged as a master peice!!!,"When reading this book for a seventh grade book report, I fell deaply in love with it!!! It was all so realistic. I was given a month and a half to read the book and write the report, but now I am finished after four days!!! I love this book and will read it many more times in my life time! I belive Betty Smith Deserves great praise for her work in this book. My heart goes out to the Nolan family. They suffered and worked so much with little reward. The ending is extremely heart warming! Anybody that doesn't read this book will be greatly deprived!"
2,a great book for Historical romance lovers,"This is an engaging a count of life of Tess a girl who at a young age washed up on the shore of the Isle of May. With no memory of the life before then, she stays with the old caretakers of the isle. After the caretakers are dead a young man, Colin Macpherson washes up on shore. Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past. They are opposites,but you know what they say opposites attract. This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series. I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest. This is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel, but not what you call a trashy romance novel. It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels."
1,incorrect practice test answers,"I mean seriously, I paid good money for this book and the practice test answers are wrong. I don't recommend buying this and am going to try and get my money back."
2,Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Vista Series),"Detective Eddie Valliant has hated toons since his brother was killed by one, but now he has to help a toon that was framed for the murder of Marvin Acme, owner of Acme Corporations and Toontown, for playing patty-cake with the toon's wife. On the way, they have to avoid a suspicious character who wants to destroy all toons using a chemical that disintegrates everything. Stop and think about this movie for a minute, and you realize that we are unbelievably fortunate that it even exists. It's a great movie. I highly recommend this for the family and friends or just a Saturday with nothing to do."
2,Characteristics of Bad Writing,"Plain Style was written in 1985 by Christopher Lasch, a history professor who was frustrated with his students' lack of writing ability. There are six sections:Elementary Principles of Literary ConstructionConventions Governing Punctuation, Capitalization, Typography, and FootnotesCharacteristics of Bad WritingWords Often MisusedWords Often MispronouncedProofreaders' MarksApparently Lasch's frustration with students went beyond just their writing skills. ""I keep simplifying my course in 20th century American history, but the students keep getting dumber faster than I can simplify it,"" Lasch wrote in a letter to his father. ""Every year the illiteracy gets worse.""The current book was published after the author's death and includes an introduction by Stewart Weaver. The introduction is disproportionately long, taking up 42 of 121 pages."
1,"CURVED, NOT STRAIGHT","I bought these Trim Toenail Clippers because of ""NJMOM's Review"" above. NJMOM stated these clippers are ""STRAIGHT"" not ""CURVED"", WRONG, these clippers are CURVED! I emailed Farm & Home Supply Center for a ""RGA Number"" to return these clippers and never got one. I'll keep them but I'm not happy.If you want a straight cutting blade toenail clipper, these are not the ones. Get the Tweeezerman ones."
1,"Great translation, Poor packaging","I love the ESV translation and rate it five stars. I am upset that the publisher of this translation so poorly packages its product. This edition is a ""shirt pocket"" edition that seems well bound but has impossibly small print.What is needed is a ""coat pocket"" size edition of the New Testament that is bound in such a way that it will lie open of its own accord. The print size should be 10 or higher. This present edition will not lie open, and, what the more, the print is so small that only an ant could read it.Crossway publishes only two editions of the New Testament alone, and both are inferior. The print is too small to be read with enjoyment. Something has to change!"
2,"Comfortable, and less complicated than chest strap with watch combination","LOVE it. Comfortable, barely restricting, takes seconds to put on. I use it mostly for running, and it causes no problems. Also seems very accurate. Target zone alarm works well. Only real negative is that it's not particularly intuitive how to get between functions or how to change a setting. Explained well in manual, but not easy to remember on the fly. Overall thrilled with it."
1,Yawn,"This book and the setting seemed to have so much potential, yet Gloss failed to give soul to her characters. I never identified with any of the characters or cared about their future. The bad guys were evil, the heroine heroic, the cowboys shallow but no characterization beyond the stereotypes. Page after page of obstacles to overcome, yet no insights to be gained. If this book hadn't been a selection of my book group, I never would have stuck it out to the end."
2,Finally on CD,"I have this still on vinyl! it's great to see it out there on CD( even if its an import)! ""Super Strut"" and ""Rhapsody in Blue"" alone are worth it! One of the ""must haves "" for a collection of '70s jazz. Caan we get the rest of the CTI Catalog back out there???Please?"
2,great product!,"First off, this is a Huuuuge container! Bigger than I was expecting (about the size of a canister of oatmeal). Second, but most important, this nutritional yeast if yummy!! I had been buying in bulk at Whole Foods, but in my opinion this brand is better. Is is so fresh that the taste is better and the texture is awesome, almost with a little crunch to it, something that the other kind I used never had. Would definitely recommend it for sprinkling on veggies, popcorn, or using for all those yummy vegan ""cheese"" recipes."
2,Almost Heaven...,"Although released as a Boys Air Choir recording, this is rather misleading as Connor Burrows actually sings solo on this excellent choral offering.Connor, a former chorister from St.Paul's Cathedral as were his younger singing siblings Edward and Patrick, was I feel in many way sadly overlooked as a suberb treble, by the deserving success of his fellow chorister at the time Anthony way.Connor Burrows sharper, and perhaps slightly more powerful tones in evidence on this solo album, are well suited to the tracks chosen for this recording.He sings Faure's Sanctus beautifully, to match any other version of it I've so far heard, and the scales he reaches in Lacrimosa have to be heard to be believed!He's less well suited to singing the more gentle carols, Away In a Manger and In The Bleak Mid Winter, but overall a pleasing CD with a treble voice at its peak."
1,Eats tapes,"After about a year of use, ZR 40 started eating tapes. Do a google search on the topic, there are hundreds of people with the same problem. 'Remove Cassette' and 'Eject' (use those as keywords combined with 'Canon ZR' to view message boards postings) will appear on the screen, and that's the end of the toy."
2,good movie,"i had never purchased a dvd online before, and was pleased to find out that it was not damaged in any way. :)"
1,I would like to review it...,"but the seller (greenman19) took my money and I never received the item. Thus, I'm sure the movie is great, but I've still not seen it."
1,IS NOT CAPABLE WITH WINDOWS XP.,"You probably read towards the bottom of the description that it works with XP, and you'll even read it on the BACK OF THE PACKAGE, but it's not true. compaq still has no drivers for XP to recognize the PA-2, so if you have XP you'd better get a different mp3 player."
1,The French don't get it,"This movie was made just after the first resurgence of movie musicals, the first round being Moulin Rouge, Knight's Tale, and Chicago. So the French decided to get in on the trend and do a musical as well, but apparently this is much too happy a concept for the French personality, and they butchered the job. The movie is filmed like a British stage mystery; 8 women snowed into a house with a dead man, murdered by one of them, telephone cut, who's next to be killed? On this level alone, the movie is trite, unimaginative, and poorly done. Then to make it worse, at some point each one of the 8 woman will have a singing/dancing number, unbelievably bad choreography coupled with a song of no musical value, some of which are actually painful to endure.The only way to get anything out of this movie is to turn off the sound and just watch Catherine Deneuve act and move (except for her badly done dance number)."
1,Cable not what it is sold as,Cable is sold as having the ability to transfer video from a camcorder to a PC.It doesn't do it. I spoke to the company and they told me that there is no cable that does that. I asked them why thet advertised this cable as being able to do it and he told me I should have known better. They then charged me 15% to take the cable back. You would be smart to shop elsewhere. They don't know what their products do and they charge you for their lack of knowledge.
2,Pretty good!,"It doesn't appear as though there are any scratches to the CD that I can tell. However, when I opened the case, I did notice that someone had thumbed it up quite a bit. There were fingerprints all over the top of the CD. But the bottom looks to be alright. I'm taking it to a friend in a shop downtown next time I go to put the CD through their buffer machine just incase, but really I think it's fine. :)The movie came in it's original casing. I'm pretty excited to own it!"
1,Save yourself the trouble,"I'm pretty tech savy, and This is by far the worst experience ive had with ANY piece of electronica ever. Dont let the low price fool you, theres a reason for that. The drivers are terrible for this, Uninstalling this scanner requires 4 different programs, tech support charges you money for help (even though I bought this 2 weeks ago), and if you actually get the scanner to work it will take a good 25 minutes to get the 1200 dpi resolution scan. Also the software it comes bundled with (Scansoft Paperport) is horrible, i have 2 gbs of Ram and it ran as if i had 128 mb. the TWAIN compatibility is awful, and it isnt compatible with any third party software. I wish there was something good I could write about this scanner, Aftr 2 weeks I got fed up, returned the scanner and bought an HP. People please do not hurt yourself by buying this awful piece of junk."
1,What is this?,Sorry Guys for a old Classic Rocker like me I coundn't take this.!. That Singer is mostly likely the worst I have ever heard. I would rather puncture my eardrums then ever listen to this again!.
2,A Page-Turner Modern Day Frankenstein,"Bought this book as someone loaned me the next two in the series. I read them all within 2 weeks because I needed to see what was coming next, and it was hard to put them down. I hope to hear more about Deucalion's ""adventures""."
1,Does not work,"The charger does not charge my battery! And it does not plug in directly into the outlet. Rather, it has a separate cable that goes to the adapter itself and the outlet. It's junk! I am absolutely disappointed!"
1,CDs DO NOT HAVE SOFTWARE!!!!!,It turns out that this book only comes with Audio cds! Go figure: When the TOELF is mainly take on the CBT form
2,Awesome!,"My mom got this for me as a gift.We were going away on a trip to Florida,I get bored really easily but it kept me entertained!i think that they should manufacture all the neopets cause some other people might have other oppinions,they might want a zafara,quiggle,or a ixi they should widen the variety for all the neopets lovers!"
1,Disappointment on every page,"I'm so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel. If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting. He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead."
2,Very effective!,"I purchased these hoping to balance my swinging moods and night sweats. I've taken these for about two weeks and I notice I am sleeping better and seem a little more at ease. I haven't really noticed if I break out sweating at night still yet but , the biggest noticeable result is my finger nails! I am a life long nail biter and within this short time I've grown a pretty strong healthy set of nails. Very nice affect. I've increased my dose to twice daily and I will purchase these again!"
2,Awesome,This is the book that got me buying the other two in the series. I got it through the lending library on my kindle fire. I love the books that just appeal to me. Its much better than watching a movie.
2,A Classic...,"After reading ""The Time Machine"" by H.G Wells (Great book by the way), I started looking for more Sci Fiction/Dystopian style of books. Fahrenheit 451 is perfect! The author presents us with a world where books and anything ""upsetting"" are illegal. Things like creativity and thinking are nonexistent, and life revolves around being entertained, mostly by giant television screens... The main character of the story eventually changes, but I won't say too much more about that. I will say though that is one interesting book to read, especially with all the similarities it has with the current times. I also found it to be a very entertaining and not too difficult read, so I'd say anyone 8th grade and older should give it a try."
1,Weak,"This book was disappointing. It has too many major characters that are inadequately developed and too many plot lines to follow. The magic is an awkward add-in that the book could well have been written without.The first half of the book's plot, several of the characters, and the setting closely resemble one of C. J. Cherryh's Merovingian Nights stories, which was much better."
2,This is the book that everyone talks about,New growers who ask about starting are told to get this book. It brings them right up to date with everything. If you want to grow then get this. It even shows you how to get the right seeds.
2,Pellegrino is the best.,"I love Charles Pellegrino. I read this book four years ago and have read other books by him which possess the same brilliant scientific analyses yet contain an intimacy of the subject rarely found in nonfictional books. I could easily imagine standing beside him looking over the water in sorrow. Although the movie was truly outstanding, it cut some of the most crucial scenes out (the radio controllers). READ the book to find out what the movie missed!!"
2,Amazing Resource,This non-fiction book is used every year in my 4th grade class. It is a great addition to the Iditarod unit that I teach! It's loaded with artistic drawings and anecdotes. The kids love it! Highly recommend.
2,Enlightening and spell binding,"I read Titanic in the early part of 1997. I found the book fascinating, especially to one who knew very little of the disaster and the uncovering of the broken ship. I have recommended the book as a must read to many of my friends. Skip the movie and read the book!"
1,So-so,"It would have been a great family movie if it didn't have the sex scene's (they're benign for older children, but too much for the under 12 crowd). No one over 12 would call this a good movie. The script is weak and predictable; the direction is terrible."
2,Western Historical Romance author Julie Lence,"This was a very enjoyable read. The passion, attraction and love between Clint and Mattie could be felt through the entire book."
2,If only real women were like this . . .,"_The Descent_ is a movie featuring some very tough girls. Athletic, young, strong, mentally tough, and brave. When the going gets tough they meet the challenge and there is very little whining. Even when it comes time to die they face it bravely. In today's largely sedentary society where people are more concerned about political correctness than survival you aren't likely to meet many women (or men!) like this. But, one can always hope that there are still a few out there."
1,quality of this book,"the book is simple and makes the tough parts of econometrics understandable.however some core background topics are lacking... statistical depth for persons without a solid background in statistics. such is found in other texts(see jonston, gujurati, koutsoyannis, intrilligator).furthermore the book assumes prior knowledge of matrices,hence those without a solid background herein,at left at a loss."
1,Misleading rhetoric from self adulating Douglas,"Typical Douglas, in his self aggrandizing style, makes himself the authority on all crime related topics. If Douglas could downsize his ego, it would make it easier to read. For example, despite what the police, the state, and even his former colleagues in the FBI considered about the Ramsey case, Douglas ""alone"" has it solved -- i.e. the parents, from whom he took a substantial sum of money for his ""consultation"", are innocent. Incredible that Douglas makes such a conclusion, even though he wasnt privvy to the evidence, as the FBI was and who came to a markedly different conclusion about the parents' involvement.A waste of time to read this book. I have to agree with McCrary and Ressler, two greatly respected FBI profilers, that Douglas has gone Hollywood."
1,good but not great,"I was slightly disappointed in this book, knowing it was a Zane Gray. The storyline is a love story, but the author dwells more on his views and tries to usealot of words to explain the surroundings. The physical dimensions of thebook was too large & bulky. Again, if your interest is in love stories, thenyou might enjoy this book."
2,The Beauty of the Winter Solstice Season Incarnate!,"I bought this CD without even previewing it, as I'm a Moya fan. Even still, I was blown away by the beauty of it, the simplicity of the vocal lines, and the intricate way in which the tunes are arranaged. This is not your ordinary 'holiday' clone CD; with one more boring recording of the same dozen or so overdone Christmas carols! All of the tracks offer refreshing new 'advents' into the wonder of the Winter Solstice Season. A haunting, blissful album!"
1,Michael Bolton Jr,"WOW, this album is horrible!!! How can anyone with a fully functional brain buy this nonsense!!! This is contrived tripe targeted to people who don't know any better. I can't believe this type of CRAP is what people call music these days. This is safe, middle of the road JUNK! Music is going downhill and it's because CRAP like this is what sells these days. Whatever happened to taking risks in music? Not just pandering to people who are afraid of listening to music that actually challenges and provokes thought.Stop being braindead drones america and reject this manufactured sewage that american radio and record companies are trying to pass off as music. Awful just awful.......*gags*"
1,The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (Dover Thrift Editions),I didn't realize this book was written in such small print. This is the only thing I don't like about it. Sorry!
2,Simply the Best!,"Since 1980, I have been recommending this reference to over 23, 000 participants in my business writing workshops. I describe the book as invaluable, comprehensive, beautifully organized, and continuously updated. The Gregg Reference Manual is one of two essential tools for business, government and corporate writers: the other is a fat dictionary. The Manual is full of wisdom and articulates sound uniform rules with nicely nuanced exceptions. It is simply my writer's crutch."
1,False advertising for the product.,"I bought this DVR because the sales pitch on Amazon said something like, ""No TiVo service required"". That was a lie. The description for this item also never mentioned it was an analog only item.Trying to set up this DVR takes more time than most women giving birth.The manual is useless because it assumes you have a cable or sattelite source.If you want to throw you money away, buy this unit.I just wish there was a DVR for sale that doesn't require cable or sattelite."
1,This book was wack!,"We, for me, was not a good read. Perhaps if I was a mathematician and not have read the other dystopia books, Brave New World and 1984, it would have been a fun book to read as other reviewers have stated. Perhaps this was a serious book, but it was not an entertaining book to read. The book was a can."
1,Do not buy this HP 960 printer from ANTonline,"This ANTONLINE site has falsely advertized this HP Deskjet 960Cse Color printer on Amazon. After paying the advertized price of $61.97 plus $22.82 shipping and handling charge, they sent and delivered you a 6 oz size bubble wrapped pack Innovera Solid ink sticks/cartridge.No invoice or phone number in the package!"
2,Set it and forget it,"The TiVo wireless adapter is easy to install: plug it into the back of your TiVo and you're ready to go. My only difficulty was in getting it to agree with myLinksys WRT55AG Dual-Band Wireless A+G Access Point + Cable/DSL Router with 4-Port 10/100 Switch, which seems like a common configuration. It was a frustrating half an hour before I was able to get everything to play nicely together. (The detection process wasn't as easy as I thought it would be in this plug and play era.) You definitely need to know how your network is set up and be prepared to play with your wireless network configuration application.That said, once I got everything working correctly, the thing has been extremely easy to use: in fact, I haven't had to do anything to it since we put it in. The additional TiVo features that come with always-on access may appeal to some; for us, knowing that we can remotely program a show in a short time frame and still catch it is pretty cool."
1,Completely worthless,I bought this for my 4 year old daughter for her birthday. She loves rockets and I thought she would enjoy it. The pump is total junk and could not even pump enough pressure for a single flight before it broke. I spent an hour trying to fix it and the highest I've gotten the rocket to launch is a couple feet! This resulted in my daughter crying and the rocket getting thrown away. Do not buy this one!
2,Elizabeth George Speare rocks!,"Well, I've read of all of Speare's works that I can find, The Bronze Bow (awesome), The Sign of the Beaver, Calico Captive (finished it in a day), and The Witch of Blackbird Pond. This one beat them all! I never thought that she could write anything better than the Bronze Bow, but obviously, I was completely mistaken. In fact, this novel replaced my longstanding favorite book, Jane Eyre, as it slowly but surely crept its way up to number 1. I loved it; it's awesome; what else do I need to say? However, if you have no idea what good literature is, then you won't like this outstanding novel."
2,Experts in Reiki documentation,As with other Books by the Bronwen and Franse Stiene this is an excellent read on energy and Reiki. They really know their stuff!
1,Washington Deserves Better,"I bought this because I needed quick access to this classic for a paper I was writing. This is a very poor representation of this remarkable book; cheaply printed, no index -- junk! Don't buy it! totally useless for anything except a quick perusal by people who don't know any better!"
2,It worked for me..,"Thought this was not going to fit because I am a 44"" currently and I only ordered XL.. Like it very much"
1,"A great idea, but...","I bought this in particular because I had a USB device that no longer worked and it appeared to be because of a dirty connection. It really seemed like something an IT person should keep handy. Unfortunately, the cleaning heads are too big to clean a USB ""A"" cable end - which is what I really needed. If you want to clean the ports in your computer it will do that, but not the adapters themselves."
1,The onesies were too small and shrunk immediately--had to be given away.,The size ordered were what she normally wears--but were smaller than comparable clothes of the same type. Very disappointing.
1,Way Out Of Date - Better Reference Available,"With all of the program changes, this book is very out of date. You can get a lot of the same information for free at http://www.certificationguide.com"
1,Appalling. . .,"I checked this book out of the library after reading rave review after rave review.I wanted to like it, I really did, but I honestly cannot understand all the high marks. To me the book reads as if it were written by a 6th-grader. Characterization and storyline aside, the language itself is what turned me off. It seemed stilted, contrived, lacking in fluidity, and devoid of any real color; an amateurish effort at best.Perhaps this reads better in its native tongue, but the translation I read was atrocious. I promptly returned it to the library, shooting it soundly down the return bin with a force that it so richly deserved."
2,KYLIE NOW IS A 2 HIT WONDER IN THE UNITED STATES!,"Kylie is back in the States! Though she was never missing from the pop music world always making music.She had one hit here many a years ago with a remake of ""Loco Motion"", other than that Kylies music career here has been a bust.But now she is back with ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" which is currently #1 on the Dance Club Charts and already after just 3 weeks on Billboards Hot 100 is at #33 with a bullet.This song is getting heavy play on radio, video and anywhere else. With a high budget hot Devo-esque video for the new millenium and Kylie looking as though she hasn't aged a day. Could be digital computers, could be Kylie.However her first single off the forthcoming CD ""Fever"" is a catchy dance song that grows on you. A very subtle dance song with rhythmic beats and a catchy hook.I like it, and I think it is some of the best dance music to come from Kylie in a while."
2,...MaGicaL...,"Books by Shakespere is something you just don't read for fun, you read it slowly by savoring the moments of every word spoken by each character. By reading Romeo and Juliet, you would understand the tragidy because of love...and how they both would risk their lives for each other. Shakespere is the man who can really define true love."
2,Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell,"This is the 11th book in the delightful Agatha Raisin series. Ideally, the books should be read in sequence, starting with the first and my favorite, Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death. These books are light reading and a pleasant way to spend an afternoon or evening. At the title implies, Agatha and her new husband, James, discover that their marriage was a mistake. James then disappears after being attacked and is also suspected of murdering his rumored mistress, Melissa. Agatha, ever the amateur sleuth, is anxious to solve the crime and also clear her husband's name. She sets off with her old friend, Sir Charles, to do both. In addition to amateur sleuthing in the quaint villages around the Cotswolds, Agatha is grappling with getting older and feels ""the autumn of her life stretching in front of her."" We will have to wait for book #12 to find out how Agatha is coping with being single again."
1,Don't waste your money,"This toy was not that difficult to put together, but we have to put it back together each time my son plays with it. The set is always falling apart. The elevator broke after the first day. My friend bought this for her son as well, and she is just as frustrated as we are. I would not recommend buying this unless you have hours to spare re-assembly it and keeping up with all the parts that contiunally fall off it. [...]"
2,Return of the Dark Knight!,"Finally! A Batman movie that the real fans have been waiting for! I always thought the Warner Bros. animated series would always be the best telling of the Batman story, but this movie even gives that a run for it's money. Christian Bale gives a moving performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman, the best I've seen on the big screen anyway.My only compliant was the casting of Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Why not get someone with a little more depth. Maybe it's because I can only think if her as Joey on Dawson's Creek. I kept expecting her to say something like,""Wait! I still love Dawson!"".Overall the movie is great. Finally, a realistic Batman who isnt made to look like a dork!"
2,At the limit of human achievement.,"I saw Bjork in the swimming pool in Laugardalur, Reykjavik this summer. She was oh so friendly to her fellow swimmers and sunbathers. Her charm, hyper-normalcy and magnetic personality all shine through in her music. Post is a rare treat for the soul. In a way her melodic innovation here is as starlingly beautiful as that of the beloved Beatles."
2,Good,"How come everyone constantly praises Shakespeare, Keats, Whitman, etc.? No one ever mentions any Eastern poets, i.e. Basho. I get more from 3 of his lines than pages of other poet's works. Don't get me wrong - I take nothing away from Whitman & this is excellent poetry."
2,"Must read for anyone in a ""pressure cooker"" job","This is a very uplifting trip taken and proves that fancy, 'doodads' in our lives are really totally unnecessary for real to-the-bone happiness and sense of worth."
2,Added to my collection,I had almost all of the Jean Auel's books and needed this one to complete my collection. It turned out to be a book club size and I traded it to a friend for the full size version.
1,useless,"For some reason the makers of this item thought it would be wise to make each size ear piece fit a different bluetooth. The small fits my Jawbone, but does not fit my ear. The large fits my ear just fine, but does not fit my Jawbone. Save your money and find a different product."
1,ZZZZZ ZZZZZ ZZZZZ,"Wake me up when it's over! The only reason this movie gets two stars is for it's look and the excellent way the movie was shot. After that, it's just boring, repetitive dribble. I like the Hollywood movies better. ""Groundhog's Day"" is 15 times better than this unimaginative lump of crap."
1,Sucks,"Yeah well this movie was just terrible. Sandler tries paroding the classic cartoon musical but he fails in every way possible. I mean this is a stupid movie, one song is about how great the mall is and then another song has the logos of different stores singing to him. It's almost a marketing ploy to get people to go holiday shopping more. The film also tries to make the audience sympathize with Sandler's character but once again it fails, we have seen the Grinch and A Christmas Carol too many times to actually care about this Jewish Scrooge. This movie sucks all around with cheap gross out humor that may have worked better had it been live action but that would have defeated the purpose of the film. And one last comment, Why the hell is this a double disc DVD? All of Sandlers good and/or funny movies are singular yet this movie is terribe and it gets the extra feature treatment. This movie sucks."
2,Norpo 4 Quart Stainless Steel Rating,"When using this product the first time, the handle on the steamer came undone on one side & I had to fix it. Other than that, the product works extremely well and is very easy to use. Steams vegetables very nicely; would recommend this product."
1,Poop everywhere!,"These diapers are great for pee (never leaks), but terrible for poop (frequently leaks). We've been using these for the past 2 months (my daughter is now 4 .5 months, average size). She is breastfed so her poop is really runny. Even if I literally run to change her as soon as I hear her poop, it still regularly squeezes up and out all over her back and clothes. Most days she messes her clothes at least once. I'm going to try something else because this is just ridiculous (and gross!)."
2,Good feeling movie,This movie is not only funny but leaves you with a need to see it again and again. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler are the perfect match for the perfect romantic comedy. The twist on this romance (and the fact that it was filmed in Hawaii) gives the film a magical quality that warms the heart.
2,great peice,"The Peace Sign is very small but doesnt take away from the ""WOW"" factor of this necklace. The stones really ""glitter"" and catch the light. I was not disappointed at all. Fast delivery. I would order this again. Very Pretty"
2,really love it.,Does the job and I feel the tightness. Thanks for making a change that is a big difference for me. I would recommed others to buy it.
2,Great product!,"I bought it for my boyfriend. He is loving it! (and I'm loving it also on him)He is using it at least one time/day - every morning after shower, and sometimes during the day also. He told me that this lotion is very soothing; it's not sticky and/or oily. And I can tell you that he smells very nice (manly aroma) after applying this lotion."
1,"thing plot, boring read","Having grown up in the former Soviet Union, as soon as I started reading the book, I could tell immediately where Orwell drew his inspiration, as well as most details of peoples' existence. Reading the book was like re-visiting my childhood, as well as refreshing my mother's and grandmother's stories of the soviet life in the 1950's, all the brainwashings, terrible living conditions, propaganda, people disappearing in the middle of the night, etc. Basically, Orwell took soviet reality of that era, and then took it a few notches up, and then twisted it some. Art imitates life, so to speak. I'm not sure why everyone credits Orwell's imagination, then. Either way, the book is extremely boring, the plot is almost non-existent, nothing is really going on, the [unlikely] love affair took half-the book to unfold, and it wasn't even worth it."
2,This is the definition of mystery genre. Doyle at his best.,"This is the definition of the mystery genre, the best that Doyle has to offer.If you love a good read, a good mystery, a classic tale, get this book.For those who may not want to spend the cash for a hard cover, any of the paper back versions will do. But, the feel and experience of hefting a good hard back while following Watson and his friend, Holmes, should not be missed"
1,Not user friendly,The dish is not easy to take apart for cleaning and I wish I could put in it the microwave.
1,Not romantic enough,This could have been a good book but the writer puts in child rape which is gross and doesn't have the couple together enough. Teh war is used to take up space and the romance with the slave couple was more believable. Not enough passion and does not cover the war very well
1,Not Funny People,Not worth the time.Pros: there were several good one-liners; introduced me to new comediansCons: excess foul language; adultry;
2,Steven Wilson is GOD!,"Absolutely, mind-blowingly awesome! Steven Wilson is the master of multi-channel sound production. Only HE could put together a disc that can (almost) capture the experience of a Porcupine Tree concert. Not to be missed!"
1,I give it a full two stars because of the great artwork.,"It offers nothing but mystery. The first volume was left me a bit clueless. I had bought this hoping it would answer some of the questions of the first volume, like what is up with the ceremony, the main charector or even what does the TA's have to do with any of this. It appears to be extremely slow. So far there is nothing much more than talking with a little bit of action in the 2 DVDs. It makes it seem like you need to buy the next DVD for the answers, but they do not give enough episodes per DVD for price and I usually do not buy any more of a series if I did not enjoy the first few episodes, more of less the first 7. This DVD make me feel like I would be wasting money if I were to finish the series. I recommend watching one of the Gundam series, at least that might offer more action, plot or even comedy."
2,"Good, fast reading story","This book was referred to me by a friend and it turned out to be a story that I coulnd't put down. From the beginning, it is a great story that captured my attention and brought a new realization to the happenings of the world around me. Overall, it was a fantastic read and something that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good book based on a true story."
1,"Orwellspeak, Sum Total Zero","George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is all catchphrases, Big Brother, Thought Police and Newspeak and it is absolutely rendered down to a zero summation, a monumental ode to nothingness, an ideologically streamlined state of unbelievable being.Chris Roberts(speak)"
2,This is actually better than the Live From New Haven DVD! 13 extra minutes.,"I have the Live From New Haven DVD and wasn't very impressed with the audio and picture quality. This VHS has a better picture quality and it sounded better. Not only that but it had back stage footage AND Pat Benatar performing ""Little Paradise"" as the last encore which wasn't shown on the Live From New Haven DVD/ or that 1998 VHS release. Also included was the video Love Is A Battlefield as it was a quick promo for the upcoming LP Live From Earth. I cannot find anywhere where she sings Little Paradise Live so I feel like the lucky few now!"
2,Pretty cool,"Let me first say I'm into HipHop(real Hiphop, slug, Atmosphere, etc). I have latelly been checking out the Euro scene of music(I don't know bought a Bmw could have been influencing me lol). I like this chick(not only cute) but she is cute and beats are catchy. Their music makes wanna make me drive fast. The older I get(30), the more I listen to beat and the complete way the music is put together. So liking the Goldfrapp stuff. So I by these cd's for my girl(while secretly ripping them to my zune). Right now working overtime to go check out Europe and stuff(not better than America, but different obviously the as an European visiting here. Good catchy cd, interesting use of instruments and keyboards. Did I mention she is cute little thing. Check out their videos they are a trip."
2,A Whale Of A Story,A historical sea story that is well written and well researched.It makes you want to know more about the whaling industry & uses of whale oil.
1,Terrible,"This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart."
1,Mara Wilson,I Love Mara Wilson she is cute and beautiful.I also loved her in Matilda. I think that Matilda was beautiful.she is a good actress.she was a cute girl in Mrs.Doubtfire.I think that she was very good at that part
1,Horrible,"Don't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots. They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money. First off the boots had spots around the lower edge(where the boot and the rubber bottom meet) where there were huge holes where there was missing glue. Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house. They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on. They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards. The ""insole"" they put in the shoe is a joke at best. It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite. Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear."
1,Difficult to follow,"I'm a student and am taking a class using this book. I've found it very difficult to follow and short on explanations. Without additional resources, I would not be able to learn the material in this book."
1,Nothing superb about Holmes.,"""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is the first (and now only) Sherlock Holmes book I have read (only because my book club chose it) and I was beyond bored with it. Nothing was mysterious or suspenseful about it. It was full of babble and slow adventures. Sherlock Holmes was hardly even in it, since Dr. Watson was the narrator and main experiencer of events. Very overrated in my book. I do not recommend."
2,WHOA! SILKIES!!!,"This, too, was one of several pair of sleep pants for my son's Christmas stuff. He's NUTS about them. They make him want to make a running start to jump & slide on the bed! MORE PLEASE!! Possible to get them in a plaid?"
2,"It's Entertainment, Folks","I am so tired of reading reviews from people who think every movie should be an artistic masterpiece, or at the very least, should have a poignant message. This is one of the most entertaining films my wife and I have seen in a long time, and none of the people involved with its production have anything to apologize for. It unquestionably delivers exactly what Bruckheimer, et al intended, and it does not pretend to be anything else. If I wanted something artistic or meaningful, I would have looked for word ""Miramax"" on the outside of the box - a studio that has made many wonderful movies, but not the type of high impact, SIMPLE fun Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have delivered so well. Sometimes, it's just what the doctor ordered.Turn out the lights, turn up the volume, break out the popcorn, have a few drinks, and enjoy..."
2,Frommer's Alaska,This is a good summary book to have. I found it informative. Although this book by itself is not enough for planning a trip to Alaska. It gives highlights but I found myself needing additional information.A good buy
2,A Big Smile,I bought this book as a gift for my daughter. She was thrilled when she opened it. We had been looking for this book in local bookstores and was unable to find it here. I should of looked at amazon a long time ago. Thank you for helping me to make my daughters christmas a little brighter.
2,TIVO wireless G Adapter,Attach to your TIVO and it works very nicely. I have two TIVO's so I can transfer between them both.
2,"Fits well, looks great","The Under Armour HeatGear T Top shirt fit as expected. I purchased a size Large as I normally wear a Large sized shirt, and this shirt fit nice and snug, not too tight. It was exactly as I had hoped it would be. As most other Under Armour products, it's very breathable and stretchy. I've had workout shirts that fit tight around the shoulders, but this shirt feels very comfortable in that area and all over, while still remaining snug against the skin. It's not outrageously priced, but it's not cheap either - obviously you're paying a little premium for the Under Armour name.My only wish is that I had a little more muscle so I'd look a little better in it!If you're looking for a full set of top and bottom, check out the Under Armour HeatGear Legging Bottoms. I bought the bottoms with this top and they match perfectly."
2,Hours of Fun for my 4 and 6 year olds,"We purchased this game a year ago and my girls still love to play it. Lot's of activities, they love to decorate the floats and watch the parade."
2,Of Mice and Men,"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck was set during the Great Depression in CA. In this book there are two characters called Lennie and George. They are the two migrant workers, who had travel together and they want to save some money and buy a ranch of their own. George is a small person, Â¡quick and dark of faceÂ¡. He always takes care of Lennie and he act like a father to Lennie. Lennie is a huge man and has a mind of a child. He always gets into trouble. Every time when Lennie gets into trouble, George always gets him out of the trouble. Lennie acts like a son to George. Will George and Lennie make their dream come true or will LennieÂ¡s weak mind and strong body destroy their dream?The book Of Mice and Men is a good book. I will rate it as four stars. In this book, it has a lot of conflicts and events. Also it tells us how important friendship is event if it is a very hard time. Friendship will help you get through anything."
2,Good Coffee Warmer,"This is my first coffee warmer, and I like it. It keeps the coffee pretty warm (it won't burn your tongue, but it's pretty warm).Out of curiosity, I set yesterday's cold coffee on the warmer and it managed to warm the cold coffee.BTW, this coffee warmer will keep a bowl of soup warm as well."
2,Get this and Livecrime,"To really get the complete Mindcrime experience, I would recommend getting the Operation: Livecrime DVD as well. If you can find the one with the booklet, even better. Watch the first part on the Livecrime DVD and the 2nd part on this DVD. The original Mindcrime with the original lineup cannot be topped. For the most part, they did a great job considering they don't have the budget for live shows they had in the early 90's. Mindcrime 2 is not at the level of the first part. Who expects it to be?"
2,Magical Adventure,"Anita Jeram's book, I Love My Little Storybook, is a favorite of my 6-year-old son. The illustrations are magical and whimsical. As a reader or a listener, it's easy to wish yourself into this magical world of adventure. It's a wonderful bedtime story and has become a favorite to give as a gift to other children and expectant mothers."
1,Not sure about veracity of the material,"The author begins with the statement that she has probably spiced up the material a lot. Since, most of the author's story is around her sexual encounters, and she has stated that she has spiced up the material, it is not clear how much truth exist in this autobiography. Read it with a grain of salt. The book, however, does provide some interesting insight on the Saudi society."
2,very good,"I bought this as a gift for my parents and while I haven't actually seen it in action, they tell me they love it and will never go back to normal tv. The only caveat is that it must be connected to the Internet, and if you don't have an Ethernet cable that you can easily plug into the back, make sure you get the wireless adapter that goes with it (sold separately of course)."
1,Ehhh =/,"To be honest I didn't really like this book, it doesn't really have spells just chants and potions and stuff, I would recommend buying somethine else."
2,"A fantastic movie, never mind the ""adaptation"" label","Of course purists will always cry foul at the ""messes"", ""disasters"" and ""heresies"" Hollywood performs on their little ""possesions"". Since I did not carry this burden, I was able to enjoy Constantine on its own, no preconceptions or rules. This movie rocks, plain and simple, and all of the ignoramus who insist on the ""adaptation"" label will surely fail to judge it on its own right.I am not a comic book fan, and I did not read any of the ""HELLBALZER"" (as a so-called fan of the comic books mistakenly typed, TWICE). I enjoyed ""Constantine"". And as for those who also did, kudos. Don't let the comic book crowd make you feel any less. After all, their limitations and views are theirs alone to suffer..."
2,Cute shoe but!!!,Really cute sexy shoe but they do run small and they are very high as well but it said they were stilettos. I love them and I also look the red color.
1,Another tax-loss movie?,"You know you're watching a bad movie when your partner leans over to you and, without ever having seen the movie before, outlines the plot in detail, including accurate descriptions of most of the scenes to follow minutes after the opening credits have run.What on earth was Bruckheimer thinkning when he made this? I can only assume he had a contract with the studio to produce a certain number of movies and this was one of his 'fillers'.An unlikely plot to say the least, the acting was substandard and John Goodman, usually a decent actor, looked embarassed to be associated with this, seemingly hanging about in scenes waiting for his check to clear before he could leave.I've no doubt this movie earns at least 4 stars from many people who use this site; the teenage girl and mid 20's male I'm sure think this is an 'awesome' movie. Utter dross; Hollywood really needs a fresh injection of writing talent."
2,Good,"I had never heard Garbage before I listened to Version 2.0 at a listening kiosk at Tower Records, but I was immediately hooked. It's like a modernized Pretenders on steroids. I'd definitely recommend it. END"
1,BAH,I have never read such a terrible book in my life. Let me refer you to the excelent book by Henri Gamanche THE MASTER BOOK OF CANDLE BURNING. It is a far superior text containing much more relaiable material.
2,One of my favorite mysteries,"I can't recommend this highly enough. Years ago it was the first eye opener for me that history might not be all the textbooks said it was, but this time I simply enjoyed the humor and interactions of the characters. I think it possible that Richard III is right up there with Hamlet in my list of ""dreamy maligned heroes."" Such a great, fast read."
2,Great!,"I enjoyed this waist cincher! it corrects my posture, and makes me look slimmer!However, I think it stretched out a bit... Or I lost some inches!"
2,An Extraordinary Novel!,"This Novel, Summer of My German Soldier, is an interesting book. It is about a girl named Patty Bergen, her small home in Arkansas becomes a site of a camp keeping German prisoners during World War II , even though she is Jewish she begins to vision, a nazi, Anton not as a Nazi but as a true friend. Anton escapes from the camp site and Patty takes responsibility for him, feeding him, clothing him, and even sheltering him. Only one person knows this so far and that person is the house keeper, Ruth. She keeps him in a shelter on top of the garage, one time even Anton once risks his life to save Patty from her father. This book is a treasure to keep and once you start reading it you will not put it down. I also encourage you to buy this book, and also I'm looking for the sequel to this book."
1,poor quality.,"I sent this set back within seconds of inspection. The corners were already dented, the glue holding the thin felt in place on the sides and corners had already failed. I went to my nearby store and purchased a much higher quality set for the same money. this is not a good set for any serious backgammon player."
1,Piece of junk,"Worst printer I've ever bought. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!!! Constant Paper Jams, thick black line through scans/copies even after troubleshooting, annoying polling every couple minutes. This is probably going to be the last HP printer I ever buy. I was ripped off for a premium-line printer. I'm replacing it with a cheaper but more reliable Canon MP160 which does everything this one was supposed to and I've never had a single problem with it."
2,"Hey give it some credit, listen to me.","So far this game hasn't received any credit, well not much.To start off the graphics are good, and the sound is good too.I haven't seen one glitch yet, I'm sorry. The battles are some what slow, but you have to admit that it is cool to have an invitory and equipping items. If you find glitches, return your game! My game is fine, and I'm past Moria. You can switch your characters, that is a really cool option. But the osund goes away in battles sometimes, thats not so fun. I like to have energy in my battles, but the battles are slow. That's why this game got a 7 out of 10. O' and I'm 14 years old, I'm just not signed up with Amazon. Fun game for younger kids.GRAPHICS: 8 out of 10SOUND: 6 out of 10GAMEPLAY: 7 out of 10OVERALL: 7 out of 10"
1,"Yes, it's that bad.","Super crappy supernatural thriller that makes a fine comic book into a sham with a horrible performance by Keanu Reeves and sub par special effects that are an insult to a lot of the technical wizards working in Hollywood now. To call this movie an insult to their craft is an understatement and pretty pathetic considering how lazy the production of this film really was. I have heard a lot of praise about Rachel Weisz's performance, and she deserves all of it because she is the only good thing this movie really has. She's so good in fact that you do feel sorry for her for even putting in an effort to give the audience someone to cheer for.Too bad the rest of the movie was not as professional as her performance was."
1,Total shock,"Don't belive the hype. 2 good tracks, one being the single Bridge Over Troubled Water. He is so talented but this cd is baaad. What happened? I loved him on the show, but the song choices are lame to say the least. Maybe the next one will be better. Better to burn than to buy this one."
2,Buddy the cat is the best,"I heard about the CD with clips and an interview with Ry Cooder on NPR and immediately ordered it. The book and CD are just great. As a union member myself I was glad to have a musical record of some of the history of the movement, which has not been taught for years in the schools. Buddy and his friends journey across a dusty and violent America and try to find work. The pictures on the story book are priceless. The travelers have many adventures, and Buddy gets thrown in jail for being ""red,"" such a great joke on the union busters. Enjoy! I sent another copy to my brother in California, he loves it too."
1,One hundred spastic pages,"I tried really to follow the story...the names are all the same,I kept constantly referring to the family tree to figure out who was who...it's more science fiction than believable...insominia disease of the entire village?!, Just too difficult for me to enjoy. I hated it and only got as far as 158 pages before I gave up."
2,Very good heart wrenching story,I read this book many years ago. I was touched by her story. I can not speak for the Kindle formatting on this. Only to the books content. Excellent.
2,A Book That Is Worth a Second Look,This book is great. It is very informative. It is easy to read and understand and has alot of pictures. i would recommend this book for any one wanting to learn about Chinese Medicine.
1,Cone Boobs,"I have the Le Mystere Safari T-Shirt Bra and love it, but this bra is just not as good. The quality is not great; the fabric is harsh and the cups of the bra are very stiff. When I tried it on, the bra separated my boobs very far apart. It made me look like a 1950's housewife with cone boobs. No cleavage, total separation, very pointy. Just not attractive.As for the sizing, I didn't feel that the cups were too small. I am a 32 G in other Le Mystere bras and the fit was proportional. The cups just made my chest look unattractive."
2,Remarkable work of history,"Benny Morris rose to the forefront of Israel's 'New Historians' in the 1980's with the publication of 'Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem,' which provided radically new evidence which altered modern perceptions of the region forever. Morris retains his important findings in Righteous Victims and expands on them, covering virtually the entire history of the Israel-Palestine conflict. I found the earlier chapters leading up to the creation of the State of Israel on the earliest Zionist settlers to be particularly interesting; Morris presents a picture which indicates that the current bloodshed is by no means a product of natural necessity. The ethnic cleansing of Palestine and subsequent military occupation is the cause. However, Morris becomes overly ideological in the concluding sections of the book, allowing his harsh realist politics to creep in. Nevertheless, this is arguably the most comprehensive single volume about the history of the conflict."
1,not reccomended,"Would not purchase this item again. Used in spare bedroom for guests. Hardly used, until now. Hoping top have Xmas guests use. First to lay on it, and center ring pooped.Still usable, but uncomfortable. The second night used bed hissing sound and a large leak appeared. They provide plastic to repair leaks, but do not provide any adhesive. I have to eat it now because I had until 11/12/12 to return.I can get partial credit, not including shipping if I just had just kept the box and shipping label for 3 months."
2,Fire Emblem on Game Cube,"This is a great game!! There are lots of new units like dragons and the story line is prety good. It has the weapon triangle like the rest of them, but the magic triangle changed which stinks. But, still in this one, you can give your units extra experience, you get to forge your own weapons, and you can change the color which is cool. The graphics are a bit better. But, still the same types of batte maps. Overall, this game is awesome!!!"
2,"Comment on the review ""Hard to clean"" posted on 8/25/03","I don't think the author's comment is referring this model because this rice cooker does not use the floating ball mechanism in its valve. I have the same experience as T. Panar ""belldandi"" on using the rice cooker. Cleaning is very easy. And it works very well on different type of rice."
2,Rock Solid on Cross-Continental Road Trip,"I hooked this rack up to the trunk of my 2007 Camry, strapped in a couple bikes, and headed West to Seattle from Chicago. I had absolutely no problem throughout the entire road trip and both bikes arrived safely :) The rack seemed extremely solid and barely moved even at Montana highway speeds. The outermost bike definitely sways a little more than the inner one, but i think that is just the natural flexing of the support arms. The rack was easy to put on and the bikes stay firmly in place using the built-in straps. The only thing Saris forgot is a way to keep the front wheel/handlebars from swaying. I fixed this using a couple short pieces of rope through the spokes and around the frame.Overall: super secure rack that can survive 2000 mile road trips"
1,Waste of paper,"I recently had to read this book as part of my English GCSE and I can honestly say that much paper has been wasted and our trees are being destroyed to churn out a book, which is quite frankly absolutly awfull. I also am very glad that I was not around to ever meet Thomas Hardy as from this book it sounds to me that he may well of been a manic depresent, also in most, if not all, of his other books they all end in a very sad a depressing way. Hardy describes Henchard as 'dogged' and i feel if you want to read this you too will have to be dogged and determind to start and finish this book."
1,very poor construction,"For the price this very simple apparatus should function flawlessly. Its one job is to hold sand. I wish I noticed out of the box that one of the edges of the bottom where it meets the frame was bowed out enough to leak sand (salty looking sand) all over my desk. Annoying. I scooted as much sand out of the way as I could to duct tape this edge on the inside. When I have the time, I'll probably dump out the sand and tape all the edges because I don't trust it.The hassle this has caused is definitely not zen."
1,Reads like a high school English project,"""The Greatest Generation"" reminds me of biographies printed for class reunions or interviews published in a small town newspaper. In ""The Greatest Generation"" Tom Brokaw profiles dozens of people who served their country during World War II.Most of the profiles follow the template of: X did this during the war, X had this memory of the war, X married Y and they had these children, the war changed X in this manner, this is how X's family think the war influenced X, this is why X's friend or co-worker thinks X is a great person, and this is what X thinks of the generations to follow.Using this formula made it easy for Brokaw to do three to ten page bios on the people he met. The profiles all seem generic after awhile. The book packs very little emotional impact perhaps because it is written in an overly sentimental manner. There are very few interesting stories or anecdotes for a book that goes over 400 pages.I expected something better from Tom Brokaw."
1,british and boring,"first of all, this is a book written by a british author for british women. i could understand most of the quips in the book, but not all of them.then all the advise. some good (and primitive), some not so good (unless you have the personality of joan rivers).i didn't like this book at all, but i thought i would give it a chance after reading the prequel."
1,NOT a 'breed specific' book on Chesapeakes,"I purchased this book thinking it was going to be a book specifically talking about Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, it wasn't.I would venture to guess that if you took the few pages about Chesapeakes OUT of the book, ALL of the books written by this author geared toward a specific breed would all read the same!Not a book to buy if you are looking for information on Chessies."
2,Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian,"This was a good movie I liked it, but since this is the last movie that all four of the Pevensies are in Narnia together I really have no desire to watch the last film.The battle scene was awesome but not as good and the first film battle. But this wasn't a bad movie, I might buy it on DVD."
2,Simple to use,I got one of these for our office. This model is a big step up from the previous model (679) that it replaced. The 679 has only 1 button from which to access all functions. The 690 has 3 buttons so you can quickly access the function that you want. It appears to be durable & accurate. Highly recommended.
2,"So fun, so smart!",This toy is amazing! It guesses what you're thinking every time! I think this is a fun toy for people of all ages! I love it!
1,Don't buy this book unless you already know JAVA,"The reviews here are deceiving. Trust me. Unless you have already read another book on Java, you will have a hard time understanding it. The examples are fragmented and never complete. The author assumes that you know Java already and did not even bother to provide examples for many of the concepts. This may be a good book for intermediate level JAVA programmers, but it is definitely not for beginners. If I didn't know C++ at all, I would have thrown this book into the trash can the first day I read it. This ranks up there as one of the worst programming books I've ever read, a total waste of my hard-earned money. Thanks to the deceiving reviews, I now need to spend more money to get a real beginner JAVA book."
1,TERRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk."
1,Not very impressive...,"Anecdotal stories without much true insight, and CERTAINLY not the level that some of these reviewers claim. I continue to get the impression that some people suffer from being overly enamoured with the author or the concept of T4A, and thus lose sight of the fact that this book is really a lot of fluffy stuff wrapped around four lines of text. Honestly, the Four Agreements are wonderful points to live by, and I do every day. However, it seems quite bizarre to me that one would need this book (or any other) to explain what these four simple sentences mean:1) Speak your thoughts clearly2) Don't ASSume3) Don't take things personally4) Do your bestFolks, these are NOT hard things to understand, and you definitely don't need books to figure this stuff out (well, ok, maybe some of you do :-). Do yourself a favor. Print out the four points I've listed above and you'll save yourself lots of money. Peace."
1,Disappointing,"This book is getting mixed reviews. It seems like friends of the author say its great. Those who tried to actually use the book are disappointed that everything is so out of date. This edition was not updated since the first edition and is now really out of date. Things change, but sloppy research is always out of style."
2,What a great experiment!,"The Brass Fantasy was a wonderful group that Lester Bowie led--kind of a late 20th century interpretation of the New Orleans brass band, but playing the music of the day. It's a real kick in the pants to hear some of the pop tunes as they are interpreted here. The tuba player rocks! Forget the oom-pah! My favorite is their interpretation of that jukebox favorite, Crazy. This is a great album for someone with a fairly open mind and a good sense of humor."
2,Outstanding!,"At first I was just neutral about the CD. Some songs were great while a few I felt were geared to the teenie bop generation. After listening to the CD about 50 times so far..(Im addicted to it)...anyway, after listening to it so many times Ive gotten to the point where I love every song on there. Some songs dont fit in to any particular genre but there are some that will be played on the radio and a lot Im sure. This CD is well worth it. He is so talanted. My CD player broke last night and Im feeling the effects of withdrawel as we speak."
2,Stunning and brilliant,"I must echo some sentiments in saying that Ian McKellen was robbed of the Oscar by a hyperactive goof. He broke my heart in his portrayal of James Whale, and not in an emotionally manipulative way. Brendan Fraser was incredible as always, and Lynn Redgrave cracked me up. This movie was ingenious, and if you liked it, definitely read ""Father of Frankenstein."""
2,A great classic,"I remember reading this when I was young. I found it again on Amazon and bought it to share with my kids. A sci-fi classic! I would recommend this to all kids, young and young-at-heart."
2,Best Flamenco Album of Azucar Moreno,"Azucar Moreno is a Spanish band with 2 lead lady singers. I first came across this group in the flamenco movie ""El Amor Brugo"" - the original classic music is composed by De Falla, a Spanish composer. Via Amazon I was able to purchase 4 albums by Azucar Moreno. The Exitos Originales album has the true Flamenco pop music - it also features the song ""Azucar Moreno"" that appears in the movie I spoke of. The other tracks are similar in nature and could have been part of that movie. This makes the album vary Flamenco balanced."
1,not what I expected,"I bought this product to repair the rand on my hiking boot. It went on easily, but after it dried, it peeled right off the leather part of the boot,and I was able to peel it off the rest. The product was also shiny, very unlike the original rand. I followed the directions for cleaning the boot prior to application."
1,Sylvia Browne's Book Of Dreams,"I was disappointed in the book because too much was relied upon letters written to her. I would have liked more of her own imput. Maybe I just didn't understand it, I don't know."
2,very good beginning,"the sound of this record is very particular, may be a little precarius, but you can see right there the talent and the sign of the band.this album is very enjoyable!"
1,PLEASE,You sure must have missed a lot on your JOURNEY.The Amish are the most backwards group of misfits I have ever encountered.Where kids beat on when you were they? Were wives talked down to and belitted? Were animals beat and starved? I thought not. Maybe you should take another trip...and tell it like it really is. I do not think much of your book. It is NOT TRUE
2,Perfect,"I was a little concerned about buying this item by the Internet, but everything was really easy and the service was perfect. The items arrived in very good conditions and on time. Wonderful service!"
2,One of the best Catholic movies ever,"This is an amazing Catholic movie which portrays the entire life of the great Saint Padre Pio. It shows his humility, his struggles with the devil, and everything an orthodox Catholic and Christian would want out of a film. It doesn't overlook the temporal problems of the Catholic Church such as the pride, jealousy, and vindictiveness of the powerful opponents of Padre Pio, but it portrays this not as if most of these opponents were evil, but simply that they did not understand, and even in Padre Pio's words they were simply trying to protect the Church. The importance of the three religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience come to the forefront in this film in many ways. This movie has an amazing ending so it is worth watching until the end."
1,Noise Pollution,"Every time I hear that song ""One Wish"" it makes me want to throw up. I hope he never makes another CD."
1,I Wish I Hadn't,"This book cost me the FRM last year. I made it the center of my study program. The book's writing is atrocious; there are gaps in what is covered; and there are many errors and misstatements. I wasted six weeks struggling with this book. When I finally realized my mistake, it was too late to rescue my study program, and I failed the exam. I am very disillusioned with Jorion and GARP. This shoddy, overpriced paperback makes me think they are in it just for the money. This year, I have signed up for the CFA exam instead. So far, I have been very impressed with their study materials."
2,Wow,"In The Heart of The Sea won the National Book Award for a reason. Philbrick's attention to detail, his research, and his style all make this incredibly tragic story come alive in a very fresh way. There were moments when I felt driven to tears, moments when I was completely disgusted, and moments when I couldn't help but laugh. This book is good for anyone interested in whaling, the ocean, survival stories, or just an amazing read."
1,Baby WET,These are awful. I have to change these constantly because they do not pull moisture away from baby's bottom. So annoyed that I bought such a big box.
2,Great Book!,"I picked up this book because I was just in need of something to read. Once I began, I could not put it down! Farenheit 451 is set in a not so far away distopian future where media rules and books are illegal. In this place, firemen start fires on books rather than put fires out. Guy Montag is fireman who begins to see the truth in books. When this is discovered though, he has to run for his life. This is a great book for pretty much everyone, but there is aare heavy phycological thoughs throughout the whole book, and sparce mild language. Overall, if you want a great book to read, choode this!"
1,"Good Start but, ...","Good start. But, sort of slumps downward and never comes back.Might be ok as a reference."
2,My winter time fav!,Love this spray- it's great to use especially for the areas of your back you can't seem to reach.
2,Don't give up too soon.,"This book defeats a lot of people which is a shame because it is truly deserving of all its praise. It took me awhile, in fact several years to get going on it. The first couple of tries I was like what huh? I don't get it. Finally it made sense to me and I've now read it several times and will read it many more. So If you are having trouble getting going on this book try again and again and eventually you will get it, it will be worth it when that happens."
1,Tapes don't work for me.,"There are a few things I didn't like about the tape. Firstly, the price is too high. Secondly tape is inconvenient for a spoiled by technology user. It's much easier to work with DVDs and their menus. And lastly, I realized that I'd rather spend 70 dollars on 4 monthly group lessons and learn basic steps and routines of one dance then try to master all by myself while watching a tape."
2,Dinosaurs are back and you're lunch!,"Do you hear that buzz? Don't worry, it's not a swarm of killer bees. It's the buzz surrounding this highly anticipated first novel by Justin Strauss. Justin is an academically trained paleontologist, so you can be assured that he knows his dinosaur details.The book? Entirely gripping. If you like crackling, intelligent fiction, dinosaurs, and futureshock stories with twists and turns, then put on your bloody running shoes and sprint to the store to pick this up. Alternatively, whip out your credit card and get it now online!The characters are hewn from classic science fiction material and the action is first-rate. The reader will immediately notice that Strauss swings effortlessly between heart-pounding imagery and the subtleties of humanity without ham-fisted literary tactics common in the science fiction genre.Somebody should contact the movie studios about this. On second thought, they'd just screw it up. Go. Get this book."
1,don't buy this cd if you don't like chick bands,this CD blows. tubthumbing was cool at first and then it got old real fast. the rest of the songs blow. I am so sick of this CD if anyone wants to buy it from me... wait I'll pay you to take it. I think they need to have a 0 rating instead of 1. don't buy this CD
2,Simply Gorgeous!,"These are simply gorgeous and they feel like a high end product, very high quality! Beautiful lace! I love these thigh highs hosiery!"
2,Great frothing pitcher,"This is a great pitcher. Steaming milk in this pitcher is quick and easy. The bottom of the pitcher and the sides get hot when the milk is steamed, which is very helpful in determining when to turn off the steaming wand. It is well built, easy to clean, and dish washer safe. Would definitely recommend."
2,An Excellent Portait of Puritan New England,"Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a vivid (and accurate) portayal of life in Puritan New England. The prejudices, superstitions and institutions of the society are expressed so well that contemporary readers, who have little knowledge of New England's history, are able to feel the oppression and religious pressures that were common in that society. Indeed, this work is comparable (if not superior) to Arthur Miller's Crucible."
1,Kind of light and fluffy.,"This book is very entertaining, and has maddening pace, kind of like the Matrix. In fact this book is a lot like the Matrix. It's about as complicated as The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. I take dumps more dense than this. Reading this book will take about and hour and a half, though it will only feel like 20 minutes. Think Curious George. I can't wait for the movie (I hope Spielberg directs it, and finishes the last sentence)."
1,pleasent fluff,"this was pleasent and satifying fluff. It's always worth while to watch Baal's machinations, but it would have played better as an episode.Sorry I can't say more."
1,Worst diapers out there.,"Pampers Swaddlers were the best diapers when my son was a newborn, but we have found that all Pampers in sizes larger than 2 are awful! I much prefer both the Target and Walgreens brands. Pampers leak every single time he wears them (he is 18 months now) so this leads to SO much more laundry! I would NOT buy them again."
1,It's Ciggie time!,"About the only interesting factor in this boring, languid flick is watching Keanu lighting up an endless supply of smokes. Even in the rain, he's whipping out that good ole lighter and puffing away. Only thing is he looks and acts like someone whose never puffed anything stronger than hemp. He doesn't appear to enjoy al those ciggies. I'm around dedicated smokers all the time and when they inhale that smoke, they appear transported into a little bit of heaven. Oh, yeah, somewhere in this convuluted mess are computer generated monsters who look like they were created by a kindergarten class."
2,This book grows on you,"I started to buy the book at the bookstore and put it down -- on several trips. But, it kept drawing me in. Finally, I ordered it, and I am enjoying it very much. I find myself going back to it repeatedly -- picking it up when I finally sit down with some decaf at the end of the day or when I'm looking for an idea for a particular room. There's a lot here -- and it's fun to read, too."
1,not happy,"great concept, however, tuning is imposable, you get some horizontal instability 98% of the time. but when you get it, it looks decent!"
2,An affordable collection,"Amazon completely understands how complicated it is to find a collection that other stores are not selling anymore. If you are looking for anything that was 10, 15, or a few decades ago, Amazon has it all. Old with the new, and new with the old."
2,Timeless Classic,"I enjoyed this book a lot, once I got past the slow parts. Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock. Since she won't reveal the identity of the father, she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter ""A"" on her chest for the rest of her life. She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around, so at the end of the book, people refer to her as ""Angel"" instead of ""Adulterer.""This is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period. When we do something wrong, the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character. One event does not define us. It's our entire lives that should be taken into account. I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. Redemption is possible for anyone, regardless of their sin. Also, the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader, suffers enormously because he doesn't confess. This is a good point. When we hide our sins, the only person it ultimately hurts, is us."
2,a shattering ending to a rather slow book,"Though I consider this book a masterpiece I personally like ""Animal Farm"" better. The ending of 1984 is fantastic..shocking and all around genius...but before reaching that climax, one is exposed to a long and dreary relationship that is based more on hate of their surrounding then actual love. I wish Orwill had paid just a little more attention to the characters. They could have made the book go by a little faster. then again he was a conceptual writer and never really paid much attention to his charactes. Its the message that counts not the content...and the message is a warning about big government presented by BB himself."
2,Tha One,this c.d. is off the hook. it blew the sets up down here. everybody need to quit hatin cuz you don't know what's up hot boys can flow and they be tearin up the charts
2,awesome gift,"what more can you say, keeps the coffee in the mug warm. This is a great gift to give people at work."
2,Real music..,I thought it was great...I actually liked every song track on it....What a great person & a wonderful voice...Looking forward to his next Cd....Finally a Cd where I can understand the words & one that I can listen to around anyone!!RLK
1,So what is the sizing?,"I ordered a 3X, because that's the size that the website said to order, it came and lacked about 8 inches closing....so I looked at the package and it says I should have ordered a 5x...seemed extreme, but I exchanged it.I was very impressed with the speed of the exchange, I'll say that....However, when the 5X arrived, it's so big it just gaps and falls off? So, was the 3X mislabeled, or is this 5x mislabeled? I'm needing something with some firm support for post surgery care....so I really don't know what to do at this point?"
2,This was another one of Julie Garwood's great stories,"I have read all of Julie Garwood's book's and I wait eagerly for the next to come out. When I start reading these books, I forget all about my home, husband even my troubles. I love her characters and especially the one's like in ""The Bride"", which is my favorite of her books. But they all are great. She is my favorite author!!!"
1,Unacceptable,"The Eurorack was purchased as a portable mixer to tie mics into a camera. The inherent noise in my particular mixer is completely unacceptable. At a very reasonable level using balanced connections the mixer unmistakably colors the sound with a clear sounding ""HISS"". Even when running on batteries and far away from any electronic device the HISS is incredibly loud! Totally unacceptable for my purpose. The unit is now stashed away in a closet, a washed up waste of time!However for those on a budget who desire much greater quality with fewer inputs I HIGHLY recommend a Mackie 402-VLZ3 Four-Channel Compact Audio Mixer. However sometimes fewer inputs are unacceptable. Whatever the case steer clear from behringer!"
2,Great Swords for a Great Price!,"I ordered the set of swords on December 9th (Sunday) and recieved the swords today (Wednesday, the 12). The Shipping was absolutly BLAZING! UPS Shipped with a Tracking Number made me confident in Sword Demon. Packaging was great and everything was alright. I would deffiently buy from Sword Demon again.These swords are UNSHARPENED. It would appear that Stainless Steel is not very good for sharpening them either. These are really ""Wallhanger"" katana's, But when your buddies come over and see them, they almost cry. These are just the coolest swords because of the movie. All the symbols and words on the blades are actually etched. The symbols and the like are the exact same from the movie."
1,No Table of Contents,"Please be aware before you purchase this Kindle edition that it DOES NOT HAVE A TABLE OF CONTENTS. If you are reading this book for pleasure, starting at the beginning and proceeding directly, this may not be a problem. If, however, like me, you are using it for a course and/or in conjunction with a hard copy edition, this makes it virtually impossible to locate anything in the book or to navigate from chapter to chapter. You have to use successive approximations of the location number every time you want/need to change locations. Consequently, this Kindle edition is useless to me."
1,Far and away the most boring book in the series,"I have every single Ring Of Fire book, and in general, the series is among my favorite sci-fi works. Except for this one. This book is not only almost unrelated to the rest of the series internally, it consists of a series of incredibly inane anecdotes about raising sheep and rabbits. Certainly the dullest sci-fi book I own. The ONLY reason to read this one is because it's referenced from later works, in particular 1635 - The Dreeson Incident. You'd think that a character in a sci-fi novel should have a story at least as interesting as a normal person in real life - and this book sure misses that goal. Unless you're really, really keen on reading short children's stories about anthropomorphic rams (the sheep kind), this book is sure to disappoint.Skip this one - you'll thank me later."
1,jams,"LOVE the size--no complaints there. Rabbit ears hit in just the right spot. But, the beads on mine jammed up after a single use."
2,The part of the book I love is that it's real,"This book is amazing. Like life, there are good things and bad things. I love everything about this book. I love Francie's take on life and how she is portrayed as an intelligent person. I also think it is wonderful how even though Francie may not live the good life, the rich life in terms of possessions and luxuries she has wonderful inner strength, humor, and self confidence. This is a wonderful book and I think that everyone should read this book."
2,Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!,"This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$."
1,A pinhole leak. SERIOUSLY?,"THAT IS CORRECT! After 2 years of light use, I noticed a pool of water on the counter around this miserable piece of garbage.WHY would a piece of STAINLESS steel develop a LEAK? What nonsense.Get something else, anything!!"
2,Great rice maker worth the price!,"Okay - I know the price is high and that's why it took me months to order this rice maker. I have now been using it for about a year and it is one of the best purchases I ever made - worth every penny! It has perfectly cooked everything I have tried (my fav = sticky rice), long grain, short grain, brown, white, sweet, even oatmeal. I use it several times a week and have never had a problem. It still looks and works like the day I bought it. It plays charming little songs to signal the start and end of the program and keeps the rice hot and moist for hours. One tip - don't place the top plate in the dishwasher. I ignored the instructions and put it is the dishwasher - it still works, but it is discolored."
2,Apple travel plugs well made,"I bought the plug package made by Apple for my Mac computer. It is very cleverly made to fit well on the current adaptor and an excellent travel accessory. I only wish that it were priced more reasonably in a package for each area of the world rather than a package for plugs used in many different countries, for a price to equal that package. As I am traveling only in Western continental Europe, I do not need several of the other plugs included, which seems an unecessary expense as well as being wasteful and makes for items I don't need."
2,ended too soon,"Thomas Hardy is a gloomy writer, he likes to end his books by killing off the main characters. In this story he follows the life of a man who good and bad choices in life. You frist meet him as a young married man with a drinking problem. This results in him losing his wife and set him on a path of soberity. Do it yourself AA. When then rejoin his life 20 some years later and watch him self destruct and his wife and daughter reenter his life and he doesn't know how to react. He resumes drinking, Loses his lover, get into a love hate relationship with his presumed daughter. and finally dies of a broken heart as he realizes everything he's lost because of his impulsive behavior. Interesting read."
1,UH OH,"UH OH CLAYMATES!!! Clay's album has fallen out of the top twenty sellers on Amazon.com!!! Quick, better buy ten more copies to get him back up there! Because we all know you can judge the greatness of a record by how many copies get sold. (NOT!)"
1,small didn't work,"It is very small compared to what i thought it would be, but even so it didn't work when we got it"
2,One of the best...,"[...]Thomas Tryon was first a move star...and a very talented and good-looking one at that. I remember him well. ""The Other"", in my opinion, is truly one of the best horror books ever written. It has been some years since I read it...but I've never forgotten Mr's Tryon's ability to truly capture your attention and keep you guessing what was really going on. His artistic ability as an author is not as well-known as should be. He passed away some time ago...Sadly...for who knows what other wonderful works we may have seen by this great writer and talented actor. If you haven't read this one, and you are a horror fan, you should read it. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
2,of mice and men,very pleased with the service and a great book. i had to read it for english many years ago and I fell in love with the story.
2,Sioux History,"Great read...Little Bid Horn battle and the US attempt at geocide with the Native American population in a short, fictional format."
1,Just Kill Me Now,"This was not a very good movie. I had to sheepishly explain to my wife why we had just wasted two hours of our valuable time. I had read some reviews that indicated that this movie was actually worth watching.Nothing could be farther from the truth! This movie was dry and boring the entire way through. And the suprise twist? An alien encounter would have made more sense.And the ending... If a story has to finish with a paragraph explaining or expounding the ending, then there is definitely something wrong. Unless a story is a true story or added for humor, beware of movies that end with a paragraph on the screen. It means that even the writer didn't like the screenplay.The only redeeming factor in this movie is that you get to see Elizabeth Hurley's chest, albeit from the side only.Anybody want to buy a slightly used copy?"
2,Great book for puzzled entrepeneurs!,"I attended a small buisness class at my local community college, this book was used as our text-book. I found it to be very informative and easy to read. The section concerning Business Plan development was very helpful. I recomend this book to anyone trying to find their way through the myrad of information available when starting a small business. The book is very down to earth, in every chapter there are at least 2 real world examples or case studies for the student to compare to his or own experience"
1,"Great book, but not this Kindle edition",There's no question on the importance of Hodge's book. But this $3 Kindle edition is simply scanned with OCR and is almost worthless. It would have been far easier to read it in simple image form.
1,Bill Nichols should not be allowed to write,"Bill Nichols is full of words and empty of thought. You need a machete to slash through the tangled sentences in this book, and what you'll find beneath are simplistic, flawed ideas that aren't developed but buried under more verbiage. Nichols stitches suffixes and prefixes to ordinary nouns, creating monsters like ""situatedness,"" ""hyperrationality,"" ""reconceptualization,"" ""polyvocality,"" ""relationality,"" ""talismanic""(!), and the pseudo-literate's favorite word of all: ""juxtaposition."" Each of those words costs as much time to understand as a whole chapter of Erik Barnouw's book (which is succinct, informative and even humorous). Mr. Nichols should be sealed in a cave and his books slung into outer space, for they pollute the body of film knowledge. Don't buy ""Representing Reality"" unless you want to know how confused Mr. Nichols's reality is."
2,Before you buy...,"I am a believer in many of Glasser's ideas and use his theory within my work. I was so excited to find a new discussion of cases because I had grown so much from <<Reality Therapy In Action>>. I received this book and upon reading the first page realized I was reading something I had read before. This book is the paperback edition of <<Reality Therapy In Action>>. I recommend the book to anyone who desires to be empowered and wants to see where you have more choices than you think. However, if you've read (or like me own) <<Reality Therapy In Action>>, check out something else by Glasser."

1,Fuzzy Logic,Something NOT being disproven[sic] doesn't make it true. Example: You can't prove there isn't a tooth fairy.
1,really cute but..,(I bought the pink nubuck shoes)these shoes are really really cute and they are comfortable BUT i sprayed them with nubuck protectant and thought i would be ok. i wore them and the parking lot was slightly wet with rain and the bottom of the shoe (around the edges of the sole) is REALLY faded. then my jeans touched the back of them and made weird marks on the back and i must have had 1 or 2 raindrops hit them and there are spots. only wear these indoors with no chance of anything touching them besides your feet on the inside of them. i wish they had been leather. i spent the money on them for one night because i wont ever wear them again.
2,Good chick lit!,"This was a very good, fun light read. Very much enjoyed it. Am looking forward to reading more of her books!"
1,Bad customer service and Cheap Printers,"We have had our printer for a little for over a year (also a bit over warranty, of course). We have had a paper feeding issue, so I spent two hours on a phone with someone from India trying to correct the problem. They eventually sent me a new one. Recently, we have had a problem with a big black line through our scanned images. Called again and since it was over a year, they would not help us. AAAH..I will not buy again."
1,Too Much on the Mystical Plate,"The idea behind God was in this Place and I, i did not know it is excellent. Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth-el, and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies. In the process, have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash, unshackled by time. And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored."
2,Short and Sweet,"Great little overview of this amazing missionary's life. It is a very slim vloume at only 128 pages and can be read in an evening. I wept several times while reading it and recommend this book to all. It is a great example of the transformation Christ works in a man. It is a great portrait of a heart that is in fire for Christ and His gospel. It is an excellent introduction to missions and what a missionary must be like. The suffering this man went through will bewilder the mind as the uncompromising passion and dedication to seeing Christ proclaimed challenges the depths of your soul to live every moment as if everything depended on it. Can't say enough about the work God did in this man. This should be required reading for all Christians. As a note, I do plan on getting To the Golden Shore as it goes much more in depth into the life of Judson than this short but inspiring read."
1,A Moment of Zen,"This is supposed to be an artsy movie about the yakuzas and their activities in America. However, it`s not more than an average, empty thriller that`s neither exciting nor funny, let alone creative or original. Takeshi Kitano, who both directs the picture and plays its asian main character, is devoid of charisma while he acts, using the same facial expression the whole time. There are lots of useless moments of pointless violence here, which try to have style and edgyness but fail miserably (Tarantino does it much better). ""Brother"" is a tedious, unengaging waste of time and is quickly forgotten. Meaningless."
2,An Outstanding Read,"An outstanding read about how MacArthur conducted his staff, and how he conducted the entire war. It is interesting because it included first-hand accounts and how the dealings were conducted during this time. MacArthur's communications with the various world leaders offers insights into the how the interactions were conducted, as well as background as to who was invloved and why they occurred. For anyone interested in MacArthur, it is an outstanding book."
2,optimal purchase,great to film in 3D optimal image ferso recommend to anyone who likes the film still in HD. . . .
1,Out-dated views on a chiropractic career.,"Dr. Sportelli has apparently made the decision to provide a very limited view of a chiropractors role. Chiropractic is not about back pain, it is concerned with the removal of interference to the nerve system, thereby allowing the body to function closer to its potential. Chiropractic has never been about ""LOW BACK PAIN""---it is this type of misconception which has permeated our society and continues to be spurred on by texts such as this. Dr. Sportelli graduated from Palmer College of Chiropractic in the 1950's. He most certainly was not taught such nonsense at Palmer, for his pigeon-holed concept is not taught there, nor at any other good chiropractic college. Chiropractic recognizes and deals with the bodies inborn mechanisms. Dr. Sportelli's book was quite a disappointment in this and other respects. My advice, pass this one by and talk to someone at a college such as Palmer, Sherman or Life College and get the facts."
2,Fast and in good shape,It Came to me pretty fast and was in good shape when I opened it. Very happy with it. Thanks
1,Baby is leaking all of the time!,"We used the Pampers Swaddlers (NB and Size 1) prior to these. I ordered these thinking they were the next in the Size 2 line; however, our baby is constantly leaking and smells like pee immediately after a diaper change. We are going to switch back to the swaddlers and hope that solves the issue. They may cost a little more, but hoping they keep our daughter dry. Since she is only 13 pounds, there was no need to move her to size 3 as someone recommended. I would think twice before ordering the Baby Dry."
1,This wallows in lameness!,"The title of the review says it all. The characters are shallow and the situation is contrived. Reading the entire book was painful, and I would not have continued reading it if it wasn't a book club selection. Save your money and your time. Don't bother reading this book!"
1,Pretentious,"""I came to Japan at the invitation of the Japanese Ministry of Education . . ."" indeed! Feiler has a very high opinion of himself. And isn't it a bit inappropriate for a teacher to kiss the hand of a junior high girl, let alone a junior high girl of another culture? I've been reading a lot of Japanese non-fiction and travel essays since a recent visit to Japan and so far this book ranks low in terms of enjoyment, educational value and insight because of its pretentious tone."
1,Pampers leak,I don't often write reviews but I feel I need to. I have twin girls and have found that everytime I use Pampers they leak. The sizing is correct based on the label but they do not absorb enough through the night. I have had to change sheets many times. I do not find this happens with other diapers and Pampers are expensive.
2,Nice,This CD is the epitome of good soundtrack music. You'll get a variety of good music in this album. Definitely recommended.
2,This is an awesome classic book.,"I'm halfway through this book and I found it great. I just can't give up reading this book. Verne is uncomparable. I think it's one of the greatest classic novels by him. I wish I could go on an underwater adventure like this. I brought the version that is translated by anthony bonner. I tempted to buy a different hardcover version which is more costly, but i ordered this edition at last. Translation seems good to me and the book is also well described."
1,Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen,"I thought this was going to be a good movie. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 95%. It's the worst highly rated movie I've ever seen. My girlfriend and I kept saying ""WTF?"" the entire time we watched it. It made very little sense. The Road Warrior is much, much better."
2,"A powerful, moving film you can't stop watching....","even as it races towards its inevitable and forgone conclusion. This movie reached me in a place I didn't even know I had. Jesus Nebot's acting and directing ability should make him an international star. To me the two main characters in this drama are Pablo and Mrs. Knight, the bereaved mother (played by JAG's Susan Haskell in a gut-wrenching performance), forever connected to each other by an accidental tragedy with a cosmic resolution. This movie will stay with you."
2,Gyroscope,The gyroscope was shipped and received very quickly. The product was in excellent condition. Just like the ones I played with when I was younger. My nephew loved it. Thanks.
2,The best book to scare you and your friends,"This book is the best book ive read in my entire life. I love the book because it has scary,funny short stories that will scare you and your friends. And the good thing about it is that it is an enjoyable book not a long boring one about one thing only. And it has really cool pictures with the story so you can know what is happening.It is easy to read and to understand the stories."
2,Boots,"I have an old pair and they are great in the winter and comfortable. SoooooI ordered a second pair for this winter and by the looks at the snow fall yesterday, it was a good choice."
2,inflatable airbed,very happy with this electric pump inflatable airbed - understandable directions -very easy to inflate with electric pump - confortable to lie on especially withheadrest - easy to store with its own bag - I'm entirely satisfied with thisproduct from Amazon
1,Check the facts,"I picked up this book because I was researching my grandfather, who was a B-17 pilot shot down over Switzerland. I looked this up in the book, and immediately found inaccurate information. The author claims that only 10 crews made it to Switzerland in March of 1944, yet when my grandfather was shot down on 18 March 15 other crews were interned by the Swiss on the same day, the highest number in the entire war. The author also claims that many of the bombers landed with little or no damage, insinuating that they were intentionally getting out of the war. This is also false- the AAF conducted an extensive investigation during the war, and found that almost every bomber that landed in Switzerland had extensive damage. I'm not sure where the information in the book came from, but it is incorrect. Any crewman interned in Swizerland could have set the record straight in that regard, and there are plenty of them around who belong to the Swiss Internees Association."
1,If you value your time and money then I'd something else...,"I have owned an HP 940c now for about a year, and as it's now 4AM in the morning and I have a long project to work on, the printer has given me a hardware failure.Having said that I've tried it on different computers, with different cartridges (thought maybe the OS X driver was to blame but evidently not), and it's dead. Now it's 4AM and I've spent 2 hours troubleshooting the printer only to have it dead.To top it off this printer uses the HP #15 cartridge which is a #45 cartridge with half the ink at the same price.. you cannot use a #45 in this printer.I highly reccomend against buying this printer. Not only is it subject to the expensive ink cartridges but it has been widely known for paper feeder problems (a school district recalled theirs), and they are all eventually prone to this sort of failure."
1,Bellydance Magical Motion,"I am a first-timer and it can be rather intimidating to admit for an older woman in her mid-forties! I wanted a video that was decent, and this one surely is. Atea's moves were clear and it helped me to get a good start, but I quickly became bored with it because it lacked FLOW, and I was disappointed that the moves that she so clearly shows do not connect together to form a dance routine. This is what I am looking for. For a beginner to be expected to make a dance out of a bunch of new moves is unrealistic, and I will continue to look for a video that will offer this. If I am to dance like this in front of my husband, (which is mainly why I am learning) I would not be able to show him a routine by learning this video because I am a beginner and don't know how to put the moves together yet. The whole idea is BellyDANCE, and not just Belly EXERCISE, and with the CONFIDENCE I need to dance this way!"
1,"Broke 3rd time out, destroyed back of Prius","We bought this for our Prius only a few months ago, the third time out, the strap broke sometime during our drive and dented the hatch and bumper badly (the bikes hung on til we pulled over). Thousands in damage, don't know if Saris is going to help with the damage but BUYER BEWARE!! 2 adult and one kid bike. Terrible terrible rack."
2,Great CD!,"This is a great cd, showing the traditional side of bluegrass and the direction it is headed! I would highly recommend it."
2,need a good laugh?,"this movies is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. i watched it 3 nights in a row once. some times when i didnt have the best day i watch this because it always makes me laugh. this movie is funny, yet it can touch your heart. its about a girl who lost her short term memory in a car accident and a guy who makes her fall in love with him every day. you gotta see this!"
2,I SPY for younger children,"Shipping was fast and packaging great. I was slightly disappointed that this seemed like an I Spy book for a much younger child than my 8 (almost 9 year old son)..... I wish I had known that ahead of time. Still, a great beginner I spy book, well put together and nice sturdy cover. Thank you."
2,"Interesting, fun and enjoyable.","I discovered this album while exploring music by Mannheim Steamroller and bought it because I am a fan of Mason Williams' ""Classical Gas."" An energetic electronic update to the original acoustic is the first performance on the album, and in my opinion ""Classical Gas 2005"" is every bit as interesting and fun as the original. The remainder of the album varies from hauntingly beautiful (Riding the Low Moon), to epic (The Last Crusade), to western-like (Eddie I'm Ready), to just plain electronic fun (Doot-Doot). The music on this album is too interesting to fade into the background. I find myself being called to stop and listen to its magic. Mason Williams and guitarist Zoe McCulloch make a great team. I'm impressed and pleased with my purchase."
2,This could be the best yet...,"In some ways I think this is Bebel's best album to date. Her music on this album exudes sensuality and sex appeal in a relaxed and mellow way. I am amazed that some fellow reviewers did not feel this from listening to this album. I have counted 2 so-so songs out of the whole entire album. The rest of the album is awesome, hence why I give 4 instead of five stars. Looking back on her other albums I found that there were always a few songs that were just so-so compared to the other songs on the album. She again beautifully fuses electronic and organic elements on this album. She shifts between the slower more intimate songs like ""Close to You"" and ""Night and Day"" to more festive songs like ""Cadaca"" and the great ""Os Novos Yorkinos"" (one of my favorites). All in all I think the songs are well arranged, Bebel's sounds great as always, and you should buy this if you liked her other albums."
1,The Diamond Hunters,"This book is one of Wilbur Smith's early books and it shows.After reading his books set in ancient Egypt, I bought this thinking it would be a good read. He spent too much time on the relationships and too little time on the meat of the story which should have been the search for the elusive diamonds. I was able to finish it but was very disappointed particularly with the ending. It was as if he ran out of steam or got into a hurry. The ending in the book just left you wishing that he would have given you a little more to tie up the loose ends. Not a bad book but, not a great one either."
2,Very sexy,I'm not gay or male but I do enjoy Bob Vickery. His stories always gets my juices flowing. I will definitely read more from him.
2,Grounded For Life,I dont agree with all the views of this book and quickly passed it on. It discusses some valuable advice for new parents of teenagers.
1,New Technology Needs Help,"The Sony eMarker is an awesome idea, but understand that it is nothing more than a stopwatch that depends on data from a website powered by Sony and Broadcast Data. This information seems to need some help, as the ""24 Hour"" wait for playlist updates is sometimes taking 5 days. The product is cool, but Sony needs to keep their end of the deal and update the website... I'd wait for a few months before buying another one so that Sony can iron out the bugs."
1,"Dear Lord, What Happened Here?","It used to be that when artists released a new album, they released a NEW album. Now we get live albums, useless Holiday recordings, and shoddily-made remix releases. This album falls into the third category, and as far as remix albums go, the results are catastrophic. Predictible hip-hop remixes of singles we've heard a zillion times before abound, while the FEW house mixes are as flat as soda left at room temperature for hours. Listen, nobody says you can't do a remix album, but give the listeners some variety and a groove. I actually like Destiny's Child, but after ""The Writing's on the Wall,"" their music is getting more and more vanilla. Should you feel the urge to get this CD, just say ""no, no, no."""
1,Too Pricey!,"We purchased these for awhile because they were the only diapers that would stand up to the ""blowouts"" but let me tell you the Target brand diapers are the same quality for SOOOO much less $ If I had any advice for people getting Pampers or Huggies it would be try Target brand they are the best I promise you won't be disappointed. Don't try Kroger or Kmart brands or anything similar just Target. Only if someone told us this a year ago we'd have a Ferrari by now with all the money we saved after switching!"
2,"Fantastic book! Before you read another book, read this...","This book is short, yet it describes the relationship between our thought, feeling and behavior very correctly. I like the part that our thoughts actually determine our perception and our life. Also, the fact that it is not authored by a star author proves the fact that all of us can have good thoughts and good results, if we put them into practise.AndyTheCoachAsia Coaching TrainingSingapore, Asia"
1,"oh, the politics!!","Mr. DuBois has a reasonable command of the English language and manages to spin a tale that, under different circumstances, might be interesting. However, the unrelenting political thrust of the novel, given life by the sensitive / tough-guy / ex-army protagonist, becomes very quickly annoying. I won't mention which way the author leans - that is unimportant - but will say that the apparent assumption by him that everyone thinks as he does leaves a bad taste in this reader's mouth."
1,no dice,This is a book that serves no purpose i would not read again it does not do wat the title says it is
2,couldn't put it down,"I got this book from the library yesterday and read it cover to cover in 24 hours. It is a wonderful coming-of-age book dealing with loss of innocence, and brings back all the physical and emotional feelings that come with puberty. Family dysfunction is dealt with in typical '60's style -- no over-analyzing or self-pity was allowed then!"
1,LegionnAire,"LegionnAire is really good but there is to much acting in it, it has really good action. Van Damme should stick with doing Katate movies not acting movies"
1,This book has already been written,"Mercedes Lackey contributed to a series I'll refer to as the Merovingian Nights Series, set in a universe invented by C.J. Cherryh. Mercedes's ORIGINAL contribution to the Merovingian Nights series is a far better read. The Shadow of the Lion was a major disappointment to me, not to mention I could have spent my money more wisely on another book. There should have been a warning posted on the cover or flap that if the reader has read the Merovingian Nights series, this book will offer very few surprises. Shame on you Ms. Lackey!"
2,It will transport you to 1940's Paris,I would reccomend this CD to anyone who likes Sidney Bechet. If you're not a fan you will be after hearing this beautiful music.
1,"Obviously, not Adam Sandler's best","An acceptable movie, with some good moments by Adam Sandler, and some of the other new American comedy guys; but very far from his really ""funny people"" involved movies, like ""ANGER MANAGEMENT"" (with Jack Nicholson) or the hilarious ""LITTLE NICKY""."
2,a fabulous sequel,"As sad and tragic as ""Jean de Florette"" (which should be seen first) was, this is a delight, and one of Claude Berri's very best films. Emmanuelle Beart, looking like a wood nymph, is beautiful as Jean's daughter, bent on revenge, and Daniel Auteuil as the lovesick man who's past comes back to haunt him is terrific.Yves Montand is magnificent. This is one of his greatest performances, and shouldn't be missed. His scene with the blind woman is so memorable. I think about that scene often, and of how easy it is to make life changing mistakes by misunderstanding circumstances.The soundtrack by Jean-Claude Petit is lovely, using a theme from Verdi's ""La Forza del Destino"" as its main melody, and the cinematography superb. Best of all, the ending is perfection. Satisfying. A work of art completed."
2,I like this book.,The book Castle in the Attic is a good book.My favorite part is when william defeated Alastor. There was one other good part in Castle in the Attic. When William was trying to get to Alastors kingdom and the dragon was distracting him with bad visions. I recommend this book to anybody who likes exciting books.
1,barely cosi cosi (so so),"This might be an ok movie to watch on a weekend when you're bored and have absolutely nothing better to do. Of course it's nothing like the book. It's terribly contrived with some very unlikely scenes. For example, there's this one scene where the long-haired Chinese man that shows up for an extended visit after his girlfriend dumps him actually gives birth. That just can't happen in real life!! Guys can't get pregant (yet)!! Anyway, forget about the movie. Read the book."
2,Great for the money,"The picture on this camera is good and it needs very little light. However, the colors are not quite as accurate as I had hoped for Hi8. Perhaps digital would have been better, but the price was a factor. I shopped around and found Amazon had the best price available."
1,False advertising,"Received the correct box, which was damaged as noted in item description, however, the cake dome was not the item pictured and not the item in the product description. It was a very used dome from a different manufacturer and very different style (black and handpainted). Diasppointed as the savings for this particular item was significant when compared to a new one when I took the sellers word as in the product description aned photos."
1,Pamper lover sadly disappointed by this version,"I have been using pampers swaddlers with dry max since my twins were born and love them! I can count on 1 hand the number of ""blow outs"" and leaks. I use subscribe and save and my item was unavailable for the previous purchase price. I decided to try these. I thought they also had dry max since they said baby dry. I am now having at least one leaky diaper every morning and have had 3 diapers I had to throw away because the tabs tore. This has never happened. My twins are one and in size 3 diapers. I have tried the cruisers which seem to be ok. I'm not sure if it is just the lot I have or this line of diapers. I may have to go back to the cruisers since the swaddlers are not made in large sizes."
1,Great For First Timers,"While the flexability is nice this uses non standard triple a batteries which is uncommon for most vibrators. Size is actually a little small and no twisting inside, I would recommend this to ladies who like it small or first timers."
1,New Design Leaks,"Loved the old design - my baby stayed dry through the night. Now, every morning he is soaked. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I didn't mind paying a premium price for the old design - it was phenomenal. The new design does not compare. I have switched to Luvs."
2,Good product nonetheless,"I just had one problem with the delivery wherein one bottle (soft wash gel) leaked but this was replaced immediately. I'm very pleased with the ease of use and results produced by the cleaner wax, quik detailer and quik interior detailer. The only thing to make this better is they add one or two micro fiber towels. Got this for $20 a few months ago."
2,This is a very good hardcore band/CD,"Hatebreed isn't a modern ""sell-out"" wannabe hardcore band. These guys are alsome and i suggest them to any hc fan..."
2,Barbie as Rapunzel: A Creative Adventure,"I purchased this software for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much. She lets me play it sometimes, but she doesn't always like what I come up with. I plan to purchase other software programs for her."
1,until you've walked in my shoes,"As a father of a daughter with autism, i was surprised by how little time the author contributed to the family life. More time was spent at work and then writing a book when it sounds like home would have been the place to be at this critical time for his family. He writes often about don't critize until you've walked in my shoes yet he has no problems bashing the GFCF diet which has proved helpful to many families. while written with great love for his son, i am not sure his priorities are in order."
2,"Wonderful, wonderful","Thank you, Erika Vause, for your positive review! I absolutely love this book! I had heard of this novel, but never considered reading it because the plot simply did not interest me. Then we read it in our academic English class (10th graders) and I was absolutely astonished!! Not only by the magnificence of the book--its themes of guilt and redemption are powerful and heart wrenching--but by the ignorance of some of my peers. It was obvious that their dislike sprung from the fact that they did not understand it! Please, please--read this book! You will not be sorry! I promise."
2,A lovely Little Book on the the Importance of Simplicity in Life,"This is a lovely little book. It is filled with contemplations on the importance of simplicity and balance in one's life.A busy woman who has focused her life on success becomes enamored of Amish quilts. Her admiration is so great that she takes time out from her life to go and live with the Amish. There, she reflects on her own values and comes to realize that the act of doing is as important as the outcome. She also realizes that being a part of something, rather than standing out from others, is a more cooperative and giving way to live.How the author juxtaposes the meaning of things with the sentiment reflected in the quilts is very lovely and meaningful.I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever had questions about what is important in life and their own core values."
1,Disappointing and too simplistic,"This minimalism style of writing exposes too much reliance on characters and events from previous books with little descriptive detail of some promising locations. The action is thin as well, characters die frequently and quickly with little build up or detail. Character motivation is weak at times and contributes to an arid experience with a predictable climax."
2,a major classic,i felt i had to put my two cents in. I read this book several years ago and still remember the magical way the story unfolded. Do Not Miss Out. You will long remember a place and people who existed in Gabe's wonderful imagination. The book is a rare gift of words.
2,Really pretty,"I bought this for myself, and I really like it. The heart and key are very pretty, and as long as you keep it clean, there is a nice sparkle to it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the chain it comes with. It is very thin and easily tangles. I ended up ordering a new thicker chain for it, and now it's perfect."
2,hi-tec mens altitude IV,"great boots even works great while walking up wet boards!!! buy this product you will not be sorry, well made and true to size."
2,Rice Cooker,"This is an AMAZING product! It makes PERFECT rice every time, never sticks to the pot and is amazingly easy cleanup! I would HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone!"
1,"The book is very boring and in some parts,doesn't make sense","This book just plain doesn't make sense and it doesn't apply to younger people. Even though many schools have made this book a standard for 9th and 10th graders to read, many of us just don't understand and get lost. We understand about censorship and all that other stuff, but why are you telling us? We are the ones that want to make everything more open. You make us read this book, like we are the ones trying to close everything up and prevent us from reading anything. I think the congress men and all adults should read this. Not kids. I personally think that teachers and educators could have picked a better book for us students to read. But that is my opinion, and suprisely many fellow students agree with me."
2,It's 1984 All Over Again!,"The A-Team are back in this terrific assemblance of music from the TV score. From the opening theme, to the A-Team in New York City, and right through the closing theme you cannot help but visualize Hannibal, Face Man, B.A. & Howling Mad Murdock either eluding, chasing, fighting or rescuing someone. If you appreciated the shows music back in the 80's - ""you ain't heard nothing yet!"" until you've heard it on digital disc. An absolute must for all true fans of the A-Team"
2,ORDOR GONE,"This is a great product for a caregiver, as I am. The product gets rid of urine ordors in laundry basket and in air. I just love it."
2,Only disposable that's ever worked for us!,"I mostly use cloth diapers during the day, but for overnight and going out, I go with disposables. We're on our 3rd baby now, and over the years Pampers has been the ONLY disposable diaper that we can rely on! Have tried cheaper brands sometimes - they're cheaper for a reason! Pampers has consistently given us a diaper that we can count on not leaking. Store brands, Luvs, Huggies have all failed us multiple times, just leak really bad or tear easily. I am rarely brand-loyal, but Pampers is now the only brand of disposable I'll buy. Pampers is a good quality disposable for the times that you need it (I still recommend using mostly cloth and more natural products though!)"
2,This is how you start things off,What can I say that hasn't been said. This first movie of the trilogy is great. Great effort was made to really explore the Batman psyche. They explore what and how does a man become Batman. I don't think you saw Bruce Wayne in the Batman costume in the first 30 minutes of the movie. This more than made up for the previous Batman movies. As a Dark Knight fan I loved this movie.
2,death du jour,I liked it. I'm trying to get all of the collection. These books keep me entertained when im passing time.
1,Extremely Disappointed with this video,"I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know."
2,Great old school Toby,This box set is a must for people that love Toby Keith's old school music.It's got his first three albums.This is back when Toby Keith had some REALLY good songs out.I'm not much into his newer stuff at all.It sounds nothing like this.Buy this if you're a fan of his earlier music like I am.
1,A unique torture-technique,"I saw COYOTE UGLY on an airplane from Germany to the United States three times, in English, in French, and in German. By the third screening, I wanted the plane to crash.Without a shred of revealed flesh, the film teases, tantalizes, and seduces without ever gratifying. There is nary a thong in this picture!This is eroticism without the eroticism.It's a bit like a soft-core film made for Nickelodeon."
2,Perfect for me,I like itI was looking for it I found it I got and I am enjoying it to the fullestI recommend it to anyone
1,"Maybe Big Brother will hate me, but...","I think this is one of the most overrated books I've ever read.The idea of it and the detail put into it is admirable, but it lacks that special 'something' that can make such serious/scary subject-matter hold my attention.I can understand the importance of the story, but Winston Smith wasn't a character I cared for or found any interest in whatsoever. And although the boook made me dislike Big Brother and The Party--the fact that the proles and even the disagreeing members of the Party didn't care enough to attempt an uprising meant that I really didn't care about any of them."
1,"Doesn't scan, doesn't print!","I agree with the others here, HP are useless and I should have known better. Paper jams all the time using laser quality paper kept in a humidity controlled environment. Every copy you have to feed through manually.I couldjust about live with that but it doesn't scan either!! It says it'sscanning, it sounds like it's scanning - it even says image sent to the computer after scanning but do any images appear?? Do they heck!! Still under warranty, I've had a replacement unit and still the same and the HP techie team, (based in India!) can't help - it's going back!!"
2,Love pampers!,"Pampers is awesome, my baby girl has never had a rash since day 1 and she is almost 7 months now. This baby-dry theme is also very true because it holds a lot with out giving her any redness. Also, since its now flexible on the legs, its even much better for my baby girl to move around with it. In addition, I do highly recommend to subscribe to the amazon subscribe and save program. I don't have to worry about carrying a big box of pampers at the store, especially all the room it took on my grocey cart!! and at the same time watching my daughter. Now I get it delivered to my door, monthly, with free shipping and at a great price, ..WHAT MORE CAN I ASK FOR?? I highly recommend this service and PAMPERS... its the best!"
2,Spey Flyes,"A wonderful history of the major patterns. Colour plates with most of the patterns as well. If you want to fish the traditional spey, this si a book to have!!"
1,Defective c/d's,"What a disappointment. I was thrilled that Amazon carried this 2-set c/d, but when it arrived it was ""unplayable"". With it's usual efficiency Amazon provided a return label, and I re-ordered the product. The replacement too was unplayable. Obviously a manufacturing error. While I was very disappointed with the product, it renewed my confidence in Amazon to stand by their customer refund policy. This is why I buy everything I can through Amazon. You can't find a better guarantee on the internet, or anywhere else. Thanks Amazon."
1,Cannot Recommend It,"This product has only one thing going for it. It's nice looking. Besides that, it's totally worthless. Cheaply made. Almost impossible to remove without either dropping it or having your fingers slip off of it which usually results in your fingernails scraping across the surface of your lens or lens filter. After 10 drops and 4 fingernail scrapes, I ordered the following product.Mennon Pro Center Pinch 67mm Snap-On Lens Cap with Leash. It's much better. Sturdily made, snaps off and on very easily, same price as the Canon. Only drawback - no nice Canon logo."
2,classic,"most underrated rap group, when lil wayne actually talked real s*** besides aliens and skateboards..if u like lil Wayne u should deffinetly love this album"
1,"Fine for children, boring for adults","One has to be a young adult to enjoy this book. If you want to read about children in a foreign country without adult supervision, well, there you have it. I'm surprised it wasn't turned into a Disney movie.Definitely a children's book."
2,wonderful jazz,"One of the most wonderful jazz CD's I've purchased in the last few years. Ms. McRae takes the genius of Monk, removes the edginess without detracting from the spirit of the music, and rolls out knock-out after knock-out. I wouldn't have thought it possible, frankly. The supporting quartet is terrific. I can't imagine any true jazz lover being disappointed in this CD."
1,Worst dating book ever,"This is the worst dating book ever for catholics. The author believes that dating should be mechanical and leaves little space for God's grace and healing.And you are to kiss once you get married not before. Perhaps it's an american custom as the author is american. Avoid at all costs, it was a waste of money. Better get 'The Question' rather than this book."
1,Annoying and condescending,"My husband and I couldn't fit a birthing class into our schedule, so upon reviewing our options we decided to buy this dvd. Being that we are a couple with a great sense of humor, and don't like to take anything too seriously, ""laugh and learn"" sounded like the right choice. Honestly, we both found this woman-Ms. Bayles- to be extremely annoying with her stories and condescending atttude. She constantly made fun of the people she was talking about...especially the men. We were expecting a nice take it easy approach to lamaze, but we found ourselves rolling our eyes at every digression. Although, I have to say that she is quite knowledgeable and if she would stick to the facts and not try so hard to be funny, this would be a worthwhile dvd. By the way, I never write reviews, ever."
2,Just Marvelous,"Wow, Madonna did such a wonderful job with this. I haven't heard any of the other recordings, but Madonna had real EMOTION in her voice. I have the single-cd copy, and I'm thinking about going and buying the double one, just because it's that good. I definitely reccommend this if you're into musicals. Even if you aren't a Madonna fan, it's worth it."
1,very bad quality!!!!!,This blu ray is horrible!!!The quality video is terrible!! is better an old whs!!!
2,I Loved the Story if nothing else,"I thought that honoring Audrey Hepburn was a wonderful idea and ever since I found out about the special, I had wanted to see it. Although, in the beginning, I did not particularly like Hewitt's interpretation of Audrey, after I watched it a few more times, her performance grew on me. I now find myself watching the tape weekend after weekend, hanging on her every word, waiting to see what happens next.(even though I have it memorized.) The story is amazing with all the different love struggles that she goes through. My favorite moments are all her proposals and break ups. I think that anyone who likes a good Romantic flick would love this movie. It is definately worth the watching."
1,Be aware!,This cd does not work for a european cd player!They should have warned me when buying from Europe.I am not satisfied with it.
2,Dated but still very good,"I haven't sat down to watch the movie yet, but I thought I would take another look at the source material.Well, it is still a great book. The only thing is that it has been ripped off by so many other franchises.The only problem with the book is Burroughs insistence on creating as many alien races as he can. The amount often becomes bewildering, and this is a problem that a lot of his other work had. I remember becoming lost when reading the people that time forgot - there seemed to be so many creatures and races, that I couldn't keep up.Still, there is a lot to admire in this book, and you will be very entertained by it."
1,A bit disappointing,"It would seem that the last batch of books produced by the Asimov aren't quite what they use to be. I'm still and always will be an avid fan, but the last two books in the foundation series were a bit of a let down. Though Foundation Forward (in the timeline between Prelude to Foundation and Foundataion) was relatively the best of his last 3.-chris"
1,Not good with long sleeves - doesn't stay in the right place,"Futuro makes another version that is like a compression sleeve that extends above and below the elbow and has two forearm pressure points. I find it to be much easier to use. This one goes on fine, then slides down frequently. If I try pulling my sleeve up and adjusting it, it slides down again when I try to get the sleeve back down over it. If you might be using this while wearing long sleeves, or you don't want to have to make adjustments throughout the day, I recommend checking out the other version that just says ""Elbow"" and not this sport version."
2,Best baby book I've found,This is HARD to find. There is a newer version very similar to this and is NOT as good. It has too many biblical references for my taste and the general illustrations are not as good. This is the one to have. Great shower gift.
1,"Great player, bad job with the refurbish","We bought this player for my mother, as I have the same one and love it. But, this player had problems from the get go, being a refurbished model. Sansa support was good, but their fix for the problem only lasted a matter of hours. We eventually had to return it, which was a fast and painless process with Amazon.The player, when it works correctly is great. I can't even begin to fill mine up with songs, videos and recordings. The FM recorder is great for lectures, conventions and other occasions. The sound quality is amazing. I also love that, unlike the e200 series you can format and also erase songs directly on the player without using your computer. It also conveniently has a spot for audiobooks and podcasts. Also to note that you can download shows and movies from amazon to play on this player.It was tough giving a star rating as this particular player was broken, but knowing from experience that they can make wonderful mp3 players."
2,Wonderful read and true to the experience,"During travels to the Explorama Lodges twice, I was able to see what Dr. Smith has been able to accomplish. She is a marvelously dedicated individual. This books is a diary of her experiences, but after having visited the area, I was also able to have similar experiences from a tourist perspective. Dr. Smith, who I have met and talked to is a creative, stong and full person, dedicated to make a difference for the people in this area of the Amazon. She has done that and the book tells her story."
2,Great Christmas Classic,"I used to watch ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" every year as a child and now my kids love to watch it. Even now, I'll sit and watch it with them-anytime of year. More importantly, this Christmas story emphasizes the true meaning of Christmas-something I'm happy to have my children watching."
1,wrong size,heard converse shoes were hard to size up. wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now. oh well not ur fault
1,"It's not new, it's used","It arrived in an amazon box with cushion. Inside the perfume box was beat up and covered in something sticky. Oh, and about 25% of the perfume was already used."
1,I hate it.,"Terrible book. I'm not into classics, so if you're like me, don't buy it. If you like them, buy it."
1,Very stupid,"Very stupid adaptation of the DC horror comic book not only lacks brains but also a lacks an actor who can pull off the complex role of John Constantine. Keanu Revees is gravely miscast as John Constantine, which is a shame because Reeves could have pulled off the role but with a screenplay that is so badly written, Keanu does not come out looking good at all and makes an complete fool out of himself in the process. Only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou manages to pull though this mess with their dignity intact and that's manly because they bring far too much acting talent to this badly made film. I suggest you see it for Weisz and Hounsou because they are the only good things about this bad movie."
2,Really calms my dog down.,"I have two dogs. A Jack Russell which has become very aggressive lately towards my other dog, a Pug.I needed something to calm him down. I tried this and it really works.I could tell because I could see the difference in him when It ran out and I went a week before getting a refill.It might not work for your dog, but it's worth a try."
1,Crazy in Alabama,I ordered this movie and another as region 2 not understandin what that meant. When I received the movie it would not work and I could not figure out why. I emailed Movie Mars they explained but since it ws my fault it was not worth returning. I think they should make a side caption for region two explaining it. If I would have known what it was I would not have ordered it. These were a Birthday gift. I had to reorder the right region so I had to wait and give the gift late. Plus I just threw away the othe movies!
1,A harlequin romance for the new age,"OK. I picked this up as a light weekend read, not expecting ""War and Peace"" but something fun.This book was as trite as a 1970s Harlequin romance. By the end of the first chapter, I had predicted the character development and plot twists to the very last page. The characters were horribly stereotypical and one-dimenensional. The ""nice girl"", the evil vengenful ""psycho-girl"", the ""I've having an affair with a married man and want some permanence in my life, girl"", the ""torn between job vs family girl""..I could go on forever...The only thing that kept me reading to the end was to find out if my predictions panned out.Also any author who uses the word ""frission"" twice in 10 pages should be locked in a room and required to read Strunk's ""Elements of Style"" until they learn to write beyond a 10 grade level.All in all a waste of my time and the author's."
2,Sweet Read!,"Jim the Boy by Tony Earley is a sweet novel set in North Carolina during the late 1920's. Unlike other books set in the South of recent memory, though, this book doesn't describe an abused young man or a dysfunctional family but rather one of great strength.Although Jim's father dies only a matter of days before he was born, Jim is raised by his mother and three uncles who never married. Throughout the book, it is these men, who earn their livelihood from farming, who teach Jim some of life's greatest lessons. From learning how to hoe a field to confronting a firends devestating illness to seeing the grandfather he never knew as this old man lays dying, we as readers journey along as Jim experiences life between his tenth and eleventh birthday.Reminiscent of the equally lyrical style found in Plainsong by Kent Haruf, this book is a pleasant read for a summer's day."
2,Just as good as any diaper,"After 5 kids, we used all kinds of diapers. While some store brands were less than expected, Pampers, Huggies, and Luvs were the ones that performed the best. As long as it holds in what it's supposed to hold in, I could care less what they looked like!"
1,Nothing New,"This is nothing new from Gail Howard, or at all. These wheeling systems can be worked out mathematically, without paying for this book. There are also lots of websites that offer number generators and wheeling system explanations for free. If you want it all spelled out for you then buy this book, but if you are willing to do a little mathematical work check out lottery information website like [...]."
2,"Smooth and cool, like the anime series!","This CD is hi-tech and sharp and jazzy. It reflects the genre of the Cowboy Bebop anime series, and all but one part of the first song (where we hear the opening theme song) are all original material. The dj (who speaks between songs) is odd, but kind of funny -- talking about old bands from the 2040s and cracks about Jabba the Hutt. If you enjoy smooth and tasteful lounge, as well as some danceable trance/ambient tunes this is probably an excellent buy for you. You might want to check your anime shop, before plunking down 30 bucks for it, but it will still be cash well spent."
1,"It only remembers the time, not the station.","Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a ..clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you"
1,Repeated phrases are annoying.,"This book series gets annoying. Every character in the book is a whining sissy. The author repeats a few phrases more times than I would like to read. The lack of creative writing along with the characters whining, irritates me. If you like zombie novels were everyone sits around and sobs about how pathetic and confused they are. Then this is your novel. This book is bad, but it has some good qualities. The second book (the city), however, is just more of the same and worse. I'm 100 pages into The City, and I feel like a chump for giving this publisher more of my money. In both books there has been the introduction of more than a hundred characters, and out of all of them not one is going on a zombie killing rampage.Autumn doesn't compare to other great zombie adventures like Day By Day Armageddon or Tooth and Nail.This is one story that isn't worth the time or money."
1,missing instruction,"I used this product over the weekend and having problems with my eyes it was hard to read the back label. The company not including that normal one page instruction made it very difficult for me. In that case, I could have purchased similar item at Walmart and it would have been cheaper for me to return it if I was not satisfied. I would have sent this item back. However,shipping cost was too much."
1,"Junk,Don't wast your money.","I got these in hope It would give me a good fit to my jawbone 2, but they did not work for me. I think they even made it less of a fit."
2,Life changing book,This book changed my life for the better period. It's a must read book for anyone struggling through this life. I'm in the process of purchasing all of Don Miguel Ruiz's books.
2,"Perfect Rice, Everytime","I have had this for nearing a year now, and I have been eating perfect rice for nearing a year now. The song this plays when it starts and finishes is like something out of one's childhood, but it makes no difference. For people who want something done right, you already know Zojirushi is the way to go. I am glad I got the smaller model. This makes perfect servings for up to four - six persons. It also has tons of options and comes with a recipe book. (You can make paella, but it's not the best paella) It also makes tasty rice pudding. Possibly my best purchase of 2007."
2,An awesome cd,This cd is an eclectic mix of all different types of songs. One of the most original albums I've listened to.
1,Ok but nothing great,Its not a bad book but I expected more. I didnt find myself locked into it waiting for the next thing to happen and unable to put it down. One thing I didnt like is the chapters are tiny. It doesnt really let you get into one part of the story before its switched to another. I think they did this to imply fast action and keep you always expecting the next thing but it didnt work for me. I wont buy the next book in the series.
1,Do not buy! Be aware of cheap plastic!,These were way to expensive and I cannot believe that I bought these. You might as well as get a piece of tape and try to use that. It will be just as effective. Which means not at all. go with sally hansens. do not buy from here.
1,Not a good measurement,Mark of fitness MF-180 did not work. It did not pick my heart rate accurately no matter how many times I repositioned it. It was also uncomfortable. I do not recommend this for anyone who needs a reliable heart rate reading.
2,Love these diapers,"I absolutely love these diapers. I used a big box of Huggies previously and we were cleaning up poopie messes almost daily. My baby has only had about 5 accidents in the past month with these. They do keep him very dry and not soaked if there is a lot of pee. My baby is very chunky and short, so I have to disagree with a previous review that chunky babies do better with Huggies. These are hands down the best diapers I've used so far."
2,"If this doesn't get you dancing, you have no pulse!","The single, ""Galang"" explodes like computerized firebombs! All quaking synths and bells and whistles and a beat that would get the dead to dance. Those who are expecting more run-of-the-mill ""crunky"" R&B can look elsewhere for that dreck. The album's combination of dancehall, Brazilian funk, grime and house with M.I.A.'s chirpy, sexy raps is hands down one of the best albums of the year. Own it now!!!"
1,Horrible!,"No preservatives, no MSG, also NO flavor, and NO spice! It was like eating plain ramen without any seasoning at all. If you're a vegan and you're looking for vegan snack foods, look somewhere else. This isn't worth the money."
2,one of the top comics in the world,He is so talented and expressive with his face. I love his humor that is relatively clean but so dead on true.
2,"An easy, fair & refreshing read!","The Greatest Generation is an easy read yet it's also even handed and fair. I agree with Brokaw's point that those who went to war (pacific or europe) are the generation that built America and modernized it. The generation which offered its unconditional love and service to the United States and ran to her aid when she needed them. This generation (now in their late 70s or 80s) came home from the front lines and contributed to the re-construction of a country that suffered from the New Deal, Great Depression and other problems of the 1930s. This book attests to the greatness of that generation and should be on every young man's reading list."
1,Bad band,The band was far too thin and would roll down my leg continuously. I returned all pairs I bought for a refund. Very disappointing for a Jobst product.
2,keeps my coffee just right,"I bought this because my coffee at work was always getting cold, fast. It doesn't overheat if you leave it on (I've accidentally left it on over night) and keeps the temperature of the coffee just right."
1,Poopy!,"Not scary, bad acting, boring story... One star added for some nifty special effects. I really wanted to like this movie, but alas, it was another ""Armageddon."""
2,Great value.,This set incorporates a lot of the favorites from other sets packaged in an A to Z learning format. I have been leary of purchasing too many of these blocks for storage reasons so the zippered case is a great bonus. Definitely worth every penny.
1,Died after 4 months and tech support is horrible...,"I read the reviews before purchasing this adapter, and I guess I simply got a dud. That happens, but the tech support is horrible. The support staff was very unhelpful and told me it would take weeks to replace.The other adapter replacements don't seem much better, given the poor reviews for Kensington's model.Just hope you don't get a dud."
1,Can this BE any more wrong?,"As a huge Audrey fan I was disgusted to see that Jennifer Love Hewit was cast to play Audrey in a biopic. Not only does JLH not resemble Audrey in any way but JLH can't act at all, in any fashion. I see this as just another chance for JLH to be overexposed as something she is not (i.e. actress, singer.) If you buy this i recomend burning it when your done."
1,Of Mice and Men,"This book is about two hobos named George and Lennie. In the beginning of the story they are on their way to a ranch to earn a stake. When they get to the ranch they meet Candy, the one handed man, Slim the team leader, Curly the bosses son, and Curly's wife. Curly is always loosen his wife and can't find her. She tries to flurred with all the guy at the ranch. Lennie is in the barn petting his dead puppy when she comes to flurred and then something happens! You'll have to read the book to find out what happens."
2,great material for children,This is a great video for children to learn the stories of the bible at a level the can relate to and in a way they can enjoy. I feel the spanish transaltions are great and accurate. My son even at 8 months enjoys it and is learning not only spanish but the word of God!!
1,Incomplete,"Nice idea, poor execution. It simply does not work well, and is therefore much more trouble than it's worth."
2,size of mugs,"The mugs are very nice, but I guess I didn't think of the 16 oz. size, as a result they are much larger than I would have liked them...other than that they are very nice and will be put to use..."
2,Perfect for my pickup.,I have a S10 pickup with a topper and my options for a bike rack were limited. This is perfect. It's a little labor intensive to put on and take off but it works... it works well... and I'm very happy with it.
2,A Frankenstein for our Generation,"This is my first Dean Koontz novel and it will surely not be my last.Frankenstein, Book one: Prodigal Son is a refreshing tale of what happens when the man becomes the monster and the monster becomes the man. Mix that in with a few serial killers, clones and a unlikely partenrship. Think James Paterson meets Mary Shelly.Already on Book 2 can't wait to see what happens next."
2,"Guide to Owning a Burmese Cat: Feeding, Grooming, Health, Handling, Exhibition","This book is a great starters guide to owning and basic understanding of the history of Burmese cats. Useful basic information on care, feeding and breeding."
2,Great,Great American classic that you can get for free on kindle. I was supposed to read this back in high school but wasn't not interested at the time. But now with the benefit of age I can really appreciate it.
2,Get Shirty!,"I am a guy who wears formal shirt and tie to my office, so I have lots of shirts and I know a good shirt when I wear it.This was my first purchase of a Bill Blass Dress Shirt, so I did not quite know what to expect.Well I have now worn it a few times and it has been laundered and ironed and is still holding up well.I would recommend this shirt which I bought at an excellent price in a recent Amazon sale."
2,"Works great, easy to setup","Couldn't be any happier with how this functions, and the setup was as simple as it gets."
1,Offensive,"I'm a white female who is married to a black man. I'm outraged that she does not agree with interracial marriages. She talks about living in AmeriKKA, but it is her as well who promotes racist views. How are we to live as a nation if people can't be friends/lovers just because of their colour. Obviously we haven't progressed as a nation if we can't accomplish that."
1,Are you kidding me?,"First of all, the information in the DVD is very informative but for $50 buck I figured it would show something more than a lady standing in front of a black curtain holding up the same anatomy pictures that are on my doctors wall. I love how she simulates labor by pushing a doll out of a wool hat....It was so realistic. I sat there thinking,'are you kidding me?' Sheri, the instructor, knows what she is talking about but is extremely annoying and shares a lengthy personal story for every point. For every 10 min of information, you get 20 minutes of insight into her personal life. I would pull my hair out and ask for general anestesia if she was my labor nurse."
1,For whom the bell tolls--for fans of thier back catalogue,"This single, and most likely (though it saddens me to say it) the album from which it originates [Always Outmanned...], is dissapointing. This statement is only for those who love Experience and feel that the Prodigy peaked with Music For the Gilted Generation--folks who were introduced to the Prodigy via Fat of the Land will probably love it. It's got plenty of ...slurred ""singing"" by Keith Flint and mediocre beats that compliment it very well. I've been waiting many years for signs of a return to the powerful, compelling, and complex beats of old, and it looks like I might have to just give up. My catalogue of 15+ Prodigy lps and eps might not be getting any new friends any time soon."
2,Wonderful,It just helps to have God's word there for you in the area or topic you need to focus on. Very helpful and easy to use.
1,Dececptive seller,"When I bought this book, I expected the book displayed with the same cover. Instead I got a worn out scribbled on book for my mother's birthday. The seller of this product didn't display the real cover or the actual condition of the book. Like New? I think not."
1,boxers,"No I won't purchase Hanes Boxers again. I don't like the seams in them, and they ended up as clean up rags in the garage."
1,Ha Ha Ha,"Why is she not famous? I agree with the other smart reviewer, because she STINKS! Wow does she stink! I had no choice but to throw her CD in the trash. I wasn't going to torture anyone by giving them this CD as a present! No way! I just THREW IT AWAY!"
1,Wait for the new edition !,"While this book on nutritional biochemistry was adequate when it came out in 1999, much has changed in seven years. Without an update of the way daily allowances are now determined, new findings in the area of molecular biology, etc. the potential buyer may be rewarded by waiting for the next edition. It is interesting to note that most of the reviews came from the author."
1,"Almost All Fighting, Next to No Interesting Dialogue","This movie is essentially a 2-hour fight scene with about 20 minutes of half-interesting dialogue and story sprinkled in. Terribly violent and uninteresting. Honestly the most fighting I have ever seen in any movie (including Matrix Reloaded). I wholly regret the $1.99 I spent to rent it. Unless you want to see endless stabbings and blunt force traumas, do not see this movie."
1,Mullets across the Med,"I don't see why the producers bothered making this movie. It adds nothing to the Kirk Douglas version of Ulysses made in 1955, besides a few limited CGI effects. Even Douglas's beard was preferable to Assante's mullet hairstyle in this version. This has stripped out all of the sex and most of the violence that is in the original Homer.What we have here is a TV movie made in 4x3 format back in 1997, but finally released on DVD in 2004 to cash in on the 'TROY' blockbuster. It was made to be acceptable to the US TV market, but I suspect the production team was European.To my knowledge, there has yet to be a good film/TV adaptation of the Odyssey. The best dramatisation so far is a recent audiobook dramatisation by the BBC starring Tim McInerney."
2,Good Read,"I have read this book more than once, when I first read it I had to for school but really enjoyed it. I read it again and even watched the movie, the book is way better. Very good message for those that think books are bad and useless. Books remind us of the past and can help us in our day to day lives."
2,Great Buy,"I'm really impressed by this 4 CD collection. Apart from his last 1952 the CD's covers Hank Williams' entire career. hough it's slightly frustrating having to look out for his last recordings somewhere else, this is really a great buy. The sound surprisingly good, even the radio acetates from his Health and Happiness shows sound good, and it's very interesting to experience a little of how Williams was a a live performer. The 52 pages booklet contains a detailed biography and a lot of information about Hank's sessions and recordings.Highly recommended"
1,A PRINCESS OF MARS,I ENJOYED THE BOOK VERY MUCH. IT WAS WELL SPACED AND EASY FOR AN ELDERLY PERSON TO READ. THE ONLY FAULT I FIND IS I THOUGHT I WOULD RECEIVE THE DUST COVER AS SHOWN IN THE ADD.I TRIED TO BE CAREFUL IN READING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BOOK AND WAS SURE THAT IT CAME AS IT WAS PICTURED IN THE ADD.
1,Ok at best,"I didn't make it half way through the book before I gave up on it. It just seemed to go on and on and on.... I usually like Mercedes Lackey, but every once in a while, she makes a bobble, and this was one of them. I think the book whould have been a lot better as either two books or one greatly pared down book."
1,I only gave it a star because I had to.,"This was the worst book I ever read. I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence. You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness, but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life. It's no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic, he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book. If you are a high school student,like I am, you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again. And to you who have no read this book, don't. You have not, or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Oh, and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book, there is nothing romantic about this novel, nor anything good. If you are in the mood for a good romance shoot for Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown, they can actually write!"
1,Worst Quality,I wore this shirt just once. It's almost transparent. Not worth it even if you get it for free.
1,A peculiarity from Poverty Row.,"The oddities of this Monogram semi-horror film begin with the title! The ""ghost"" in question is NOT invisible, and is not really a ghost. Also, the shadow of an ape appears on the main title card. (Don't ask me, I'm only the reviewer.) The various plot twists contain no supernatural or science fiction elements, and yet are even less plausible than those of other Monogram horrors. The director, Joseph Lewis, displays almost none of the talent he showed in his later films. Only the presence of Bela Lugosi makes this one worthwhile. The role of ""Dr. Kessler"" is a Jekyll/Hyde character, so Lugosi is playing a normal, likeable guy during most of his screen time, which makes this one of his more unusual roles. Also, Clarence Muse is good as the butler."
1,Mirror came damaged and late,After contacting the seller about the item never being received a second was shipped. When we got it the mirror itself had fallen out of the housing. We didn't want to wait an additional month to get a replacement so we glued the mirror back on the housing.
2,glider,"the glider got here much sooner than I thought, it arrived in great shape and all the pieces were there. I put it together by myself even if the kept saying 2 people. It was not hard and directions were simple.. It's really nice"
2,Great Christian fiction,Lynn Austin beautifully combined the historical facts of Hezekiah's reign with her imagination of how one event may have led to the other. I was constantly looking at my Bible to be sure the scripture references were correct; they were!
1,Terrible design,I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear. The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear. They seem to be made of a very thick silicone that has a slightly slippery feel to them. I was really disappointed with these. Stay away if you have small ear canals.
1,Double Shuffle,"When on a dark, sinister night, a woman is found wandering around Paris' 4th arrondissement suffering from amnesia. The story sounds somewhat controversial for the fact that it appears at first to be a simple case of a missing person turned up, but all of a sudden, the initials of the leading Chinese atomic scientist are found with tattoo on her buttock. This is just the starting point of a real tension-tensed and dramatic adventure of suspense and intrigue into the world of international espionage and shrewd illumination shrouded in a thrilling and fascinating breathtaking conclusion."
1,Not the best,"I have studied Titanic for many years, starting way before James Cameron's film. Many of the ""facts"" presented in this work go against those given by tons of other authors and explorers of Titanic. The author seems very full of himself, trying to give himself credit where he doesn't deserve it. It almost seems as if he is trying to convince everyone that he was a co-discoverer of Titanic and Robert Ballard's best friend. I would recommend another author, one who actually has a love for Titanic and isn't trying to make himself look better."
2,Another good one from Joann Mapson,"I just wrote a review for another of Joann's books called A Bad Girl Creek Novel, this Book and Good-bye Earl are a set of 3 books that go hand in hand with one another. You won't go wrong with purchasing these books, this set is one that should definately be made into a movie."
1,Would be great if it worked,"Maybe I got a defective item in this shuffler. Bought it as a gift for my kids. I tried it out to make sure it worked before giving it to them and unfortunately, it is now back in the box it came in because only one side of the shuffler pulls the cards in. We really wanted them to have a shuffler so we went to Wal-mart and found one similar that works perfectly. The price was so inexpensive that we didn't bother sending it back to have to pay shipping. Again, it could have been one bad apple in the bunch. Somewhat of a disappointment."
1,way too much,"I am not usually so critical, and I must admit I read several of the books years ago, but I finally put them down without reading the rest because there was just too many descriptions of sex in them. The detailed and varied descriptions were simply unneccesary for a book that is touted as a ""must read"" for women as young as 10!"
2,shining star,This is a great pot.. I used to microwave my frozen vegetables but now I steam them and they come out looking lively bright colors. I also use the other part of the pot for other things also and cleans wonderfully.
1,Fahrenheit 451,"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, takes place in a futuristic society where reading books, or the written word, is against the law and if you get caught all of your belongings, house and all, get burned to the ground.Even though this book is completely unrealistic to our society and has firefighters burning down homes instead of saving them, it offers an insight to what live would really be like if there was no written word and if technology ruled our lives.Guy Montag, the main character and our look into the firefighting world, is a man content with his life and never thought of the right and wrong of his job until one day when everything goes wrong and he feels that his freedom is being oppressed.This novel contains some action and it better reading for an older reading audience but will be liked for years to come."
2,Great selection,This pack comes with a wide variety of products. It is a great introduction to the Komenuka line. I really enjoyed how clean my skin felt after using the cleanser. The moisturizer is light and not at all greasy. I would recommend this line to anyone.
2,A BOOK THAT DEFIES GRAVITY!,"This is one one of the few but great books on my bedside table. Ever since a sentimental favorite book of mine. Eversince taking up and graduating Aeronuatical Engineering in college and a flying course after, this book together with the Bible was always on my flightbag thereafter. Now I even have a copy in my office. It supplied me with inspiration and motivation. It describes the joy in fying, the drama and excitement of flight and the philosophy of the air. A wonderful book and true adventure in a paperback book to aviators and non-aviators of all ages!"
2,Luxury for a steal,I must say I was very impressed with this item. I recently wore these silk pants with a smoking jacket on a cruise ship. They were very comfortable; they look and feel wonderful and are worth far more than the price. Another hit! I don't know how these folks do it; but Intimo's prices are amazing! I would highly recommend these silk lounge pants.
1,Clan of the Cave Bear,"This book was interesting with great promise. The premise was fascinating but the writer fought with herself throughout. She spent a great deal of time on the flora and the fauna. There was always a paragraph on a bush when a sentence would do, a sentence on a tree when a word would suffice. The characters were well developed. Over all it was a good read."
2,THE MOST BADASS BAND ON THE PLANET!!!!!,"THESE GUYS JUST GET EVEN MORE DIRTIER, NASTIER, HORNIER, DRUNKER, AND JUST PLAIN F$#%ING GROSSER EACH ALBUM!!!!! SAY SOMETHING DIRTY IS SOOOOOOOO GREAT, IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION YOU'RE LISTENING TO SOME CHICK GETTING HORNY WHILE A GUY BEATS THE S$#T OUT OF HIS OLD MAN!!!!!!! I PLAY THIS ALL THE TIME MY GIRLFRIEND COMES OVER, AND BELIEVE IT SHE WANTS ME TO SAY SOMETHING DIRTY!!!!!!!!"
1,Snooze Fest,"Welcome to Gus Van Sant's attempt to be artsy. The problem with this movie is nothing happens. Absolutely nothing! Throughout the whole movie we follow the lead character as he evades alomst all human contact and says about two words throughout the movie. This is loosely based on Kurt Cobain's final days, but this movie has no point. Van Sant tries to make a statement on the struggles of a troubled soul battling himself and others to find happienss, but his approach does not work and instead the viewer is left asking themselves why did Van Sant make this movie? This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,OMG Soulwax owns,"wow - this is like the most amazing album ever. Every track so rocks...specially1) E-talking2) NyLipps3) I love Techo.great job guysMusicChoice played their whole album this Saturday night..and I was jamming to it the whole time going ""wow"".one more thing, if you're not into House/Techno/electronic then you don't want none of this, cause you won't feel it."
1,Totally trashed my skin!,"I bought this at Ulta after doing some research regarding chemical peels helping acne, and one of the sales associates recommended this product. My acne has always been pretty mild, but I wanted to see if I could get it under control better. My skin is extremely delicate. My skin actually felt great for the first few days of using this product -- balanced out my skin tone very nicely. Perhaps I should've stopped there, as after a week I broke out with HORRIBLE deep, cystic, painful acne that took me weeks to get over. The scars/pock marks they left behind were even worse. I would be wary if you have sensitive skin. Fortunately, the folks at Ulta remembered me from a few weeks prior and refunded my money. Sadly, I did almost no explaining as my face told the whole story."
2,What a book!!,"I am using this textbook in a class and it is a whopper. Wonderful pictures, easy to read, clear colors and understandable. I've been working in prisons for 5 years and this book makes a lot of sense. You ought to read their sections on women in prison and on probation. I loved the parts on geriatric prisoners (old cons) and the death penalty. And it is easy to read. More!"
1,WARNING - Don't read the Introduction first!,"My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction. Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!). If you pick up this edition, just skip the Intro, or read it AFTER the book. Otherwise, Hardy's novel is a great story with insight into noble character. Hardy gets 5 stars, Oxford U Press gets 1."
1,The non-chef's cookbook (subtitle: Not just for dieter's),"I have had this cookbook for a couple of years without really using it. But a few months ago, I pulled it back of the shelf and never put it back on that shelf since. I never considered myself a good cook. In fact I am just the opposite, the typical single guy who used to eat out all of the time. This book has definately changed that. The recipes are very easy. And the dinners that I have made do not taste anything like diet meals. I recommend this cookbook for everyone - dieters as well as non-dieters. I am also not the type to write book reviews (this is the first and probably the only) except that I think so highly of this cookbook that I wanted to recommend it to others."
2,Really good book,"I had to read my mice and men in 8th grade. So it would be easier, I got the book on tape. It was easier indeed. Of mice of men is one of the best books that i have ever read. I think that it is great the relationship between Lennie and George. And how the other's character just fit into the book. I would totally recomend this book to ANYONE"
1,"Feel nice, don't hold up",I bought a pair in maroon and they were a little short but fine. The problem was that they started coming apart at the seams after 2 months. Will definitely be looking to a different company for a replacement pair.
2,beautiful representation of janet as a person,"this tour was very person and as janet represented from the start of the concert, an open book of HER story of her life, music, feelings and so forth. The concert begins with a big book being opened and then seperated into two screens then comes janet. She sings songs from velvet rope which are perfectly mixed with classic dance hits of hers over the years. A lot of the control and rhythm nation songs were made into medleys though some of the ones with intense choreography like If, Rhythm Nation and so forth were performed wonderfully. Janet also created great new chorography for what about, you and i get lonely which could have also been singles. I wish Everytime was sang on this show though that ballad is just so beautiful. It was great to see rope burn and special included."
1,Product did not work like I thought it would,"Based on the reviews I saw, I assumed that is would be perfect for keeping my blinds clean. That was not the case at all. It does not clean the dirt off your blinds the way you would think. I am very disappointed in this purchase."
1,I feel as if I got scammed by Paramount,"Let's start out with the film. I would say that this Transformers film rivals the first one in quality. It's really that good. I would give it a solid four out of five. This was the first film that I had seen in IMAX 3-D after returning to the states from being stationed overseas. I was completely blown away with the 3-D effects and sound. However, I feel as if I have been duped by Paramount in that when I opened my blu-ray combo pack there was a 5 or 10 dollar off coupon for the Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3-D, Blu-ray/DVD+ Digital Copy! I know that the studio is trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of us, but come on! They probably had the 3-D version ready but wanted to milk us some more. I would not recommend buying this version and waiting on the newer one scheduled to release soon.So to summarize:Film- 4Shady Blu-ray release business practices- 1 (negative if I could)"
1,Borefest,"One of the most boring books I have ever read. This books jumps around and makes it difficult to read. Also, The Overall story is boring. If you want a book to put you to sleep, look no further."
1,Not like I remember it,I bought this book 'cause I loved the movie when I was a kid. The book is really dry and a little hard to relate to. It's very English with lots of Moor descriptions.Couldn't finish it. Want it?
2,Ten bloody stars. In justice if I don't review this after One Years of heavy duty use,This little thing for 9.99 is just mind-blowing and amazing. I thought today if I don't review this it is not fair. This little thing has so much of power. I use it EVERYDAY. For the past year or so. I have forgotten and slept over night leaving it switched on for like Eight Hours of time that is not including the usage of during the day time. The best value product I have ever bought for 9.99. I used it everyday and still using it. If I can give it a Ten Stars I will give it. Don't think just buy it. Just a tip have cover on top of your Coffee or Tea where it will stay hot as you just made it. Two thumbs up and Ten Stars.
1,smells bad,"Smells bad, just like any other tanning lotion, and the smell stays on your skin all day. would not recommend"
2,Great game for toddlers,This was a great game for children. My toddler nephew who loves Caillou loved this game and it was one that he was able to play lone without very much adult supervision.
2,Definitely worth reading,"This book provides a great insight into the history and design of type, and quite a bit of the commentary is useful even today. Morison is well known, of course, for the Times New Roman face - and there is a section in the book on that face. But his commentary on the designing of faces like Plantin and Bembo is much more interesting, if you ask me. Also, if you are at all a fan of Eric Gill, you will like the section on Perpetua and Felicity. Anyone interested in the history of type should have this book, that much is certain."
1,Comic Book Movies Suck Especially This One,"Batman is nothing but Hollywood garbage from a director who has created much better films such as Following and Memento. The plot is preposterous even though the creators claim they were trying to make Batman more realistic. The train action sequence at the end, pardon the pun, completely derails the movie from any realism they attempted to create in the first half. Morgan Freeman pretty much recycles the same role he's played a million times. I have no earthly idea why Nolan wanted to make a superhero film. Your money is better spent elsewhere such as the new Skinny Puppy DVD The Greater Wrong of the Right. Don't waste your money on another superhero film. Give a message to Hollywood that you want something original and creative instead of the same old Hollywood schlock."
2,R is always off the hook..........,"I just picked up this new Cd yesterday..... It is pretty much what I expected, which is that it would be the bomb; the only complaint I have is that it is a little repetitive- The songs are str8, they just sound really similar. But, saying that- this is R Kelly, and he can get away with it. I can't wait to put this disc to use in the bedroom, cuz we all know that's what R's music is really for!! One love..........."
1,poor sound mix on many of the tracks,"Great artists, great track listing, extremely poor audio mix... should have forgotton about the DTS as there was no 5 channel mix to speak of...actually made arrangements through Amazon to exchange mine for another copy as there were several flaws ar the end of all the sentences on the tracks by EJ, clapton and Paul. Unfortunately, these sound flaws ruined the experience but I'm hoping the replacement copy will be of better quality."
2,Great Blocks,"My daughter loves her blocks. She will get them all out and look at each one until she finds her favorite. She likes to shake them and see what each one does. These are cute little blocks that have hours of imaginative playtime inside. They also have blunt corners, so no sharp edges like wood blocks for the safety of smaller children. The fact that they have the letters of the alphabet and a corresponding object inside makes them a great learning tool even for older tots. We have really enjoyed these and recommend them to our friends."
1,I thought this book had too much irony in it.,"The Mayor of Casterbridge was a very interesting novel. In my opinion Hardy uses too much irony, and this kills the fun of the whole topic. It is true that every day is filled with irony, but it shouldn't be in somthing someone is reading. the novel also shouldn't be too predictable, I guess that's why Hardy likes irony. If you are a reader who likes suspense and tragedy then this book is for you."
1,"missing pieces, no response from company","I needed this for a small repair job , but thought it would be useful to have around for years to come. I ended up returning it because parts were missing and the company never responded when i contacted them on their website.A note in the box requested that issues be resolved by contacting the company rather than returning the item, which I tried to follow, but when they don't respond to contact through their website, what is one to do but send the tool back?you can use this tool to repair your broken canondale road shifter bosses (on the downtube). just replace the easily broken bar with a slightly larger hole and a couple of m5 rivnuts and you're good to go. you can also easily install water bottle cages to any sheet of metal you can drill a pair of holes in."
1,"Great fun, but bad design, pops apart, and that's all folks!","When it's working, it's fun to watch it go up and down and around, but the battery is basically between the two pieces which are held together by a o-ring, no screw, no plastic ridge to pop it together, so basically it's really easy to pop apart, especially when turning it on and off involves twisting it, which many times makes it pop open. (The battery being sprung is pushing against the o-ring)anyhow, get a kid near it, and it's fragile setup basically ends up in two pieces in the water, and water in the motor, and days drying out... after a few times of this happening, the motor has started to turn slow (probably starting to rust inside).If the company could redeisgn this to get a positive locking to the pieces, this toy would be a home run, but as it's stands, it's really just a great idea stuck with a poor design."
2,possibly maybe my favorite,"i am writing this review after having listened to her most current release, volta, and i can stay that this is probably my favorite album of hers. the music is great, and the lyrics are unique and cheeky. this is actually the CD that first introduced me to her and i have been a major fan ever since. check out ""army of me"", ""hyperballad"", ""enjoy"" and ""possibly maybe""."
2,Clay's the real winner!!,"This is the first album I have truly enjoyed for many, many years. I loved every track. They gave me chills and tears! He is destined for greatness. Expect this album to top the charts for months and set all kinds of records!!"
1,Not Deserving of its Clout,"I know that ""Herland"" receives quite a bit of praise and is highly regarded. In my opinion, the work doesn't bear up under these accolades. The story is down right boring, which is disappointing considering how engaging Gilman's short stories and other works are. The plot is odd and the message that Gilman is trying to convey is lost. I saw another reviewer call this work a satire, but I would strongly disagree. Gilman did not intend ""Herland"" to be a satire. She was attempting to show that women were more adept at ""social housekeeping"" than men were.Unless you have to read it, there are many other and better Gilman pieces to absorb your attention with."
2,"A classic, revisited after many years","I read the John Carter Martian Series all the way through in my adolecent years, and have always maintained fond memories of the stories. I recently decided to download them to my Kindle and read them again. I was amused at first by the writing (written almost exactly 100 years ago now), not so much for the phrases and words (though they are amusing at times) but the style and the way the characters are portrayed. This is truly a peek at the sensibilities of an older age.However, once you get over (or used to) the over romanticized hero, to whom no danger raises so much as an eyebrow, you will live (or re-live) a classic tale that is nicely told. It is fun as a middle aged adult to again read these stories, suspend all disbelief and scientific knowledge, and just enjoy them for what they are! John Carter made a permanent imprint on me as a kid, and I'm glad to see that it remains still."
1,Worst CD of 2003!!!,"Clay Aiken is at his absolute worst. If you're going to spend hard earned $ on a CD don't waste it on this one. You can't even dance to this garbage. Spend your bucks on ""Speakerboxxx/The Love Below"" by Outkast and you won't be disappointed. BTW... Claymates, Clay belongs on Broadway!"
1,Endorsed by Edwin Meese and George W. Bush,"As to be expected of a book endorsed by Edwin Meese and George Bush, this book talks about how to permit right wing fascism by undermining the balance of power afforded by the Judicial Branch. Phyllis is in her typical form, blasting judges for such things as ending segregation and protecting human rights. Like another reviewer said, past the title there is nothing new. If you want to see where people like Reverend Pat Mahoney, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell get their ideas of how to destroy this country by breaking down the balance of power so that they can build a murderous Theocracy, this book is for you."
1,Not Thrilled,I was disappointed with the amount of ON SCREEN displays there were and found it too distracting to even play. After you hit the ball there is a streak that follows the ball. I found this annoying. I ended up taking it off my computer and found a different game that I like MUCH better. I'm glad I didn't pay a whole lot for this. It was disappointing.
1,sizes recomended in the size chart are not real,sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it
1,Not much here,"Beware this album - it's pretty much just pop in a boring spectrum of forgettable melodies and very thin, lyrically. There are a few more traditionally-rooted tracks that exhibit some of the rich, emotional harmonies and inventive beats that are responsible for the rise of African music, but they don't justify the purchase.There's probably several hundred pop titles out there that bear as much weight as this fluffy. Definitely not one to light up a party. If this one makes it to someone's Desert Island Collection, I'd rather drown..."
1,"About as scary as a "" Facts of Life "" reunion special","The Haunting is incredibly mediocre, even to the point of making you laugh when you should be screaming. The plot is weak, the script is empty, and the acting is subdued. Well, what do you expect from a movie that has Zeta Jones in it? Actually, the scariest part of the movie is that they didn't allow a good actor who played a bit part ( Bruce Dern )to be the main character in the film. Trust me, you've seen this movie a hundred times before. Even The House On Haunted Hill was better than this turkey."
2,A masterpiece,"This movie, pure theater in celluloid, is really a masterpiece. If I could save only ten films to see the rest of my life, Sleuth will be one of them. It's extraordinary how Olivier and Caine play their roles in this embroidered, strange, peculiar and unbeatable script. A rare jewel. Don't think twice: buy and see this film and do word of mouth with your friends... spread the buzz. There's nothing like this, nor even remotely."
1,Too boring to finish,I got this as a free selection. It was so incredibly boring and I could not finish it. Don't waste any amount of money on it.
2,Very good book,"This book is a good one. When I first read it it was about a six on my scale of 1-10. But now I have started to realize that it is more of an eight. maybee nine. This book goes so much deeper than one can imagine, and when you think about it it really is a shock. A shock of how much the american dream has changed, and how friendship can be destroyed. This book does make you think of society and the hopes of reaching goals, it challenges and disturbes you as you read it (actually as you think of it). But overall this book is powerful and it plays on your emotions quite weel, so it is definately a good choice of reading."
1,uggh!,I ordered this border for my new twins nursery! It is truly a cute colorful boarder. I was so excited to find it a a great price! Now i know why!I had one whole roll on the wall and neither of the other 2 rolls would match up to the one i already had on the wall! The borders were different widths! Which throws off all the lines on the border!I even checked the lot numbers on the packaging and they all matched? I had to get very creative to make it work since I already had a whole roll on the wall! very frustrating!
1,A Little Disappointing,"I loved all of Sophie Kinsella's books. This book is definitely not as good as the Shopaholic Series. The characters aren't really well-defined, the plot meanders at the end. You can avoid this book and not miss much."
2,Awesome deal!,This was an absolutely awesome deal on great diapers! Pampers diapers have always been my favorite and I am thrilled that I don't have to carry the boxes while grocery shopping with 4 kids.
2,Classic and essential,"Let me clarify something: I give this recording four stars only because I prefer his late-period playing (post-1965) to his modal playing simply because he became freer with his employment of scalar and atonal techniques. Having said that, ""A Love Supreme"" is an astonishing album and one that all serious listeners should own. It stands out from Coltrane's earlier modal works by its devotion to the spiritual aspect of music, an element that also dominated his work in free jazz. Trane plays beautifully and very distinctively throughout, his keening sound alternately gliding over and colliding with his remarkable rhythm section. If you're considering buying this album, stop considering it. You'd be crazy not to."
2,Easy to install,I was looking for a shower door that could open from either the left or the right and I did not want one to choose for me. This door ticks and fits all the right boxes in that department. I like the crystal glass effect too. It is very clear and allows a lot of light into the shower hub. It is frameless too which is what was asked for by the wife.Its sturdy quarter of an inch thick glass also is a nice feature. But most of all the pivot door is a feature I got on with too.
2,Chore Boy Golden Fleece,"I grew up using these on dishes (mainly pots and pans) because my mom always said they work the best at getting off stuck on food without ruining your pans. Then, once they get old, after a month or two, they ""graduate"" to scouring cloths for cleaning sinks! Now that I am an adult, I can't stop using them. I even have my husband hooked! These are becoming harder to find in local stores and grocery shops, so I ordered them...and got a great deal!"
1,Received wrong product,"I ordered Constantine and got another DVD instead. I shipped back Constantine at shippers request. Haven't received Constantine yet. Please credit my credit card as it's been to long. I no longer want the DVD.Thanks, Al Pins"
2,great stuff,These are just the beat scrubbies I'ver used. They don't scratch and they last forever. None of my local stores carry them anymore.
2,It works,"I'll start with the negatives:As someone else wrote, the tip-to-tip measurement isn't 54"". I just measured mine, and it's around 42"". That's a big difference. False advertising, I think it fair to say.Also (as the other writer wrote) it's odd that the sock (which fits around your light) is centered in the diffuser panel. Most everyone's lights are offset a bit (the shaft fits *next* to the light, not the middle), and so to get it to fit, you have to bend the umbrella quite a bit (which then deforms the reflector, because the umbrella is the reflector).Now the positives:That said, it does work, and the photographic results I've gotten are very good. All things considered, it's a good way to add a pseudo-softbox to your lights, for about $70. Better options are available, but they cost more, may be heavier, and take up more space. So, I view this as a good low-cost option, for those who aren't ready to plunk down thousands on a more sophisticated system."
2,Very nice cut and quality,Fits me as if it were custom tailored. I highly reccomend this item. I have paid twice as much for shirts nowhere near as good as this one.
2,Good!!,I like this product. The power code is nicely kept in the unit so I do not have to worry about losing the power code. Kids love it when their friends come for sleep over. Quick and easy to use.
2,Good For the 'New ' No Limit,"C-Murder is obviously Master P's little brother. With a similar delivery and all most identical voice, he finally has begun his approach out of his big bro's shadow. Kinda sad to see some of the faces gone after No Limit has revamped(biggest manuever NO Beats by the Pound), but their new musical style is gonna keep them in CD players all over the streets. This album has a handful of 'gems'. I personally like the songs Damned If They Murder Me, Down for my N!gg@s, and Hustlin. Gotta love Krazy(2Pac's vocal clone) and Mac brings it every time. C-Murder keeps up with the basic formula for song concepts that has made No Limit famous. If your a No Limit fan you've already got the album. If your not, this is a quality album but definately peep a few more albums off the label to fully appreciate how far they have come. Keep your CD's spinning."
2,Great diapees for my little one!,"My daughter is currently 4 months old and I am definitely a Pampers fan. She started off with the Swaddlers, but I have moved over to Baby dry on occassion... depends on what is on sale at the time. I really like the BDs, and I actually think they absorb wetness much better than Swaddlers. The only thing I don't like is that the aqua color shows through her white onesies. Swaddlers are much more subtle if she's wearing tights and a dress.I haven't had one tear yet, FWIW.Also, there are two different kinds of BDs. There are Caterpillar - Flex (or whatever it's called), which is what I currently see for sale at Amazon.com, but there is also a non-flex version. I like the Flex ones much, much more- I feel like I get a tighter seal around her waist."
1,This is THE BRINK OF TIME. shame on ... for not tel,"its not that bad, but it is just nbot chrono trigger and it doesnt keep the feel of the chrono trigger music. BEWARE of this cd, i only ordered it because I though it was th OSV, WHICH IT IS NOT."
2,Good explanation of Batman's origin.,"I liked this movie because it delved into the origins of Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman. It was not cartoonish like the previous series of Batman movies had become. After the first batman with Jack Nicholson, it was all downhill for Tim Burton. I highly recommend this movie."
1,Don't read this book while operating heavy machinery.,"Holy god, don't buy this book. It is intensely bad and over-appreciated. 1000 words cannot even begin to do justice to the extent of this book's worthlessness.Clearly, 18th Century vernacular is a hurdle in any book, but I doubt Garrison Keillor could rework this story into something bearable. The story is an exercise in description and banality. There is virtually no inertia or direction to the plot, and characterization is hopelessly shallow.Seriously, don't get this book. I'm warning you. I love great literature, and I hate this book. Ok...""hate"" is a little rough, but I really, really don't like it. Try something more enjoyable; like stapling your hand to your eyelid.Ok, just so I have not wasted all your time, read anything by Wilde or Kafka instead. Read some freaking Mark Twain, for goodness sake. Just lay off the Goldsmith."
1,Pamper Baby Dry are more like Pamper baby wet!,"I have a 2 Year old boy and ever since he was born I use Pampers because they where the best product that work. I started with Pamper swaddlers, baby dry, cruisers and night time pampers. For the 36 months of using this product I had a couple of licks as usual but recently Pampers Baby Dry are not the same. THE DIAPER QUALITY HAS CHANGED; they are thinner and feel just like any generic brand diaper and they don't hold up to 12 hours as they claim. After using many diaper brands I chose Pampers because I had less licks but now it doesn't matter. I'm very disappointed because I spend a lot of money on diapers that are not up to the price. My Son's Baby Dry Diapers is just as good as generic diapers now. After 36 months o buying the same diaper I noticed the difference on the quality change; thank you Pampers Inc for making a despicable quality Diaper for a higher price."
2,Great Read From Amazon,Have read this book at least 3 times. This edition is excellent if you have good eyesight. The print is very small and not very dark. I read it under a very bright light and it was fine. It would be good for a student. Good to read on a train on the way to work because it is so lightweight.
2,America has hidden poverty & poor have a culture of poverty.,"White poor, black poor, urban poor, rural poor are included. This book was one of the driving forces behind the ""War on Poverty"" of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Now conservatives more than liberals see that we have a culture of poverty with generations of welfare families. Help is needed, but it has to be a workable solution. Liberals, conservatives and radicals seem not to really understand this culture. Perhaps help will come from a revived labor movement."
2,Superb Spark in Top Form,"I truly enjoyed this novella, with its tropes of double identity adding up to a delicious comedy. I also want to praise the writing (I cannot fathom how the commentator just below me could miss this) which is spare and elegant and makes every word count. You don't need to know anything about the Lacan case -- I had never heard of him prior to reading Aiding & Abetting -- but it helps to be interested at least somewhat in the British aristocracy. That class' bizarre double standards and pure unconsciousness about certain flaws has never been brought out better. In fact, Sparks' illustration of the aristocratic attitude is scary in its amorality.A very entertaining and representative novella and a terrific introduction to Sparks' work."
2,Really liked the book,"When I first read the book a lot of years ago, i loved it and thought it should have been made in to a movie It's been at least 30 years since I first read it. I enjoyed it so much"
1,Avoid.. Falsely advertised,Very disappointed with this purchase. I bought this based on product details on Amazon which listed special features and extras - a major reason for my choice. There is only the movie on bluray and DVD. Please correct item details Amazon.
1,Review From One Book At A Time,"I hate giving classics bad reviews. This book was not for me. Nothing captured my attention and I found that I had to force myself to read it. If it had been any longer I would have stopped. It did catch my interest a little in the end, but not enough to redeem the book in any way."
1,Paper Jam Issues,"It's all true about the paper jam issues. After a while, you need to manually load each piece of paper for it to pick it up. Once the paper is fed, it prints fine. It's getting the paper to feed that's the issue. It's very frustrating!! Next time I'm buying a different brand!"
1,"Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road - hello Shlocksville!","""El Dorado"" fails on all levels. Truly, this is a CD to avoid. Elton's fans should avoid it for the lackluster rhythms, simple chromatic melodies (if you can call them that)and banal Tim Rice lyrics and forced rhymes. Disney film fans - this is NOT Lion King of the Central American Jungle! There is no grand opening melodic sweep like ""Circle of Light"" - instead you've got the moronic repetition of ""El Dorado."" There are no ballads like ""Can you hear the love"" - so there's nothing to compare it to. And the comic songs isn't very clever, although ""It's Tough to be a God"" comes close. One last comment, I could buy the Spanish rhythms - after all the main characters are Spanish - but where the hell did the country/western sound come into the picture at all? Dreamworks, if you want to rival Disney, get Phil Collins to do your music next time."
2,The best crossover ever,When Thanos collects the six infinity Gems he becomes the most powerful being in the universe(He wants to destroy all life to impress lady death). it is up to all the superbeings in the universe to steal the Gauntlet but when that is acheived it leaves the way for a greater evil
2,One of the best albums I've heard in years,"This is a front to back cd which is a rarity. Kershaw puts together intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics with layered music that always has a lot going on.His creativity in terms of sounds that he comes up with is incredible. One can hear a little radiohead influence on this album.His transition from 80's alterna-pop to his now contemporary 90's acoustic-based sound seems so natural and is actually an improvement on his earlier stuff. I can't wait to hear what he comes up with next."
1,fatima,the author uses a great inspiring event to sneak in at the end of his story his personal perverted idea of morality..this book iwould describe as a piece of garbage..i assinged my copy to the garbage disposal where it belongs....
1,TERRIBLY BAD RECORDING,I Love Gloria and thought this was an album featuring both artists together instead u get six tracks of staney then six of Gloria not together at all and all very badly re issued on cd please dont waste your money as I did
2,Great quick read,"Read this book many years ago in high school, but had forgotten all but the basic plot. I guess reading it for pleasure (vs assignment) gave me the opportunity to really think about the quality of writing as I read. Great quick read with a thought provoking conclusion."
2,A Moral Novel with a Mystery,"I read this book during a high school vacation. Although the long words and unconventional characters did not catch my fancy, the mystery involved in the story captivated me. As the story developed, I realized the profound intricacy of the plot. The conclusion of the story was not happy, nor did it even seem fair. As one who knows Hawthorne's puritan morality standards, however, I say that he communicated his message extremely well."
2,"Good, but not their best.","I still think Arms Around the World is, to date, their all-time best. Blaze is creative and fun, and even though it is ""praise and worship"" it is still plenty original. And they have at least gone back to their original sound, which is where they sound best. Still yet, none of their stuff impresses me quite as much as Arms Around the World."
2,A Startling & Rare Translation of the German Classic!,"Hughes' translation seems as rich, exciting & electric to modern readers as the original text must have been to audiences a century ago. It avoids the stiff awkwardness that former English translations have been known for, while still remaining true to Wedekind's dark symbolism and expressionistic overtones. A must-read for theater-lovers and practictioners alike."
2,We finally find out how Bruce Wayne became Batman,Awesome movie. Loads of action. Finally find out how Wayne becomes Batman. The 4 previous movies never told you how he became Batman all you knew was he was batman and his parents were killed. In Batman Begins you find out how he becomes Batman. Well worth it. I love the way they set up for the sequel. Katie Holmes is hot.My order of the Batman movies go like this:1)Batman2)Batman Begins3)Batman Returns4)Batman Forever5)Batman and Robin witch was ok but was pretty dumbThe order of the batmans themselves goes like this:1)Micheal Keaton2)Christian bale3)Val KilmarThe worse Batman was George Clooney good actor but not a actor to play Batman sorry George.
2,Magic,"After 3 c sections, I need all the help I can get. I started with the size Large (when I was a size 12). I have moved on to the medium (I am between 8-10 now). The medium is REALLY tight, but does the job. I prefer the large day to day because I have 3 children under 6 to run after, and it is a bit more comfortable for that. These things are really great. I can't believe I didn't know about them after my first 2 c sections. They should send all women home with them after giving birth!"
2,good cheap alternative,The only downside to this adapter vs. apple's is the lack of the light ring which tells you whether the computer is fully charged or not. Otherwise it's a great deal!
1,Logitech Wilife outdoor dead camera repair C26 C27 C31 C32,"The Logitech Wilife outdoor cameras have a known defect (caps melting).[...]They fail in about a year. This is due to the following four 1000uF caps: C26 C27 C31 C32. The initial was a10v cap then later releases were 16v. I replaced them with 25v. See Digikey part number UHE1E102MHD6. The caps are from Nichicon and are Aluminum Electrolytic. They are rated for 10,000 hours at 105 degrees C. The caps don't fit perfectly (the original are 8mm diameter versus 12.5mm that I put in) so insulate the leads and let them float above the circuit board.DLC-810e, CLC-110e, DLC810e, CLC110e, Lukwerks Outdoor Camera, 961-00290, Wilife Outdoor Camera, Logitech Outdoor Camera"
2,of mice and men,Awesome! I wanted to read John Steinbeck books because I live in Monterey county which is the area he wrote about.
2,Gorgeous singing of gorgeous music,"I bought this CD on a whim. I knew nothing of either of the performers or the composer, but I am a fan of Danish song so I thought I'd give it a try.The songs are wonderful (the first two songs on the disc are among my favorites) and the singing/playing is top notch. Inger Dam-Jensen is an established singer of both art song and opera. Her work on this CD truly extraordinary, not only technically but in terms of interpretation as well. Mr. Teglbjaerg (pronounced Tile-byehr) does a fine job at the piano.Composer Peter Heise lived during the time of Schumann and Brahms, and though he isn't as famous as either of them, his songwriting ability counts him among the best. Highly recommended."
2,Paranormal epic,"This book is a rarity in UFO literature, primarily b/c most UFO books present their information in dates and names and places and events ... in a sense, completely without any feeling or substance beyond the 'happening.' The shocker of the ending of THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES you already know if you read the 1st chapter, but, as you've been drawn further and further into the lives of the main participants, the ending hits you like a sledgehammer b/c you've spent the last 250 pages forgetting all about it. More UFO books should be written with this humanistic approach; perhaps then the subject wouldn't be so taboo."
1,Pure luck with no strategy,This game is boring because there's no thinking involved besides doing what the dice say.The game pieces are kind of cute but isn't challenging enough to keep age 6 and up entertained.
2,Of Mice and Men,"This action packed book was filled with laughs, and tears. George Milton and Lennie Smalls are best friends. They have been working together for life, and one day plan to have a little house with crops and animals. They both go to work on another farm, and it seems to be working out for them, so that one day their dream can come true. But then Lennie gets into big trouble that costs two peoples lives and affects many others."
1,HARD TO FINISH,"I found this book not worth the $$, it was well written but too sweet and hard to finish. Definitly not a page turner."
2,Give in to the power of J,"If you are an old 2SJ fan, you'll find enough classic 2SJ appeal to quench your thirst for those driving beats and hip-hop stylings. For the uninitiated, there is enough commercial slickness to songs like ""Grown Up"" and ""Lemon Drop"" to bring you over to the darkside. Give in before it destroys you!"
1,Junk,"About 30% of the time this printer will actually recognize that it does, in fact, have paper in the feed tray; often paper needs to be fed by hand. It also jams about 50% of all paper that goes through it. You cannot simply tell the computer to print a document and walk away from it; you have to sit there the entire time, feeding individual pieces of paper into the printer and pulling out the jams one by one. Also don't even think about running it without both ink cartridges. When my color cartridge ran out, I let it go because I don't do a lot of color printing. HP apparently really wants me to go out and buy another fifty-dollar cartridge because in all honesty about every two seconds during a print job (between the constant paper jam and lack of paper in tray messages) I received a pop-up telling me that I needed a color cartridge.I think I'll go back to Canon."
1,Even Claude Rains is subdued,"Paul Muni won an Oscar, but not for this surprisingly dull movie. Claude Rains, lovable rogue in Casablanca, isn't lovable or rogueish as Satan in this movie. Anne Baxter is whiny. I bought this for my daughter, because she loved it. Oh, well."
1,Great idea--terrible design!,"Bought this for my 5 year old Justice Leaguer. My son is not a rough player but we went through 4 (YES, FOUR) of them before we finally got one where the elevator didn't break in the 1st 2 weeks. Mattel needs to get their act together and design toys that have durability. VERY disappointing!"
1,save your money,"This book is little more than a pamphlet. It's written totally for men in the younger age brackets. I also bought and read I Can't Believe I'm Buying This Book: A Commonsense Guide to Successful Internet Dating. That book is much better, and has much broader scope and depth. Save your money on this one."
2,Puts into words and ideas moral concepts that can be difficult to explain,"I have a sixteen-year-old who is questioning all morals. I was finding it difficult to put into words the importance of morals. I bought this book for her to read. She isn't reading it, but I am and I'm finding it very helpful in facilitating discussions with her. At dinner time I bring up one of the seven moral virtues and ideas that the book presents. I've found that it leads to great conversations with her about character and moral behaviors. It has given me the words for concepts that can be difficult to convey in our current morally challenging times. I recommend buying this book when your children are young and referencing it often."
2,Great value,"My friend had her bridal party order these dresses. I ordered 2 sizes. The size that the chart said I should get was way too big. So I ended up needing the smaller one without any alterations. Anyhow, it's a REALLY cute dress, and the price was VERY affordable. I don't remember it saying so, but it comes with a matching wrap, and unfinished spaghetti straps that you could have sewn in if you preferred."
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Your Time!,"Boring, dragged out, thought it would never end! This movie is terrible!!!!! NOT fun like the other Batman movies!!!!!"
1,Veclo stap to large,"I like everything about these shoes except the velco stap is enormous and overpowers the entire front of the shoe. My son looks like he is wearing orthopedic shoes, I had to return them he just looked way to goofy"
1,Terrible,"What if you live outside of New York? This book isn't applicable for anyone outside ""The City."" Buy a book from John Bridges instead."
1,Worst second season I've even seen,What happened to the writing on this show? Got rid of a great character and actress to replace her with a very unappealing replacement. Plot bounced all over the place.What a disappointment.
1,Sparkly and pretty...,"but when you put the necklace on, you can't even see either the sparkle, or the beauty of it. The stones are very small, which is expected. What is not expected is that the stones are linked by 3...(Meaning, 3 stones seem to be soldered together, then connected to 3 more stones, etc.) This made for an awkward appearance when worn since it's not ""fluid."" In other words, the necklace would ""flip"" constantly, and all you saw was silver and not the ""topaz.""I considered keeping it anyways because the price was great, the stones are sparkly and the color pretty, but the 18"" wouldnt fit 3x around my wrist (2x made it too large) to be worn as a bracelet of some sorts.Unfortunately, this will have to go back. I wish it was better designed for more movement of each stone so that it laid better against the skin."
2,This rocks!,hey this ce interview is a must for all hardcore No Doubt fans! there is so much info about gwen and the boys!
1,Cheap Not worth your money,I purchase this air mattress in late October and two month later I was laying on the mattress I move my arm and a fist size hole appear over my head. The mattress arrive fast and was easy to set up. If you plan on using this mattress for a guest bed or for your kids when they come home for the Holiday or summer break please get something else. Not worth the money. I had Coleman and small hole appear and the patch does not work but for this mattress the patch does work for a small hole not the fist size hole.
1,Garbage Product - Stay Far Away,"I read the first few reviews on here and decided this product was a good buy. I couldn't have been more wrong. After a few days of usage it started to charge for a second, then stop for a second, repeating on end. I've read some more reviews, and it seems this is a common problem. Though it seems other people are satisfied with this product, so my advice would be to stay away from a product with such an evidently high percentage of lemons unless you feel like rolling the dice."
2,A SLICE OF HEAVEN,"What's better than ""A Love Supreme""? I don't even have to elborate because ""A Love Supreme"" like ""Kind Of Blue"" is justPERFECT.Pure artisty and musicianship.This is music that calms you and heightens your creative wonderment.There's nothing better.There's nothing that I can say about Coltrane that already hasn't been said.A essential album.No musical collectioncan EVEN be called a musical collection without it."
2,Linus tells us what Christmas is all about,Charlie Brown wants to know what Christmas is all about and Linus has the answer. Can you imagine any other show daring to give that same answer today? Just a gentle reminder from Charles Schulz that the simplest answers are always the best.
2,Education DNA,"This book and story takes the reader into the world of education at the grass roots rural level. From the one room school house with 20 year old students still mired in the first grade to brilliant students from impoverished backgrounds. A terrific review and account of cultural conditions in the 1930's, from the depression to WWII. A must read for educators/teachers. Many of the methods and means used by the author will shock and surprise today's readers, but this is Kentucky in the 1930's. Imagery depicted is fantastic."
2,AMAZING,"I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of my CD. I was at the concert in Atlanta and was mesmerized during the entire show. It was so surreal..to be in the company of Barbra and Il Divo. I know the CD will be great. It will be the first thing loaded in my car. And, it will probably stay in there for quite a while. There is and will be no other Barbra. I only wish she would tour more often."
1,Not worth 1 cent,"As a fan of Wu Tang Clan for the last 11 years I find myself being more dissapointed with each solo cd released.This by far is the worst Ghostface cd and the worst solo cd from the clan. I bought it the day it came out, listened to it once and that was it.Ghost needs Rae, Rae needs Rza and Rza needs to go back to what made Wu Hot with the beats and shaolin sounds. And please if your going to make another cd Ghost please put Wu members on it. Want a 5 star cd go back to what made Iron man hot, thats the only cd of his worth buying."
2,More mature look at Garbage,"Seven words: ""I want Shirley Manson to adopt me.""Why? Because she exudes the powerful, seductive, and charismatic character that makes Garbage a force to be reckoned with. In addition to the radio-friendly ""Push It"" and ""Special"", Garbage shows a similar but more mature scope of musical stylings in this, their sophomore effort following their self-titled debut. My personal favorites: ""Temptation Waits"", ""When I Grow Up"", ""Medication"", and ""You Look So Fine.""Seeing them live made me just love them more, and I think first-time listeners will immediately appreciate the mystical powers of this electrically-infused band by just listening to this album. If everyone listened to it and heard Shirley speak to them the way she speaks to so many through music, I think everyone would want Shirley to adopt them."
1,Could have been,"A book from the author of Struts, can you possibly go wrong? This book shows you can. The book does not have a flow to it, to me it seems just scattered topics piled on eachother. And then, the grand finale, where all you have ""learned"" is applied in a real world type of thing... By the time it got there, I got so annoyed I did not care anymore. The examples rely on so much non-standard struts stuff, I have trouble with the title even."
2,Excellent Rice Cooker,Great product. Perfect rice every time. Excellent for brown rice. Keeps rice warm. Also does excellent job of cooking grits. Easy to clean. Takes a little longer to cook rice but the flavor is worth the wait. Pricey but great quality. Would highly recommend this product.
2,An important tool in supervising your kids' education.,"I am not a professional educator or homeschooler, but as a Dad I need to be sure my kids are learning the things they need to learn. This is a very helpful resource to me because it gives an overview of what kids should be learning at each stage along the way. (Fortunately, my kids' school seems to be doing pretty well in most areas.) This resource helps me plan what areas to supplement with home reading and projects."
2,Enjoyable,Vanessa-Mae is a talented musician. The songs are varied going from classical to popular to standards. It's very enjoyable.
2,ProTouch Cover,"I like the ProTouch Keyboard Cover. For the money, it was a good investment. There are several covers out there that may be better, but this was a cost effective option until I can find a better cover. As others have stated, it takes a little getting used to as far as typing with the cover goes, but I'm sure that any cover will have this. It sits pretty well on the keyboard without moving. I live with four Australian Shepherds, and did not realize the amount of dust and hair that lands on the keyboard until I got this cover for my new MacBook Pro. Makes me wonder what is in the keyboard of my old iBook.The only thing that is missing from this cover is something that protects the palm rests. I will be looking for this in the next cover that I get."
1,Terrific music. Horrible disc!,"This disc is a third-rate BOOTLEG, with horrible sound quality. You can get this material in far better quality through trading. Don't be a ""sucker""!"
1,i have question,"i was wondering if anyone else who has purchased this amp is having the same problem as me. i am using an old advent 300 as the pre-amp. the souce is either a laptop or mp3 player. at the beginning of a song or when the music is slightly muted the amp kicks off, the music stops. it's very irritating because it give the music a halting quality. when it's picking up the music it sounds great....but i can't listen to it when it's doing this. i am not an audiphile so it maybe something in the setup but it seemed pretty straight forward. thanks for any input."
2,Not as good as the first,With version 2.0 Grabage tries to relive the newness of the first album by upping the techno and yet they fall into a very pop like atmosphere in a series of their songs. But as always the are at the head of the pack.
1,A Disappointing Reproduction,"Whilst this edition/reprint includes the Charles Cotton supplement, the print quality is abominable. This is most evident when you look at the etchings and woodcuts. If you have seen the originals, they are crisp, clean and beautiful. In this book, they are little better than black smudges, with no fine detail visible. The tale in it's completeness is one thing. The etchings and woodcuts should add a beauty and delight to the whole experience of reading and owning this book. This version, printed on poor quality paper, is a huge disappointment."
1,I'm switching back to Swaddlers,"I figured for the price I'd give pampers dry a chance and now I'm incredibly disappointed with this product. I'm not exactly why it's called ""Pampers Dry"" since it does a horrible job at absorbing urine. On many occasions I'd have to change my baby's clothes simply because the urine has run up her back and wet her clothes along with my bedsheets.I'm going back to Swaddlers!"
1,"Terrible book, do not read it.","Hawthorne's dull prose really gets to you after a while. The book is filled with antiquated language, and is basically an account of a Puritan woman who suffers because of her adultery. I was forced to read this book for my English class, and it was a terrible waste of time. Hawthorne hits you in the face with run on sentences that take up the entire page. I do have one good thing to say about this book however, for all you insomniacs out there, read it! It induces sleep in minutes! ZzZzZzZzZzZz....."
1,It didn't work.,It didn't work. I was excited that it came in fast. but the game does not work. it made my kids sad. Waste of money. I do not recommend buying this game. First time it happened to me. Good luck if you decide to buy it.
2,A bit uncomfortable...,"I had to exchange the size but the small is still _really small_. It gives me a nice shape but I should probably be wearing a medium. I am a size 6 with a belly left over from a 25 pound weight loss. It's tedious to put on and I'm exhausted when I finally get that last hook hooked! There has to be an easier way! The back support you get is awesome but sitting in it can get uncomfortable after a while. I recommend wearing it over a light weight tank of some kind. The material used irritated my skin a little bit and it made me sweat a little. Should you buy it? If you are tolerant of the ins and outs, then go for it. It was inexpensive."
2,Terrific book,"I loved this book! The photographs are powerful, and you can't find anything even close to their documentary quality anywhere else. The text is also interesting and includes quotes from a variety of people--the author, the hip hop performers themselves, and other scholars."
2,Be forewarned... this is NOT the movie!... THANK GOD,"A love story infinitely more readable than the Sleeping Beauty set, it delves deep into the human psyche, and attempts to explain how and why someone would choose BSDM as a lifestyle. Plenty of erotica, and a plot too! A great read!"
1,Masochist Dearest,"Can anyone who watches this movie ever erase from their mind the scene where Crawford finds out Palance and Grahame are plotting to kill her and goes stark, raving mad? It an Olympian display of overacting that has never been equalled: Crawford pulls at her hair, wildly darts her unfocused, bulging eyes, clamps her ears shut, pulls tight her grimacing mouth. A lunatic chimpanzee receiving electroshock couldn't do justice to Crawford's facial contortions here. I guess the reason that Crawford is such a fascinating screen presence to fans and nonfans alike is that she's a relentless masochist. In movie after movie, no matter what terrible fate befalls her, no matter how many times she is betrayed, it's nothing compared to the mental punishments she visits upon herself. The movie itself is serviceable but fairly ludicrous; there are glaring plot holes almost never seen in true film noir. The entire switched-identities ending is just about as bizarre as Crawford's performance."
1,stuuuuuuuuuuuuuuped,i didnt even listen to this cd but i had good right to because my friend said it sucked balls horid!!!!!! and anywase i dont like clay aiken because he sucks and gets more recognition than ruben the real winner.
2,"Great Price, Great Product",Love these and easy to use. You really can not put it though twice though if you mess up. I have only used it on a laser printer because that's what it says it's for. Awesome price so I don't wince too much when I mess up. I'll only buy these from now on.
1,Disapointing,"I don't know what it is about this book.... I had heard about it from a friend and looked it up here on amazon, it had enough good reviews for me and I decided to get it. I was very disapointed, the story line was good and the characters could ahve been interesting and fun, but there is just something about this book that made it VERY dificult for me to get through and even harder to really like. I felt no connection to the characters, and the romance between Jessex and Kirith Kirin was just.... it didnt seem real to me. I truely don't know what to say about this book. It wasnt my favorite but I cant say it is the worst book I have ever read."
1,Measure of a man........Clay Aiken,"I had waited for a long time for this CD to come out and I was really looking forward to buying it. I'm no young kid (age 69) and think he has a beautiful voice, however, I was so disappointed in ""Measure of a man""! I was hoping he would have some of the songs from ""Idol"" or at least popular songs that I had at least heard before. I still think he has the most beautiful voice that has come along in a long time, but I'll tell you, before I buy his next CD, I'll sure make sure to look at the selections of the songs before I buy it!! I think he should pick his own songs next time instead of letting other people!!!!"
2,Of mice and men,"This is my favorite Steinbeck novel. It is a beautiful story and a must read. One of the few books that I would like to read again. Simply put, this is the story of a TRUE friendship between two men, one of whom is mentally challenged. Read it!!"
2,Back to the basics,"Dark, hard-hitting - the Batman I have grown to love in the comic book. Still an interpretation of the Batman myth, but a believable and engrossing interpretation. The supporting cast are phenomenal, highly recommended."
1,one step above ice cold,dose not keep coffee hot a step above ice cold I was very disappointed I though since it was a Mr. coffee it would be what I wanted wouldn't not buy again.
2,"A can't put it down book-- taut, inspiring, frightening","One of the ten best adventure / mountaineering books I have ever read. Hodgson takes Kocour's adventure and guides the reader on a compelling, frightening, frequently shocking, sometimes inspiring climb up one of the world's most difficult climbs. Brilliant! I will be very surprised if this book does not become a best seller."
1,An Aquaintance with Darkness,"Emily Bransbury's mom just died a week ago,her best friends mom was arrested for haelping the assasanation of Aberaham Lincoln. Now she needs to live with her Uncle Valentine. But when Emily finds out about his night life she puts her and her uncle in danger.My opinion is that it was to long for me. After a week of reading it I was sick of it. Plus it was way to slow.I wouldnt reccomend this book because in some spots its hard to tell whats happening. Plus it is long enough you may not want to read the end.I would say its a good book for book clubs. You could help each other with the confusing stuff, and with the words. For people my age i read it a long time in advance."
2,Cute! Light reading but a lot of fun.,"For those not familiar with black America this is a great introduction--especially into the whole hair issue. (You cannot understand a black woman if you don't understand black hair and all its issues). If you are already clued in, then this is a great little vignette on a set of topics that can loom quite large in the lives of many black American women--hair, skin colour, and the quest for a decent man.I enjoyed this book a lot. I read it in one sitting, way into the wee hours of the morning, because I couldn't put it down. I since lent it to my sister who got a message of self-empowerment out of it. She then lent it to a friend who loved it, and it is now in the hands of a friend of hers!That said, this is not capital L Literature, but it is fun."
1,Under the Tuscan Sun,"This was one of the most predictable, syrupy, twisted excuses for a movie I have seen in a long time. Based on unlikely premises, this movie is about a woman who gets the very raw end of a divorce (we're supposed to feel sorry for her within the first 3 minutes of the movie) and then takes a vacation (courtesy of her gay lover friends) and buys a villa in Tuscany based on a whim. Somehow she has enough lire to fix things up, enough moxie to make friends with Italians (?) and live in a small town. In case the audience doesn't ""get"" that men are cruel and heartless, she has yet another experience with a philandering man whom she has fallen for (but never bothered to tell him). Finally her pregnant gay friend from San Francisco (now herself jilted by the 'man' in her relationship) comes and delivers her baby in Tuscany, creating a 'family' that our protagonist always wanted in theory. Gimmie a break. This movie rates one star because the scale doesn't go lower."
1,The display is only partially working.,The batteries are new and the watch TALKS .. but the numbers only partially show up on the display. The watch worked perfectly for the first few days then it started acting up .. I changed the batteries and the problem still exists.
2,Best Diapers,"Among the Pampers Swaddlers, Costco Kirkland, and Huggies Snug and dry, this is so far the best and I am 100% satisfied and don't even want to try other brands. It is the softest one, even better than Pampers Swaddlers. It smells good but I think a little bit too strong. Use it for my baby day and night. Don't even to buy the night diapers. It is pretty dry even after the whole night."
1,Missing The Other Five,"Like one of the other reviewers, I ordered this as a pack of six. However, it arrived and it was a single canvas in a giant box. What happened to the other five? When I contacted Amazon, it says that they're out of stock for these. Why is this happening to more than one person? Just be sure to check your box. The canvas was nice and actually what I wanted but I didn't want to pay for six and get one..."
1,Disappointed with the finish,The unit I received is full of scratches on the surface. I am not sure if it's a brand new unit or not. since it works fine I just didn't bother to exchange for another one.
1,No Driver for the Windows XP Pro x64 Operating System,"The LaserJet 1020 is a fine printer for use with older operating systems. It produces high quality output when attached to my Windows 98SE box. But it doesn't print at all when attached to my new computer with its XP Pro x64 operating system. The problem is there's no compatible driver available, not on HP's LaserJet 1020 installation disk and not on the HP website. I emailed HP Tech Support about the problem and they suggested two workarounds, using x64 drivers for other HP printer models, but neither worked. Tech Support now says to try working the problem via online chat. I'll try that next time I have a block of several hours free, unless I give the printer away first."
2,BULK PACKAGING,"These came in a tiny ziploc bag with no retail label. Not as big a deal as had this issue been instead with the headset that they are going with, but still... It'd have been nice to have known what to expect."
1,Ultra-overrated,"I picked up this book with such high expectations-Ray Bradbury is relavtively famous, the book is fantastically reknowned, and it is about censorship, an issue that I really care about.Well. My expectations were smothered, stabbed repeatedly, and left on the floor to die. This is not a good book. Bradbury's writing is incredibly confusing, and some pivotal parts of the story are so removed from the main plot that you can't understand them.Bradbury has a penchant for killing off characters. For example, one character, that changes the life of the main character, is dead 20 pages into the book. If she was burned 'cause she had books, fine, but she got run over by a car. How stupid is that?Pass this one up, and for a real futuristic utopia, try 1984. Just not this."
1,Does the job that I expected,"I received two of this brand of mug warmer. I only ordered one, but I finally resolved the issue with Ace Hardware.I love this Mr. Coffee mug warmer. I have one at work and one at home. I don't throw away coffee like I did before, because the mug warmer does keep the drink warm. I am pleased."
2,"Nice, but not indispensable","There is nothing to complain about concerning this album. Desmond lives up to his self-imposed ""slowest alto player""--playing slow tempos with long spaces between notes. Truth be told, the real standout on this recording is Jim Hall, who plucks away on guitar with superb technique. A nice outing by Desmond and Hall.Paul Desmond (alto sax)Jim Hall (guitar)Gene Wright (bass)Gene Cherico (bass) track 5Connie Kay (drums)"
1,This movie dropped !,Come on ! Rated PG-13 !? This is why the movie was stupid ! They made Robocop act funny and dumb. What happened to Peter Weller the orginal Robocop !? The story in this movie is lame but the only credit I give this movie is the fact that Robo has the new weapon which connects to his hand and the flight pack.
1,Very Dissapointing,"If you're interested in only buying this to listen to the interviews and comments of artists who were there, and finally getting to hear from Rosenman and Roberts, then by all means buy the DVD. But if you're buying it for the musical content you'll be very dissapointed. They edited a lot of the songs horribly and cut the life out of them."
2,Don't listen to that bad review!!,"I thought twice about buying this because of that horrible review... SOOOO GLAD i got this cd now! Way better music and more singing less ""talking"" (talk/singing-samples). Miss kitten shows us that she can make more than electroclash and techno beats. Other than #2 (dance) and #4 (rock)this cd is more TRIP HOP than anything. While i would never compare it to baxter or dot allison I WOULD say many of those fans might like this. Much more intelligent and sad feeling than album 1, not as dancy."
2,Gon' hed Musiq,I love this CD..I am a big Musiq fan.. This cd is good from beginning to end. The musiq is very pretty..and what I love about him is that he is so creative he talks about things other people really dontMy favorite tracks are#1 Soulstar#3 Womanolopy#6 whoknows..very pretty track#7 babymother...I love this track#12 Her#13 whereareyougoingall the real Musiq fans stand up..and go get my boy's cd..its tight..it deserves more than 5 stars
1,Lost my Bike,The fasteners on this thing are awful. I was driving down the highway and after going over a bridge the bike flew off my car because the fasteners stripped and came undone.Spend more money on a nicer bike rack. Now I have to get a new bike and rack instead of paying maybe 50 bucks more and still having a bike.
1,Buy the Originals,"Many of the numbers are by ""members of the band"" and do not give the true sound of the original. Some of the vocals are truly bad. Save your money and buy the originals which are readily available at reasonable prices."
2,Well made CD by C-Murder,"Tru,this CD does not rank up there with his debut album ""Life or death""in terms of emotions,but the party joints on this CD are enough to make up for that.When C-Murder does try to be emotional in ""Where do we go""feat.Young Silkk,he fails.The beats are too fast for an emotional song and the vocals are garbage.The good songs,however,are ,#2,#3feat.Snoop Dogg and the Eastdidaz,#4feat.Master P and Erica Fox,#5 feat.Da Brat and Jermaine Dupri,#6 feat Fat Joe,#10 feat. Mystikal,#14 feat.D.I.G and Master P,#15 feat.Mac,Magic,and Ms.Peaches,#19(this a very funny interlude with Soulja Slim's music playing in the background),and #23 feat.Snoop and Magic."
2,Thoughtful Portrayal of Early 20th Century Rural Virginia,"Ellen Glasgow is definitely an underrated American female writer; how many have heard of her? She writes elegantly and truthfully. The setting for Vein of Iron is an area of rural Virginia where I spent much of my childhood. I don't think it has changed much! In this novel, there are wonderful passages about the impact of Christian beliefs on the life of the people who settled in the region (which can surely be generalized to many rural settlements throughout the U.S.). Glasgow creates a fascinating character in Ada's father, who struggles with his spirituality. Ada is strong, faithful, optimistic- just as I imagined our female predecessors to be at that time. This is a character-driven, setting-driven novel, and I loved it. My daughter surprised me with it for mother's day. Thanks, daughter!"
2,1.5 million people can't be wrong!!,"Well this is a great cd...and it seems to me that selling the most albums and having more appearances is the REAL TEST of who is the AMERICAN IDOL!!!! Top of the billboard for weeks, and out sold all other American Idol Albums..this is a great selection. This is a can't go wrong, must have!"
1,"Great idea, poorly engineered","Where were the engineers for this toy, is what I'd like to know. What a great idea it is, but it just doesn't hold up to play. Now, I suppose if you're willing to bolt it into your basement wall, then it would hold up to some strong playtime. However, it is almost completely incapable of withstanding any play whatsoever without collapsing onto the floor. I highly recommend you read all the other reviews on this toy prior to purchase. Definitely needs to go back to the drawing board - ours went back to the store! What a disappointment!"
2,Shakespeare's best!,"I love this play. The words are so beautiful, and the story never fails to draw me in. And I must admit that the language is hard to understand - but the New Folger Library is the way to go. I love them! They make it so easy and understandable for all of us who don't say ""wherefore"" for why. So if the language is intimidating you get the New Folger Library. But getting back to the play itself, it is fantastic, and something that everyone should read."
2,The most powerful quote...,"""Intolerance is a thing that causes war, pogroms, crucifixions, lynchings, and makes people cruel to little children and to each other. It is responsible for most of the viciousness, violence, terror, and heart and soul breaking of the world."" -page 226 in the 1998 Perennial Classics (excerpt from 13 year old Francie Nolan's diary)This quote is what I believe to be the most powerful. It wrenched me to it from the moment I read it, and made this book worthwhile to me. It was a wonderful book, but I might have read it much faster if I did not keep turning back to that page to read that quote over and over. It stuck in my heart, and will stay there forever. It made the novel for me."
2,"Nice portable, small GPS receiver!","I have had this unit and used it for a couple of years now. the reason that I bought it was its portability and I could use it both in the car or have it with me when I am walking. So, from that aspect, it is very nice. now every positive normally comes with a few negatives. as you may guess, due to the size of this unit, the receiver is probably not the most powerful or accurate receiver, so you need to learn how to cope with these aspects of it. I have had cases where the receiver got confused when I was in the city (San Francisco) with a couple of tall buildings around or when I was driving around on windy roads in Sierra. But other than that it has worked fine for me and I have used it in town and country. I found another navigation SW for it that I think is nicer and performs better than the one that came with it from HP. (...) mine is an MMCX."
2,Excellent song ever from ANASTACIA!!,"I played this record and boy, this song is off the wall. The original is way better than the club mix, but the club mix is good to, actually it's between good and way better. Played this song for 2 hours and danced to it. I may have lost few pounds from it. Give this song a try it's not a waste of money. I swear on it."
1,looks good but doesnt work as great,"the monitor looks really cool on the hand while cycling or at the gym... however due to its design, it does not provide accurate readings. the finger has to be in a specific position with the sensor and that too without movement if it has to be anywhere close to accurate. I'm going to stick with the chest strap for accurate readings."
2,Sanity in Economics,"This is economic sanity. Easy to understand. If more people and especially those in government would read this book, we would be better off."
2,an outstanding product,"This ""grabber"" is the best designed unit I've ever purchased, and I've had several different designs. I strongly recommend it for purchase by those having trouble stooping, bending, or reaching."
2,great,It was a good movie for sci fi people who have already seen the stargate series. came to our house quickly
2,ok,it was good. one of the dvd's glitched after a while of playing. the screen froze and wouldn't play. the dvd's were dirty. i cleaned them up and seemed to work fine. so overall it was ok.
2,as advertised,It was the product my daughter needed for school. I find the book binding rather flimsy but it doesn't need to survive longer than her course and it wasn't expensive so I can't complain.
2,Great pair of shoes,The shoes are great-looking and even though they don't look very comfortable they actually are pretty comfortable after breaking them in.
2,Fun fantasy,I love the story line of this movie - a male Fairy Godmother! What fun. And Kathleen Turner as the 'wicked witch'. What a fairy tale concept.
2,Coyote Ugly Is da bomb!,Coyote Ugly is the best film i have ever seen. You won't be disapointed if you see it. The actors and actress' are wicked!i give it 2 Thumbs up
1,The paperback version is unreadable,"I bought this book in the paperback. When I opened it up I realized it was printed in VERY poor quality. The font on the writing is VERY small compared to others, about an eight or ten font on Word, and to make things worse the print is faded and not even crisp black print. I have good eyesight and don't wear glasses but I knew after the first two pages I would have a major headache if I continued reading this book so I put it up. If extremely small and light faded print bothers you, then you better not buy the mass market paperback version of this book!"
2,Razer charger,works amazing in my car without any problems. Lights up a bright blue when charging and actually chargers my phone up.
2,Pampers,Works great on my little one. We did try different brands but for some reason Pampers seem to be good fit for her.
1,Really boring,"I know a lot of people are going to be mad at me for saying that I HATE this book, which is why I have decided to leave this anonymous. Anyway, it's probably just a personal thing. It was very boring. The fact that I had to read it for my english class and write an essay about it probably didn't help, but I NEVER would have read this on my own. The writing isn't even that great. And the only reason people like it is because it's a classic. And the only reason it's a classic is because you've been TOLD it's a classic! It's an old book, and it has some theme and deep symbolic meaning, blah blah blah. But if you actually want a good book, I don't suggest this one. If you have to read this for your english class, I feel sorry for you."
2,Great quality at a great price,"We use Subscribe and Save to purchase our baby's diapers. What a great service! The price is very competitive, and usually beats the local store prices (even with coupons). We use the Pampers brand because they absorb well -our baby is a heavy wetter. We also collect the Pampers Gifts to Grow points and redeem them when we have enough."
2,Going deeper,"I read this book after coming blind to the foundation books - I've never read Asimov in a novel before. I've noted how Asimov, when writing the books, was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke, it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also, sexism is taken for granted, and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future, but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways, I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book. I now cannot wait for the finale of the original series and debate weather to read the other three ancillary books that Asimov wrote later."
2,A rollicking ride,"This is Roger Zelazny's masterpiece; a highly imaginative thing of beauty, Lord of Light tells its story at break-neck pace which will appease even the most easily bored reader. The language is fluid, often times poetic, and ultimately a feast for the senses. The story spans many years and depicts the epic struggle of one man who could have been god, against all those who now rule the world with an intolerant fist. Technology is precious, and hidden from the general populace who are forced to live in a sort of perpetual Dark Age so that the gods they worship may continue the turpitude that is their tyranny. The Hindu religion is used to exploit its followers and the pinnacle of its precepts--Reincarnation--degenerates into nothing more than a bargaining chip to further accentuate the gap in power. Roger Zelazny is an innovator without equal and one of the most important science fiction writers to date."
2,Shriekback's Organic - All Natural - High Bran Album,"Shriekback's Barry Andrews is a genius of the highest order. This album has the band ditch all synthesizers (A bold move! Electronics being heretofore their main life-blood.) Andrews' garage sale of the sorts of machines worshiped by pale Englishmen with funny haircuts and their ilk frees him up to add yet another depth to the Shriekback sound. Attempts to express my enthusiasm for works of art like the contents on this CD are ineffable - at least on my part - but I do want to register my 5 stars, and hope that anybody who follows my other recommendations will try this great work of art as well. This is like eavesdropping on Shriekback in a world of no electricity. Thank God somebody was cranking a generator or some such device in order to record this work. AWESOME in the organic, original sense of the word. BUY! BUY! BUY!"
1,"""O Brother"" Fans Beware!","Despite the clever packaging, this CD was NOT produced by the folks behind ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""As it claims, this CD does contain original recordings of many of the songs on the ""O Brother"" soundtrack. If you're looking for the genuine article, this is it.However, as is common with recordings this old, many of the originals were made by semi-professionals with primitive recording technology. As a result, these ""originals"" do not have the clarity, the warmth, or the production values of the masterful performances on ""O Brother"" and the companion live album ""Down from the Mountain."" If you're looking for music that sounds like those two albums, try Gillian Welch's ""Revival"" instead."
2,Great book,"I'm a big fan of Sohie Kinsella's I consider her one of my favorite writers, and I was so excited when I found this book. I was not let down, It may not be something I read again like I do Kinsella books but few are. I loved it, it is chick lit and as in most cases is sometimes predictable but I don't care, I still fully enjoyed this."
2,best shapewear,it the best shapewear says what it does everyone ask how you look so small bought 3 for friends loveit
1,ZERO stars,"I wish there was a way I could give this ZERO stars. The quality is awful. The ""satin"" looks like pleather and the feel is disgustingly cheap.It also does not fit true to size. According to measurements, I fit into a size large. Apparently the tape measure they have at the factory is not the same as mine.Now, I'm stuck with having to find a dress in less than a month."
1,Beg to differ,"While the book gives some interesting insights into Franklin's life, it is really a disjointed diary kept during his early days and during his very late life. It fails to deliver the real picture. I was particularly disappointed that it provided only but a mention of Franklin's early electricity experiments. Most of his middle life was missing. Amazon offers the book free so, you get what you pay for. I would rather read a studied biography."
1,Never Received,I never received the product in the mail. Needed it for summer reading for school and had to go to the bookstore to buy it.
2,Guidepost To A Somber Journey,"Leave it to Life Magazine to deliver both a poignantly illustrated and informative journey through the tragedy and heroics of 11 September. Unlike other publications of this disaster, Life covers all three crash sites. The photos are vivid and emotional. The information explains the minute-by-minute details while providing an illustrated perspective of the attack and aftermath. Life Magazine has been a valuable companion to other historic events, like JFK's assasination. This book is a guidepost along the somber journey through 11September and its aftermath. Treasure it."
2,Popular with middle school students,"This book was one of the most popular on the shelf for independent reading this year, with both male and female middle school students. Perhaps it was because it is based on an actual event. Perhaps the straight forward language used by the author appealed. Whatever the reason, as a teacher, I make note of any book that motivates students to read, and this one did."
2,I loved every minute of the cd,"I feel that version 2.0 was one of the best cd's of the year. It should have won a grammy. as well as the first cd 2.0 delived great vocals,gutair and a good beat. there is no need to skip tracks because all of them are well tuned to the point of profection. 2.0 is a must for anyone that enjoys rock or alternative. 2.0 the bands second cd shows improvement from there first album which was also a great album."
2,What a great boot!,"This is the second pair of Altitude IV boots for me and I can't imagine a better hiking boot for my purposes. I hike hilly, wooded areas daily and wear these boots throughout the year. My previous pair lasted three years and the only problem is the lining of the heel wore out. They are now my work boots.They look good and lace up well. Break in is immediate. I don't walk in rivers, but waterproofing lasted a year before needing treatment. Their lightweight and durability amaze me. The only thing that concerns me is that Hi-Tec might stop making them by the time I need another pair."
1,Cancelled Subscription,"I've been a long time subscriber to Men's Fitness and signed up for the Print + Kindle subscription. I have an android based tablet with the Kindle App and it would be great to read online and keep previous issues without taking up space. Unfortunately, Amazon/Men's Fitness does not support their Android based Kindle app, so I cancelled the subscription."
1,one of the worst,"This book was one of the worst I have ever read. I thought it was going to be inspiring on the life of Tiny Tim from The Christmas Carol story. Instead, it was raunchy, and totally boring. Shame on the reviewers who lured our book club with their praise of this book for the Christmas season. Couldn't even finish it - and I have never not finished a book in over 30 years. Blah!"
1,this games sucks,this game sucks so much dont buy this its full of glitches and stuff people can take over your stuff even if your in them and destroy your villages it take 20000000 words to describe how bad this game is in summary dont waste your money on this game buy something anything else!
1,This book Blew the bag Ha Ha By Steve Austin,Who ever wants a piece of me will have to tell me so on this web page and thats the bottom line cause Stone Cold said so
2,"Charmed, I'm sure...","This is the fascinating story of three generations, with a midwife/herbalist grandmother, her single mother daughter, and her bookworm granddaughter. The grandmother, Charlie Kate, is a fascinating, well developed character whom the reader cannot help but admire (she reminded me strongly of the aunts from Alice Hoffman's 'Practical Magic'). Somewhere between a medicine woman and a psychic, she was nevertheless predictable, in that she hung around until her daughter and granddaughter's lifes were fixed and then she died. Terribly predictable, but sparkling with its descriptions of WWII Raleigh and the life of an herbalist/midwife. The book leaves you wishing for a grandmother like Charlie Kate and a suitor like Tom Hawkings III. Good easy read- would make an especially good winter read, curled up in an armchair in front of a fire, covered by a cozy throw, sipping a mug of homemade cocoa."
1,Ho Hum Effort,"Fair representation of what could have been a great "" dog fight"" movie.The movie should have been edited down to less than 2 hours withoutalot of the frivolities that occur on the ground. You could still buildenough out of the characters to make them interesting without the prolonged love story. The action in the air is decent."
2,Helpful Book on Pastors Changing Churches,"Paul Robbins is the editor of this book, but each chapter is actually written by a different person. Most of the authors are pastors, and most of the chapters were originally published as articles in Leadership Journal. Various chapters discuss deciding when you should look for a new position, how to candidate (with very helpful questions to ask a search committee) and how to get off to a good start at your new church. The book is not so much about how to decide if its time to move, but rather when you've already decided, here is how you go about things. This is the most helpful book I have read on the subject."
2,still sounds good,"it's now official. . .KISS HAS BECOME THE BEST EVER KISS TRIBUTE BAND on the planet.the music still holds up and it is good in whatever package you want to put it in . . but if you want to hear something new you wont get it from KISS... until you stop buying these things, you will never get anything new from this band . . . ."
2,Measure of a Man,"Clay's voice is effortless, true, and glides through each song like silk. He is being true to himself, and honoring his fans. Randy Jackson said it best; it's THAT VOICE. That's all you need to know."
2,The best book I have ever read on this topic.,I recommend this book to all my friends and am actually buying it now for a friend who recently became engaged.
1,"Wait for the ""final"" boxset to be released","This DVD Trilogy box contains the two-disc editions of SM 1&2 and the single-disc edition of Spidey 3. However, 1 and 3 are available separately in 3-disc sets, and I'd be surprised if 2 wasn't given the 3-disc treatment right before Christmas. So, when the 3-disc editions of all 3 movies are available in one box (think Ultimate Matrix Collection), then that will be the one to buy. This box can be skipped."
1,"Terrible science, terrible acting, terrible dialogue, terrible plot","I grew up on transformers and, quite frankly, the 15 seconds of 'me grimlock' overheard in 'the Professional' had more going for it than ANY of these terrible terrible movies."
2,Farily decent movie,"I didn't like some of the plot twist, of a former leader of the Autobots but other than that it was pretty good."
1,Don't buy from Antonline,"We purchased this tripod for one of the larger Sony cameras that we also purchased through Amazon. The camera is awesome. The page for the camera recommended this tripod so we bought it from Antonline. This tripod is not nearly strong enough for use smoothly with our camera and when I contacted Antonline for a refund they refused to deal with me, even if I paid the shipping back to them. If you buy this tripod, beware that truly strong remote control tripods can start at $300 and go up from there."
2,nice work ATI,"ATI used to forfeit the driver quality game to nVidia, but with the 8500, things seemed to have changed for the better.This is the card to get if you can't afford Nvidia's Geforce4 Ti 4600 or can't find Geforce4 Ti 4200 in stock (as was the case when I bought this card)."
2,Cher and Olympia Dukakis glow in their Oscar award-winning performances.,"When Loretta, an Italian America widow, agrees to marry Johnny, confirmed bachelor and mama's boy, the fireworks begin. He asks her to visit his brother Ronny and invite him to the wedding. Not only does Loretta invite Ronny to the wedding, she falls in love with him. Her close-knit Italian family offers her their insights on love and life. Cher and Olympia Dukakis glow in their Oscar award-winning performances."
1,Shallow little girl,"Carlton thinks she is so damn profound, oooooo you came up with one of the most self important pseudo intellectual album names ever in ""Be Not Nobody"" Be Not Nobody? Try ""Be not educated."" This girl is a shallow child, and it shows in her daft music. Just because you drop a name like Steinbeck in a song doesn't make you smart, or worldly. Here's a cookie, now shut up and go play with your even more narcissistic pseudo-intellectual boyfriend Johnny Third Eye Blind. These two are cut from the same lame ass hipster mold that you can find in any of the coffee shop of Berkeley, pontificating on their own genius and never realizing that they are not special no matter what people tell them. You want real ""intelligent"" music; try John Lennon or Tori Amos. Listening to Carlton's lyrical drivel is like grading a freshmen Philosophy paper, it's trite and irrelevant."
2,Just what I expected,I knew this would be great. He has such an awesome voice. He can make any song great. This is the best cd I have purchased in years.
1,This Item is a Piece of Junk!,"I am thourghly disappointed in this Sansas View. It deleted songs all the time wont keep them on wont connect to computer, if it keeps them it puts them on 3 or 4 times and when you detelted the dups.it deletes them all."
1,A waste of a good plot,"I thought that this movie was going to be scary, and terrifying. In the end, it was stupid and meaningless. The plot was good, but it was played out all wrong. It was a waste of a good 2 and a half hours and it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
1,Guitar in Absentia,"With all due respect to ambient music enthusiasts, I was really disappointed that there was no guitar work whatsoever on this album. Hillage fans of L and Fish Rising be forewarned.Steve Hillage was a pretty darn good guitarist. Maybe L was his showcase with members of Todd Rundgren's Utopia backing him up.Noting that other reviewers have rated this highly, I will give it another listen. However, I am dissapointed in the direction Steve has taken his music."
1,Boring,"I dont know why people like this movie so much. It takes forever to get going. I know it has to setup a backstory but its still really boring. Doesnt even feel like a batman movie.It barely shows the villians. Way to much dialogue and not much action. Even the batmobile scene through the city isnt exciting. It goes like 25 mph. The blu-ray pic quality is not top of the line stuff compared to the best. I looks kinda like a upconverted dvd. Watch the preview of the dark knight on the disc and you will instantly see the difference. Also the ""League of Shadows"" storyline is laughable. Haveing just seen The Dark Knight a few days ago, i can say that it easily a 5 star movie. It starts right up and it entertaining throughout. 2 stars is for the movie not the bluray"
1,Wretched,"C.S. Lewis has to be rolling over in his grave, as this pathetic adaptation abandons his story early on and turns into a smarmy, boring CGI exercise. Pointless battles, pointless special effects, flat characters, ridiculous dialog and no sense of wonder at all. The film invents half baked soap opera subplots that go nowhere. I can't imagine a worse film adaptation. Prince Caspian is the weakest of the Narnia books, but it is a jewel compared to this dreck."
2,asking for an information,"Hi ,We are running a pub here iN Marmaris Turkey.Since long time we are looking for the production place on lite ice cubes to import here to Turkey to sale.If you would like to make business with us to sale this product here in Turkey to the clubs please ,inform us about the details...If you do not prefer to make business together would you help us where to find the production center of this product in china or in Europe...Thank youSincerelYBar SoydanZulal UyAnik"
2,Thumbs up,Great product. Now I'll be able to study for my final exam andNot worry about depending on others to help me study.
1,Do Not Buy!,"I bought this coffeemaker as a gift for my sister and was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box. First, the plastic top is extremely cheap and flimsy, and the whole thing broke off the first time we flipped it back. There was also a grey powder film over the whole appliance. Finally, it is just not good looking at all...extremely cheap in appearance. It did not even make it to the countertop before we had it back in the box and on its way back to Amazon. I went with the Bosch on their reputation for the greatest dishwashers. Evidently, another company designs and manufacturers their small appliances. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!! Get the Braun KF550-BK AromaDeluxe instead!"
1,Great Transaction!!!,"Received it broken but when talking to the customer help chat they refunded me ASAP. 110% satisfied with their service..,"
2,Tina Turner concert,"LOVE IT , LOVE IT, LOVE IT. I exercise to this DVD, 30-35 minutes at a time. The music is great, Tina of course is great. BEST exercise workout I have ever had and the scenery is FINE, FINE, FINE. Thanks to all who make this DVD possible !!!"
2,"of all the rom coms, this is the best one","Yes, Cher and Moonstruck are better than Meg Ryan/Nora Ephron's films including When Harry Met Sally. There's something about the visuals of the Meg Ryan movies that always bothered me (Pottery Barn magalogues bother me) but Moonstruck is EXACTLY what I like from the real estate to the brick lipstick. There are even lucrative plumbing contracting and bread operations - ooh!"
2,Fast mp3 download of music waxed decades ago,"One of these 26 songs played as background music on a YouTube video of some kind of gymnastic or dance feat out of Russia. I hunted down the melody, read the English lyrics, then decided to see what else was in the album. Downloaded the full album for $15 via Amazon mp3 downloader, and now happily listen to the melodies (interspersed) on my iPod."
2,Snug Fit,"Great product for giving you that snug fit...it does become very uncomfortable around the waist line if worn to long. I really do like this item, the only BIG issue I have is the fact that you can see the snaps through your clothing...so I suggest not wearing this with a tight fitting dress or shirt, because everyone will know your secret!"
1,Doesn't fit well/hard to take off,"I decided to return this outfit because I did not have time to try and pin up the polka dot underskirt to make it look like the model's costume. The underskirt hangs 2-3 inches below the top layer making the outfit look frumpy. The underskirt is sewn onto some black fabric that can be tucked up around the waist, but it doesn't stay there (and it makes your waist look bunchy).The laces are cute but are a pain to tighten to get the outfit to mold to my body (reference, I bought an x-small since I'm 5'4"", weigh 104 lbs). Also, this outfit is extremely hard to take off, which makes a romantic night in rather difficult. Plus, I didn't want to have to put in bra cups to give me some curves up top. The cut of the top made me look flat (34B). I think this would work well for busty girls.The material of the costume is of the quality I expected for this type of thing. Overall it was cute--but it just looks so much better on the model."
1,The usual dreck,"I had to read this when I was in high school. So did my children. Now my GRANDCHILDREN have to read it! None of us has been able to discover WHY! Of all of the superb books I have read in my life, not ONE has ever been selected for required summer reading!"
1,Vocabulary Extender,"Boring, poorly set up, no dynamic or real plan to sit down X number of hours a day and cover Y amount of material so you can become exponentially more glib. Just a poor attempt at a primer."
1,NOT GOOD,I was shocked at how poor these diapers were for a name brand. My 2 year old would constantly pee through these after being in one for only an hour! The Target diapers and the Huggies work much better for my son.
1,if they just shipped it with the magic pixie dust.....,"As with the other reviewers, this printer worked fine for a short while, then I started to get the ""out of paper"" and ""paper jam"" errors. I contacted HP, and was told that I couldn't connect the power cord to my surge protector and had to go directly into a wall outlet. When that didn't work, I was told to unplug the printer, wait 30 seconds, plug it back in, then repeat 3 times. At this point I decided to just return the printer."
2,great product.,Holds more weight than most armbands and has dual chambers. Made it easier to deflate casually as my daughter learned how to keep her self floating more. Of course if you over inflate or have a cement deck they will split or get holes but over the course of 4 summers I only purchased 6 pairs. I would consider that a pretty good track record for the extended swimming season we have here.
1,A decent enough OSV,"Aside from a few tracks, namely the memorable airship theme and few others, the CD isn't much more than a novelty; something to add to your collection. But look at it this way - it's Uematsu! Really, you can't much go wrong there..."
2,A personal look at the life of Queen Victoria,"I bought this set thinking it would be just another movie to add to my growing costume drama collection. I was really wrong. From the first minutes of this movie the viewer is hooked. I was amazed to find out how Queen Victoria became Queen, how she struggled with her mother and how she picked a husband.I must say A&E did a great job portraying the lives of these well known people. I really felt as though I was there living out her life.The costumes are great, acting is supurb and nothing could be improved on save for the fact that it wasn't long enough and tons of time was skipped.Good job and a great movie. I would reccomend to anyone who wants to learn more about Queen Victoria or someone who just loves good movies!"
2,the best of anastacia,"this would be a good time for america to wake up and embrace this tremendously talented singer. how this woman is not as successful in the usa as she is in europe is beyond me. so many great songs here. from the dance/pop/r+b of her first two albums, to the rock influenced hits from her third album. this is a great way to catch up if you've missed out on anastacia.also includes ""everything burns"" with ben moody from evanesence and her gorgeous duet with italian superstar eros romazotti, ""i belong to you"""
2,RPM Sensor Assembly,Great purchase. I was so frustrated and I couldn't figure out what was causing my garage door to reverse direction after just a few feet. This was an easy fix. Everything was packed well and shipped fast
2,A Majority of One,This is one of my favorite movies. Rosalind Russell and Alex Guinness are just wonderful in it. Great movie!! I am so glad that is finally available on DVD. Thank you Amazon.
1,A Qualifier,"There appears to be a good many who support this book, but none that actually ilustrates explicitly its hidden gem or genius, if there is indeed any. personally i don't see why it's so fantastic. the suspension of fixed parameters and a ""realistic"" framework in general seems to be an easy way to avoid the more prosaic elements and ensuing entanglements in life, and may also be construed as a rather cheap method to beguile readers into a seeming style and artistry."
1,Is There A Plot Here?!,"I had to read this book for my English class at school and I started out with an optimistic attitude reflecting this book. The beginning of the book was rather slow but, of course, I had to read it and was willing to give it a chance on account of it being such an essential classic. As I read further, though, I feel that the book could have develloped further than it did. What had been a trace of a plot at the beginning of the book had all but shrunken into a totally unnecessary conclusion that, I feel, had no thought or reflection on the main goal of the book."
1,Beware of the dimensions,"I bought this mattress as a spare guest bed for our vacation condo. I was delighted to see it described as being 80""x40""(a twinXL). It arrived and the box clearly stated 80x40 dimensions so put it in the closet for future use. Just pulled it out of the closet 3months late and inflated the mattress only to find it is a standard twin measuring 32""x72"". Nothing close to the stated dimensions noted in the product description and on the box."
2,Harmony Ridden,"This is one of those ""I bought the first one--liked it--but will I like the next"" cd's. But I took a gamble, purchased it, and I'm glad I did. Harmonium is a total mood piece. It puts you in this dark place with hope on the horizon. Like a million beams of sunlight streaming through. White Houses is plain fun ear candy. And San Fransisco is intelligent, catchy, and moving all at the same time. Vanessa pounds on the piano with such fervor in some songs, you feel like she's moving mountains. Then touches the keys so lightly you barely hear the melody. A grand album. Two times the charm."
1,Amazon duped. Me too.,"This game can NOT be played on the Xbox system that is sold in the stores today!! Maybe I should have known that, but I didn't. I feel as thought sellers should have pointed this out in their ad.My son has an older Xbox, and I am currently waiting for him to get that out of storage to see if the game will play there. Until then, my rating of the transaction is that it was the worst for me ever on Amazon.com, but that may change to an OK."
2,Jabra EarGels,These EarGels make using my Jawbone I for long periods of time much more comfortable. I just put the EarGel over the existing ear button and it fits just right in my ear. No need to push and shove to get it seated and tight. Makes for a better drive when I am not always pushing in on the Jawbone to make sure it stays put. Great addition to any bluetooth earpiece that it will fit.
2,Ultimate Gum Kit instruction incomplete,Once we figured out that you needed to add a teaspoon of water to the gumbase before you microwave it it was a lot of fun. The instruction say to pour off excess water but neglect to tell you to add water in the first place. My son and his freids had a blast making their own custom gums. I had to help with the kneeding process but over all I think it's a great product for kids who like their gum. You can substitute splenda for the powdered sugar if you want to make sugar fee gum too.
2,Fun movie.,"!Heather's teenage son!All right, all right. What's so bad about this movie? Really. Sure, it's got some crude bits but to me those are some of the funnies parts. And there is nothing wrong with Sandy having one line. She's not that important of a character, anyway. Do you see her often in the show? I do agree that Squidward needed a bit more screentime. I think he's quite funny. I love the TV show, and I loved this movie when I viewed it in the theater on opening night. The ending is most definately the funniest part of this little flick.And for those who think he is homosexual...You've got to be kidding me. He's supposed to be childlike, not homosexual. And what's so bad about homosexuality anyway? I have friends who are homosexuals. So, all of you overly obsessive Christians can go shove it. I'm a Christian, too but it's not right to bash homosexuality or the people that practice it. Sorry for the rant, but things like that do make me a bit mad.PS...Patrick rocks.4 out of 5."
2,Night Vision,"The standard lighting (headlights) on our 2001 Ford Ranger was disappointing. As you get older, you come to appreciate better lighting and the factory headlamps are poor. I tried the better bulbs from NAPA without a great improvement. Finally, I ordered the PIAA's and they represent a great improvement; they seem like twice the illumination of standard lighting. I only wish they were available in""off road"" strength."
2,"Its Paine, enough said",All works are untampered with and represents truth based reading as to the authenticity. Nice bound book to boot as with elder tradition.
2,Quality Voice,"I purchased this cd the day it was released and have listened to it almost every day. I followed the idol series from the beginning and thought Clay and Ruben did an awesome job in displaying their great talent. Clay's rich and powerful voice is an asset to the music industry. He is also a very likable guy with his goals, dreams and his honesty. I am looking forward to his next release and hopefully a little better songs to play up the quality of his voice."
2,Stable and fast!,"I am using this card on my new PC that I just built. I bought this as a cheap alternative to a USB type card. I must say, I will never do USB again. Strong signal and NO dropouts. Works great on my 64-bit system. There are no cons to this card. Buy it while it is still available. Other sites are out of stock!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"If you are new to Economics, this is one book that you can skip. It is not useful nor ""mandatory reading"" if you are looking to understand the subject better. There is not even one chart or graph included in this book!!! Stick with Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science or Economics for Dummies as these two titles will serve you better."
2,Funny,This movie is very funny and entertaining but using the Mario Brothers name maybe they shouldn't have.
1,doubleplusungood crimethinkers untruthful reviews,this morning at 235am dudes in ninja suits came into my house and stole my copy of this book. I was excited to read it before amazon.com stole it.
1,Glad to be done with this one,"I pride myself on finishing every book I begin reading, but this novel severely tested my perseverance. I kept waiting for the story to generate even a spark of interest but it just never happened for me. Admittedly Marquez is a gifted writer and for this reason I was tempted to award the book 2 stars, but if I had to sum up the book in one word it would be PAINFUL, thus the single star. I've read a number of 'classics' which were difficult reads, but there were usually rewards for the effort. I can't say the same for this book."
1,I couldn't get into it,"I just coulAfter getting more than 50% through the book, I had to stop ... I just couldn't get into it and didn't like the writting style."
2,impossible not to love,"This book is impossible not to love. It is one of my top 5 favorite books. The characters and the story touch your heart and change the way you look at life. I highly recommend this book to anyone, regardless of your taste in books."
1,Don't overheat your bottle!,"The Munchkin bottle warmer is quite easy to use, and does a terrific job warming bottles. In fact, it really can get too hot. If used strictly according to directions, this bottle warmer does the trick, albeit a bit slowly. I learned the hard way that it can also melt bottles. If you start from a cold bottle, it takes some time to warm it up to an appropriate temperature, more time than my hungry son will tolerate. Instead, I used it as a way of keeping an already warm bottle heated in the car until my son is ready for it. Unfortunately, this resulted in a carful of acrid smoke, a lump of melted plastic, and a black hole in his bottle as I was driving one day. If used appropriately, ie by checking the bottle frequently and turning the warmer off when warm enough, the warmer works well. However, resist the temptation to use it as I did, as a longer-term warmer."
1,Fans can never be objective...,From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...more soundtrack pop full from Elton and whereas The Lion King is a 1 star album this is 2 stars because we have double the fluff.
2,best parenting book,This was the best parenting book we ever read. It teaches you how to tune in and listen to your child and really hear what they say and don't say. I now give this to everyone I know who has a child.
2,Good product!,The Shoo Goo arrived quickly and has done a great job repairing three pairs of shoes that I would have otherwise had to throw away! Thank you!
2,Distrubing Portent of Socialism's Logical Ends,"This is the classic and the mould of the dystopian narrative. Clearly written to explore the plausibility of what would happen if the technocratic regime of the socialist state was allowed to take its course, it stretches beyond this very palpable social critique. The final part is the most disturbing and harrowing as one can almost feel Winston's physical and psychological torment in a world that forbids love and legitimates peace through fear.I am amazed that this was written so long ago since these drives in social order seem so shockingly prevalent and the spectre of war as a lever to condition responses from the masses is clearly a vehicle even in the US. It does slowdown in the middle with the very transparent political commentary wrought by Goldstein's manual. Yet the impact of what abuse and harnessing of technical, psychological, social, and political power punches hard at the end."
1,Who eats Fois Gras?,"So, Amazon, you're back to selling whale meat, fois gras, and other gross foods? What gives? Is it because few American's eat it, or even know what it is? And, it's expensive which helps your bottom line. So, why not take stuff American's don't or are forbidden to eat (remember the ban on whale slaughter is now world wide and it makes your selling of it illlegal). People are becoming more informed on a daily basis, and finding this kind of stuff on Amazon is little less than appalling, much less, law disregarding."
2,no such thing as a good anime ending!!!,Great disc the makes up for how slow paced season two part 1 went but it felt at times this disc was a lil too fast paced esp. on how some of the fist were getting beat up but still very entertaining wanted to see a lil more form to the fighters kind of how season one wanted to portray the martial arts mostly all out brawler at times not bad i guess still very entertaining worth 30 dollars yea probably you kinda get ur money's worth in entertainment i guess it to manga reading if you wanna get deeper into the story would've prob gave the masters a lil more background story but the 50 episodes what can you do :) :)
1,Typos,"The most irritating part about reading this book is the typos. The book is already difficult to read with Hawthorne's prolix writing. I had to check with a different edition of The Scarlet Letter just to confirm whether or not it was a typo. Also, it would have been nice to have some footnotes like other editions do."
2,Worth the money,"The only reason I did not give this a 5 was because it seems loose in the camera, but it does work great, and the price, well, you can't beat it. I purchased two of them."
2,System of a Down/Toxicity,"I would recomend this to any system of a down fan or any rock fans, it has great songs, my 3 favorites on it are Toxicity, Chop Suey, and Prison Song."
1,Terrible DVD of an impressive film,"The Stendhal Syndrome is an effective, stylish thriller from horror maestro Dario Argento. The film alone would rate at least 4 (out of 5 stars) but the Troma DVD is pretty appalling. The audio is hissy and the volume low and the picture is incorrectly letterboxed and riddled with digital artifacts. If the DVD weren't bad enough it's made even worse by having a horrible, embarrassing introduction and foolish, faux interviews with Troma president Lloyd Kaufman. A good film is severely cheapened by a poor presentation. A big, fat ZERO for the disc. Hopefully, Blue Undergroud or Anchor Bay or Mondo Macabro will be able to obtain the rights soon and do this film justice."
1,Don't be cheated,"I bought 6 of these shirts going by the photographs and some of the reviews. Dont mean to be rude, but people who gave these shirts probably haven't wore a decent dress shirt. You can frequently get 'good' $45 shirt for $10 in malls when on sale. I thought this was a better deal. But boy oh boy, I can assure you this is not much better than what you might get at a dollar store. I had ordered these as a gift, but now will give them to Red Cross because these should not be worn at any kind of formal occassion, or even for daily use (except maybe when you are working at Septic tanks or something). These are from Bangladesh, and I can assure you, they are not much better than what would be sold for $0.50 in BGD. If you have any self-respect and work in anything but a lowest income group atmosphere, DO NOT BUY THESE SHIRTS."
2,good,"this cd is awesome. tho i wont say its an improvement from wiretap, they do experiment a little. tracks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8-10, and 14 are all good tracks IMO. but the stand outs are tensioning and while oceana sleeps."
2,"The winner is....""Inside Oscar""","If you enjoy the hype of the Academy Awards, this is the book for you. Plenty of behind-the-scenes action that you're not going to find by simply watching the Academy Awards. It's gossipy, dishy, and dirty...a definite guilty pleasure. Great index of past Academy Award winners and nominees as well."
1,BEWARE if you have a widescreen TV!,"What's the deal, slipping the fullscreen version of Stuart Little in with the widescreen version of Stuart Little 2 and mislabeling the package?! A 4:3 aspect ratio film should NOT be called a ""Deluxe Version"" when there is a 16:9 version available. I feel very deceived/taken by this, and am docking these otherwise cute movies 2 full stars for Studio Stupidity."
2,Wonderful! Fantastique!,"I was hesitant, at first, but being a great fan of Catherine Deneuve and Fanny Ardant, how could I not see this film?!? Once I decided to rent ""8 Femmes"" I was not disappointed. In fact, I was most pleasantly surprised - the music, too, is a nice bonus. Isabelle Huppert gives a scene-stealing performance, and there is nothing bad to say about this film. See it, and enjoy!"
2,Great for a trip,I bought this movie to my 6 years old daughter see when we are on a trip. But she like so much that everywhere we go she take with her. It's a great movie.
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This is the most painful 85 minutes that you will ever sit through. The movie sucks. Nothing about it is funny, just stupid. I think I could make a better movie with my camera phone. stupid."
1,4.5 inch heal wrap up rhinestone sandal,"I've never had an issue with purchases from amazon before...this one looked ok at first but as I looked closer I realized that a few of the rhinestones were missing, I read the return label and it seemed too much of a hassle to return it. These were suppose to be my wedding shoes...and now I won't be able to wear them."
2,Thought provoking,When i started this book i had no idea that it would lead me to read the next four. two thumbs up.
1,Very hard to follow...,"Honsetly only read through the first few chapters. It was difficult to follow....the author jumped back and forth between timelines. If you can follow it, I'm sure there are some good facts there....but I couldn't keep up."
1,If you're 16+ don't bother,"These transformer movies are horrible. The special effects are the only good thing about these movies. The actors, especially the main actor have drab storylines, stupid dialogue, and the transformer voices are poor. Unless you're a kid, this movie is not for you."
1,Don't waste your time,I listened to all the reviews I read and let me tell you they are written by fanatics. I love the Scorps. The Scorps used to rock. I wish I could return this concert video in little pieces. The sound is junk the music is limp and the vocals are done. Don't waste you money on this video. Sorry Scorps. Your done..............
1,Abridged,"The info on this audio book, Death du Jour (received from bordeebook), didn't indicate that it is abridged. I didn't like it much, partly due to her poor use of similes, partly because I got tired of the plot development. I didn't listen to the last 45 minutes."
2,Better than I expected,"I picked this movie up at the suggestion of my friends, not expecting to enjoy it. Boy was I surprised! It's a sweet movie; the story of Lucy's accident and recovery touched my heart. Add a few(okay, a lot of) one-liners and great music, and you've got one good movie. Just don't watch it with the youngsters, the movie has a fair amount of sexual content."
1,Hmmm.,"Well, I guess if you've never heard this kind of stuff before then it's fine, but it certainly is not the future of music. Listen to Papalotl instead."
2,Very Pleased,Very pleased with the 3 I bought. Good looking with or without a neck tie.Nice cotton blend fabric.Great Price.
2,A classic,This story is a very good classic that sucks you right in. It has great morals and messages. A must-read.
1,"Ten Minutes of Action, Five Minutes of Drama, Two Hours and Twenty Minutes of Awkward Teenage Angst","I won't say that this movie doesn't have its moments, just that they are few and far between. And you know those horrible, horrible memories everyone grows up with, the kind that scream ""embarrassment"" at high volume when, a few years later, you are reminded of the fact that yes, you were stupid enough to say that in front of those people? This movie is chocked full of those moments."
1,junk,"junk, waste of money, very disappointed, even misleading as the packaging contains pictures of episodes that are not even in the collection"
1,Take a pass on this one,"We have two reference systems in the home plus digital or analog over ethernet feeds to all of the other rooms. Speakers tend to be high end, source material ranges from digital music fed to dac's or cd's. I have two AudioSource 100's, one in the kitchen driving Energy's and one that drives a set of B&W;'s on the porch.Totally devoid of musicality. This amp will kill any source signal you put in it. Compared to any amp we've had in the past 40 years, this is the worst. The sound has nothing going for it, 0 energy, no low end, sounds like it compresses music, no soundstage, no rhythm, just plain boring."
2,using it 1-2 times per day and works great,"The good:--makes awesome rice--makes excellent steel cut oatmeal--timer option--minimal cleaningThe bad:--no gaba rice option--steel cut oatmeal clogs the top if:----not made overnightThe ugly:--nothing, i love this cookerupdate:been using this cooker for several months, still works great, we've been eating less rice but still plenty of oatmeal"
2,This book was thought-provoking and informative.,"I read this book and finally began to understand all the things that my dad would never talk about concerning the war. The stories are well written and thought provoking. The very fact that these people came home and did their best to be good citizens and make good lives without complaining speaks volumes about that generation. Now we saw soldiers crying about having to leave their families during Desert Storm. Do we think it was any easier for the generation during WWII? This book shows us how ""me centered"" we are. Another thing, now soldiers came back from the Viet Nam or Desert Storm wars and blame everything on their military experience. The WWII generation sucked it up and went on with their lives. They got over it. Makes me sort of ashamed of the way my generation deals with life experiences."
1,Customer Beware!,"Purchasers should be aware that this book is a miniature and its approximate size is 3 1/2"" x 3 1/2""."
2,"More pricy, but nice to use","True, it is more expensive than non-Canon caps, but after all you are using it a hundred times on a photography day and it works the best (I have a $5 non-Canon one and every time I had to use it it felt cheap and flimsy). Just another small thing to enjoy your shooting more.One star off, as it still could be 30% cheaper."
1,Nineteen folktales of South and Central America,"This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I."
2,"Difficult, but all-around enjoyable","Count Dracula has married Queen Victoria, and vampirism is the hip new trend for anyone who wants to be anyone. A mysterious killer is cutting down young vampire prostitutes in the streets, and the police have received a letter claiming credit from someone who calls himself Jack the Ripper. If you enjoy classic vampire stories, mysteries, Victorian London, or just a really good story, it's worth taking a look.My only complaint is that the tangled threads of multiple viewpoint characters get confusing. There are quite a few characters to keep track of, each with their own agendas. Most of them are familiar from other works (the good Dr. Jekyll inspects a recent murder victim; when he is visited for further questioning, he's consulting with his friend Dr. Moreau), and there's a healthy appendix at the end that lists historical and fictional references by chapter, but it's still a lot to keep track of."
2,Good for turns in a small space,"These short curves are really a nice addition to your wooden railway system as they make it possible to create small and sharper turns than you can do with the normal curved track (33342). The downside of this track is that it may be a bit difficult for longer engines (like the mighty red battery-powered engine) to drive through the curves. However, if the tracks are laid without too many ""bumps"" at the connecting points the larger engines will manage to drive through it as well."
2,A Very Pleasant Story,Diane Lane gives a great performance in this romantic/fantasy driven movie. I know many people dream of going to another place to escape the pressures of daily life and this movie does that for you. If you like romantic movies in a far away land then this movie is for you.
1,What a waste of time!,"I am usually fond of mid-twentieth century classics such as this, so when I was assigned to read it for my ninth grade english class, I looked forward to enjoying it. However, I was disappointed to find that it is a horrible and tedious book."
1,Disapointed,"I can't believe this Great Film Has not been giventhe widescreen treatment it ,and we, deserve.Some extraswould be nice too."
1,no blow,I bought this because 2 other 12 volt ocilating fans I've had did not ocilate. This one seems to reliably ocilate but even though it spins the blade it does not seem to move the air. jUNK DON'T BUY
1,Hand pump does not have enough pressure,"Ball is ok, hand pump cannot produce enough pressure to fully inflate ball to proper pressure. Has strong plastic smell even after washing. Would not purchase another one"
1,Review of book,"I didn't care for this book at all - in fact, I stopped reading it several times because it droned on and on about the writer's depression - so much so, it made me depressed! I wanted to read about her recovery - and after more than half of the book behind me, I was still looking for that. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"
2,Short but deep,Steinbeck writes the beautifull yet sad tale of two men trying to find a place for themselves durring the Great Depression. I first read this book at the age of 13. I read it in one sitting (not hard to do as it is only around 110 pages) and then cried and cried. An excellent book for young adults as well as adults. It will move you.
1,Kindle Buyer Beware!,"Find another version for ebookery, or go hard copy on this one. The table of contents, like the print version, organizes Poe's work into general categories, but stops there. Absent is a listing of the stories themselves, which is available in the print version. Navigating to a particular story requires you to do a search. Penguin charges a premium for a poor publishing job here."
1,Waste of money,This book is the worst tutorial Illustrator book out there. It doesn't explain how or why. Not a good book for those new to Illustrator like I am.
1,Not the original Canon battery,"We were surprised and confused when opened up the Amazon shipping box. The battery has been removed from the retail packaging and wrapped in a bubble wrap with a seal labe said ""new"". When looked closely at the battery, it's obvious that this is not the same one as what we have in the camera. I'm not sure if $29.94 is a deal for a non-original battery. We strongly urge Amazon to faithfully update the product description, or this is considered a deceiving."
2,Clay Is Definitely The Man,"Excellent!! Lyrics, melody, heart and that VOICE. I love all of the tracks but ""The Way"" is the best song I've heard in years. It will be a #1 hit for Clay. Thanks Clay!"
1,Will not completely deflate,"I ordered 3 of these. They are sturdy, comfortable, and stay inflated. The electric motor in each easily and quickly inflates and (almost) deflates them. The height also makes them feel more like a real bed.However, if you want to completely deflate them for storage, that can be a real trick. I could never deflate any of them completely, so in frustration I cut one open to see what the problem is. A design flaw allows an internal plastic flap to cover the deflation port when they are almost empty. The more you try to vacuum or squeeze out air, the tighter the flap seals the port, sealing in the last bit of air.Now I know, and there's nothing I can do about it, but I feel better after attacking one with scissors..."
2,A dark comedy with a feel good ending,"Watched this movie on a whim and turned out better than what I thought. It is a dark, light-hearted comedy with a happy ending."
2,So Much Detail that the Story Come to Life,"I read this book a few years back but couldn't resist reviewing it now that I have an Amazon account.Jean Auel is one of my favorite authors. I have all her books in hardback. The reason I am so attached to these books is that the details she interweaves into the story line really brings it to life. The descriptions of the plants and their uses, the feel of living in a cave, these are the things make Clan of the Cave Bear great. I know the author does at least a year of research before each book and it really shows.The plight of Ayla, her constant feeling of being different and insufficient, her struggle to please those she loves, this is something everyone can relate to on some level. I look forward to diving into the Painted Caves very soon!"
1,OH NO CLAY,"Yes, there is no question about Clay's talent. That's a given. However, this album just doesn't show it. His singles were fabulous and then they disappoint us with this album. You can't even tell where one song ends and the next begins. It's all the same stuff. C'mon now~give the man the songs that he is so capable of delivering with spine tingling sensations!"
2,Great deal!,We've had good luck with Pampers and the Subscribe and Save program is a great deal. i really like that I can move the deliveries or cancel deliveries at any time.
2,GIVE THE GIRL HER PROPS,I KNOW ALOT OF YOU HATE MADONNA JUST BECAUSE SHE IS MADONNA. I HAVE BEEN A LIFE LONG FAN AND EVEN I WAS KINDA IFEY ABOUT HER DOING THIS BUT THIS IS A LADY MADE OF SHEER DETERMINATION TO DO THINGS RIGHT. SHE WORKED LIKE A MAD WOMEN TO GET HER VOICE IN CHECK AND SHE DID A GREAT JOB. SHE HAS NEVER SOUNDED BETTER. SHE HITS NOTES ON THIS SOUNDTRACK THAT I NEVER COULD IMAGINE HER DOING. NO SHE ISNT BROADWAY TRAINED LIKE THE ORIGINAL STAGE VETS BUT SHE DOES A FANTASTIC JOB. I LUV THE ORIGINAL ASWELL BUT SHE DOES ADD A CERTAIN EMOTION THAT WAS MISSING FROM PATTI AND JULIES PERFORMANCES. SHE EVEN WAS TRAINED BY PATTI LUPONES VOICE TEACHER. SO YOU HATERS JUST OPEN YOUR MINDS A LITTLE AND GET PASS THE POP ICON THING. THE GIRL DOES HAVE TALENT.
1,Won't work in Dimage 7i,"Inserting this card in my new Minolta Dimage 7i (digital camera), I get an ""Unable to use card"" error. The card is evidently incompatible with the 7i. Others have had the same experience. See the digital camera forums.Check the compatibility chart at minoltausa.com before you buy!"
2,Thank you!!,"thanks for the super fast shipping, this dress really is super comfortable!! thanks to the other that wrote their reviews, it really helped when deciding weather or not to purchase this dress!"
2,Best album ever,"This album has got to be my favorurite album in the world - from my favourite band in the world. They absolutely rock, the music has great lyrics and meaningful music. Recommend it if you like Linkin Park and Slipknot!"
2,Amelia Bedalia,"A fun book, my daughter loves Amelia Bedalia. As we live in Spain and she only hears English from me, it's a great way for her to learn the double meanings of many words."
1,An insult to marines,"As soon as this movie started and I saw ""WWE"" on my TV screen I said ""This is gonna suck."" And it didn't disappoint. This movie sucked! Bad! It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The story didn't make a lick of sense. You got these bad guys who kidnap a random woman whose husband turns out to be Rambo. The marine chases after these guys, killing them one by one. You'd think they'd just give him back his wife. She means nothing to them. Give her back and they can go on with their criminal business. But no. They hold on to her.The marine runs/jumps in slow motion away from explosions at least 4 times in this movie. This movie is filled with every single action movie clichÃ© and it didn't thrill in the slightest. It wasn't even bad enough to be good. It was just bad. It stunk."
1,Same material in yet another format...,"Basically this book is taken from where almost all ""magical psalms"" books are taken from and so is a copy with modified information. I say 'copy' because it includes the 'misspellings' of the original. If you want the original, then check out Joseph Peterson's ""Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses"" which has it in the appendix. This book is probably cheaper than Peterson's, but it includes practices with candles with the psalms which Peterson's version of the original does not (since the original does not use candles)."
1,This book was dumb,"I know that saying the book is dumb nullifies all the hard work put into it, but I just did not like it. Sure the main idea and a well written summary makes the book as a whole good, it doesn't help the actual context one bit which was very hard to follow and comprehend."
1,Good only for the first few days,"So i purchased these weights a few days ago and they appeared very comfortable. But after a few days, the cloth started to expand and then sand started to seep through. This product was only good for teh first few days of purchase."
1,CF Card Error with Canon G3 like some other reviews,"After a few uses, I got CF Card Error during a function at home with my Canon G3. Going to try if I can get a replacement. Even with that, I don't think I will be using this for any important events.When I buy a card next time, I have to read each and every review and see how many people with G3 got into trouble."
2,Best book on Economics for the general reader,"This is an excellent introduction to Economics. Hazlitt was a clear writer, and his analysis of fallacious economic thought is very informative. You don't have to be a student of Economics - this is a book that can benefit every reader. I just wish more of our politicians had read this book."
1,terrible,"The only good song is Grillz, Nelly strait up bombed on the sweitsuit cds plain and simple. Nelly sells to female fans period. He needs to get some country grammar action again. Paul Wall, ALi and Gipp saved that song Grillz."
1,BORING!,"I have enjoyed all the Fleetwood Mac albums and thought this video would provide excellent sound tracks from their album Rumors. Unfortunately, both me and my guests were extremely disappointed by boring commentary mixed in with partial sound tracks..... A book would have been more entertaining."
1,Scorpions Live at Wacken open air 2006,"Be careful. Had to return. Did not play on my DVD player or computer. The back cover said NTSC Region 0. However, the DVD said PAL Region 9. I could see the picture, but there was no sound. Wait for the US version!!"
1,Lassie fans are learning not to get their hopes up,"When I first heard there was an upcoming Lassie release I got my hopes up. I hoped it was the beginning of proper season sets of the classic Lassie series. Of course, like most Lassie fans, I've learned to hope for the best but expect the worst. There's not many details on this listing yet, but from the cast list it appears to be the 2005 movie. So, instead of what I was hoping for, Lassie fans get a release of a recent movie, which is already available on DVD(ASIN: B000ICL3ME), with an impostor playing Lassie. Please Classic Media, start releasing full season sets of the classic series with complete uncut episodes in chronological order!!!"
1,OK,The book was not that bad-but i wouldn't strongly recommend it. It was a bit weird for my liking.
1,I'm haunted by the memory of seeing this sorry movie,"This movie, despite having a truly excellent sound design, is just another hokey Hollywood special effects show. Shirley Jackson's novel, quite possibly the finest haunted house story ever written, is tossed aside in favor of easy to communicate cliches and stock shocks (I guessed the BIG SURPRISE TWIST ENDING about three minutes into it and was waiting for all the other stupid characters to catch on). The worst movie of 1999 belongs in the same company as Golden Turkey winners Orca, the Killer Whale, The Swarm, and Exorcist 2: The Heretic."
2,very helpful,I have found this to be a very helpful workbook to go with Que Tal text. The answers are in the back for self check. It incorporates the vocab of the chapter with the grammar covered.
1,Don't buy this scanner,"I was very excited to buy this scanner and was pleased with its size and weight. However, if you have a Vista operating system, like I do, IT WILL NOT WORK! The company told me that they stopped selling this product over a year ago and there are no driver updates available for this product. If you have an older computer and an older operating system this product might work for you. But as for me it was a waste of money!"
2,Great Collaboration of Products!!!,"This a great combo of cleaning/care products for my car. It was exactly what I was looking for. If you know what all these products are, then you will understand this is a great purchase. Everything included is really all that is needed for a perfectly clean car. The only thing missing is the bucket, water, and a good means of drying (I used one of those super absorbent towels rather than a chamois)."
2,Just Perfect,"It was just as I expected, arrived aearly and it was as they said it will be, it's just perfect"
2,Great on leaks!,"I've used pampers for my son. This second time around I've found that I'm still usin pampers but just a different make. They keep my kids dry day and night. Baby dry diapers can really hold a full diaper, especially when your on the go. My daughter has a bit of a waist and these diapers really stretch with her, yet protect against leaks."
2,Getting Rid of Bradley,This earlier work of Jennifer Crusie's is a fun quick read. The characters are witty and entertaining. Dog lovers will also get a chuckle from Ms. Crusie's descriptions of pets. The story is predictable which allows the reader to relish in the delightful dialogue.
2,good,I thought it was a good movie. I grew up watchig transformers. Its nice to see it brought to the big screen.
2,Great Movie,"My only complaint is the length of time it took to arrive. Could not use a gift as planned. Somehow, shipping needs to be speedier!!!"
2,Clay is fantastic,I love all the songs on this album and that is saying a lot for me because I am very critical of much of the music that is out there these days. Clay sang his heart out on these songs and I especially liked The Way and I Will Carry You. I hope some of the other songs besides Invisible get some airplay. Love that Clay.....my American Idol.
2,great,it was fun educational in side is a whole new world where you learn to spend save and shop and I gave it to my sister and she loved it you can also go online at neopets.com and if you have a neopet accont you get a rare virtule item.
1,Can't believe I gave this 2 stars,"I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan I'll watch almost anything once. This is one of those one watch movies. A huge disappointment and not enjoyable at all. The first half of the movie is spent trying to make you lust after Huntington-Whiteley. She is so one dimensional that she's impossible to like, let alone think she's appealing. There was zero chemistry between Huntington-Whiteley and LaBeouf. They wasted half the film trying to show how LaBeouf could be the worst bumbler of all time and how everyone knew it. Somebody in the studio obviously doesn't understand the Sci-Fi audience."
2,Outstanding Bed,"I've owned 2 beds for over 2 years now and both beds have held up extremely well considering the amount of constant use they've had. One of beds I actually sleep on daily (more comfortable than my regular bed). I had it over 2 years before one of the inner baffels gave way a few weeks ago. I immediatly ordered another bed without hesitation. Very comfortable and super easy to use, with the built in pump, it's a snap to set up and deflate. Love this bed!!"
2,Julie Garwood's books are all keepers,I have this book on order. Of course I haven't read it yet but I have all of her books. I read them at least 2or 3 times a month. Keep up the excellent work. Thank you for the stories that women can daydream to.
2,A Wake Up Call,"I enjoyed this book very much. Saw a lot of myself in the pages. Some good and some bad, I think all females should read as rite of passage. Will enlighten and encourage a different behavior. A book that should be read and passed on to others."
2,this book makes it very easy to understand the writing in this book.,this book makes it so much easier to understand the context of this book. there are definitions of some of the words that are almost impossible to understand. there are character explainations as well. very good version for a student!
2,"GREAT,GREAT,GREAT!!!!!",There should be a warning label cautioning drivers not to listen and drive. You'll get lost in the beat and end up with a ticket! FIVE STARS ISN'T ENOUGH !!
1,iz,igot iz and i liked it for a few days. i thought it was cool. then it got boring and i never played with it again. now i am going to get my money back and buy soemthing else
2,Incredible,"This is my favorite of Jamaica Kincaid's, which of course is saying a lot. It is simply amazing. More complex and involved than her usual writing, it is a ""hard"" read, but definitely worth it. Also, if you ever have a chance to hear her read, it is amazing, and you will never read her in the same way again."
1,"Good idea, bad execution","This is the first book by Alastair Reynolds I have read. I must say I was disappointed. The idea behind the book is interesting. But Reynolds' writing is pedestrian at best. The pacing is terrible. The characterizations are thin. The book drags for hundreds of pages, then falls apart in the last 50. It seems like the editor got nervous at the length and told AR to wrap it up quick-smart.I would read other books by AR if they were given to me, but I won't be buying any others."
2,It works!,"I used the emu oil faithfully over the course of several weeks and had very noticeable benefits. Very fine lines vanished (really!) and deeper lines diminished noticeably. My husband even commented on the difference. Further, my complexion is pinkish from rosacea, and the emu oil took some (not all) of the pink from my skin. Finally, the skin on my cheeks had been inexplicably rough as well, and the emu oil smoothed my skin. This is a terrific product that absolutely lived up to its claims."
2,So good I always own two copies...,"I like to keep a second copy of this book handy in case I need to recommend it to someone. I don't ever want to be without it. The women in this story all live on in my mind/heart long after the last time I read it. I was not crazy about Ellen Foster when Oprah went on and on about it...I always thought she should have chosen this book.I guess if you're ""forced"" to read this for school I would recommend that you have a quick attitude adjustment first. Having been stuck reading some seriously dry assignments long ago in the stone ages, how I WISH a story like this would have been put in my life when I was younger! I can't understand a word of the negative reviews here.It's like chocolate.I understand how people might not like brussel sprouts even though I do. I don't understand how anyone can possibly NOT adore chocolate. That's what Charms for the Easy Life is for me."
2,So Much Better Than the Dregs From the Bulk Bin,"This nutritional yeast is the same stuff that you can find in the bulk bins at many health food stores. The upside is that it hasn't been pawed through by a zillion shoppers before you and the canister that it comes in is so much sturdier and easier to store in your pantry than the flimsy plastic bags found in most bulk food aisles.The reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is that it is the ""small flake"" nutritional yeast instead of the ""large flake"" that I prefer. Plus, although it has a good ""cheesy"" flavor and is great for using when making vegan dishes or as a topping for popcorn, it does have a very slightly bitter flavor to it that in my experience, some other brands of nutritional yeast don't seem to have."
2,the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,in this game other than the fighting style the animated cut scenes have the best graphics. If your a fire emblem fan youmust buy this or just trying something new rent the game atblockbuster or at gamefly.com
1,Yawn! Wake me up at the end.,"I was excited to come across Lene Gammelgaard's book as I love to read about women who share my taste for adventure. Imagine how disappointed I was to find that Ms. Gammelgaard could not write about anything outside of herself. Yes, I know it is a personal account of climbing Everest, but her trip was not a solo ascent. From her account though, you would think no one else was around. Okay, perhaps that is a slight exaggeration, but I was pretty tired of Ms. Gammelgaard far before the end of this book. Additionally, her writing style is quite disjointed and distracting. I find it difficult to believe the claim that she has ""been a journalist,"" unless you understand that to include anyone who has, perhaps, simply kept a journal.If you want to get a feel for being a woman and climbing, better to try Stacy Allison or Ruth Anne Kocour. You will get much more rich detail from either of those, along with more of a sense of the community of climbing."
1,Disappointed in California,"I eagerly awaited the release of this album, but was quite disappointed when I heard it. Other than This is the Night, the remaining songs are very plain and quite forgettable, and you will have a difficult time not skipping ahead to the next song in hopes of something better. I can't help but feel that the album was rushed to market, and that in doing so, good song choices were not made. The songs simply do not showcase Clay's singing ability and range, and many of their lyrics and melodies leave a lot to be desired. I wish I could have written a wonderful review, but unless your an absolute Clay diehard fanatic, I think that you will be disappointed with this album."
2,Sensational silk!,"I bought these silk pajamas for my husband for our anniversary, and he LOVED them. They're exactly as described - cool when it's warm out, and warm when it's cool out. He wears them all the time and says they're very comfortable."
2,Easiest networking ever!,"Makes TiVo networking a snap! I tried several other adapters first, only to find that none were compatible. (That cost you a star, TiVo! Yes, I consulted the hardware list...) This item is well-made and attractive as gadgets go. For ease of setup, I highly recommend this adapter."
2,Excellent fun!,"The Ark of Truth was an o.k. movie. I liked it because it is Stargate and because I wanted to see the actors again. Continuum, on the other hand, is superb. The story is great, the actors are fabulous - that's what SG1 was all about a couple of years ago."
1,Positivly Atrocious! Boring beyond reason!,"This book is boring,terribly written and dryer than a year old cracker. Saying that J.K Rowling plagurised this is a sheer insult to a great writer. My advice to the writer is take a little more time to actually write a good book instead of tring to sue other people! Seriously, I felt like a genuis trying to read Barney's play time! Take my advice and save some innocent tree in a forest somewhere, and don't buy this book! If you want to read this ridiculous excuse for a book visit a library!"
2,Johnny France knows no fear!,"I've know Johnny France since he was a young man. Without his dogged determination, these two killers might not have ever been captured. Don Nichols is still in prison and most likely will never get paroled. This book tells fascinating tale almost too strange to believe in these modern times. Great reading!!"
2,Real Trinidadian Flavors,"If you've ever eaten ""doubles"" on the street in Trinidad and wondered how to reproduce that delightful flavor at home, this is the book to use. The recipes are true native specialties, described so anyone can enjoy them."
1,i want my money back,"Most likely one of the worst movies i have ever seen! I went to see this movie with about 5 or 6 friends, when it was over, we all wanted our money back! The movie is not funny at all. Believe me i love adam sandler but this isnt even a comedy, there are alot of sad parts in it, but they label it as a comedy. All this movie actually is happens to be is a fairy tale for little kids, huge waste of money. If you want to see a real adam sandler comedy wait for anger management or rent happy gilmore."
2,Clay is...The Measure of a Man,"I have waited patiently for this CD to come out and I have not been disappointed at all. Every song on this CD is awesome. Clay is truly an amazing singer with soul and compassion flowing through his voice. You will not be disappointed in purchasing this CD. Now I can't wait for Clay to go on tour across America. America has voted, through the record sales, who the real American Idol should have been."
1,AMAZON HAS HELD UP THIS ORDER FOR MONTHS - B E W A R E !,If you're looking to order this book I'd recommend looking elsewhere. I ordered this book over 2 months ago and Amazon has never shipped it. It is not out-of-print so I don't know why this has occurred. Amazon claims they are out-of-stock. But how long does it take to order a book that is currently in-print??? Amazon really dropped the ball on this one.
2,Brilliant.,"Noone delivered a lyric better than Carmen and no singer understood Monk as well. Instrumental work and recording quality are also excellent. If you think the Great Songbook recordings ended with Ella, think again."
1,Great Movie But Awful Sound Quality by KINO,"This is one of those great film noir classics and Crawford gives one of her great performances. However, all of this is marred by the poor sound quality by Kino. I had to turn up the volume on my TV all the way to hear it. Crawford (in her last Oscar nominated role) and this superb film deserve much better."
1,Had to return due to allergy reaction!,"Be aware these diapers may cause an irritation on sensitive skin, to my son it was like he was burnt on his tummy, genitals and bottom. Each changing time was hell and cries like I was peeling off his skin. I switched for huggies natural cotton and evrything is fine now."
2,Great for kids!,"As usual, Thomas and Friends are entertaining in all the best ways for kids! Good lessons and good fun."
1,No idea what this is,"This is something that's been on my list for months and I have no idea what it is, it sends me to a non-existent link."
2,Religion and profits,"An excellent scholarly book. Great detail and very in depth analysis. Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy, not just Islam. That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises, for most of its adherents, Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life, dictating every aspect of it. Unavoidably, there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements, but he does more than that, he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end, he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it. Writing is very formal, not the easiest read and surley apporpriate only for the truly intersted in the general topic, but it was well worth it for this reader."
2,Glad to see SR has gone to Velcro!,"This is a great shoe. My daughter seems to like it, so it must be comfortable. The extreme plus is that Stride Rite has moved from the buckle to velcro -- finally! Easy to put on and take off."
1,Slow going,Hardly anything past exotic stepcercise playing at your local gym save the oft-cited and featured-elsewhere PNG.
2,Difficult Parents quality,"This text was in good shape, no bent pages, marks, etc. It also came quickly before I needed it for my class...and I'm based in China too. So was a good purchase overall!"
2,an absolute masterpiece,"I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^"
2,Defining moments,"This set of stories is definitely among the best works of fiction ever to reach the printed page! The most important characters such as Captain America, Silver Surfer, and Thanos are handled flawlessly. The entire first five sections just keep building the suspense and you are wondering the entire time ""how are the good guys going to win?"" and we find out in the sixth. This book shows why Marvel comics are the best because we care about the characters. The book also has Captain America's defining moment: at the end of the battle only Cap stands. He walks up to the God-like Thanos. His shield is destroyed and Thanos brings his fist towards him. Captain America stands there, defiance to the last. The look in his eye, captured perfectly by Ron Lim says it all. In short, if you are a fan of comics, or even if you aren't and want to see why so many of us feel like the characters are friends and, in some cases like Captain America, even good role models, then buy this book!"
1,Go Haunt Yourself!,"This movie stinks. It's like watching a WCW Pay per view from that time. This film was ruined by cartoon ghosts,dumb subplots and a Disney-style good vs evil storyline. The acting is not that good. It also has too many pointless cast members & moments. The effects are laughable to the 4th power. The story is childish like See Spot Run. It's buildup is soo backwards. The worst part is when Owen Wilson gets his head cut off by that lion's head statue swinging by. I give this film a -0 out of 10."
1,Don't waste your time if you don't absolutely have to.,"I read this for a college course. If this is the best the world had to offer at the time (Pulitzer Prize winner), then I fear for this nation. It was confusing at the beginning (conflicting ideas presented - it speaks as if it were the beginning of the world, but the characters find ancient items). And the story line is jumbled.Personally, I found no enjoyment in the reading of it. The symbolizism that we were supposed to find was buried so deeply that I had to research it on the internet. I finally found a few things written on the symbolism, had to re-read most of the book to find it, and consummed quite a bit of headache medicine to get through it.It was far too long for what it had to say...which wasn't much. Never have I burned a book in my life. I took special joy in planning an overnight camping trip for the sole purpose of watching it burn."
2,It's Inexpensive and it Works,"I own two of these chargers, which even with shipping charges are a fraction of the cost of those available in retail stores...even discount stores...and I don't see any difference between the performance of these and the expensives ones."
2,It does its job.,"There isn't a whole lot to say. for the price I'm pleased with my purchase, it does it's job and looks good while doing it."
1,TERRIBLE ATTEMPT AT GOTHIC HORROR,"""The Haunting"" is certainly one of the worst films I've seen. While it starts off promisingly, the sets and special effects become so mind numbingly overdone that the thread of the original story is lost completely. It is replaced by a story that is not only derivitive and banal, but laugably contrived as well. This movie proves that even with a classic novel and a classic movie, a remake can totally botch its rendering beyond all recognition. Recommended for the film audience that prefers style far above substance."
2,"Exceptional film - genuinely funny, moving and entertaining","Genuinely funny and moving - exceptional film.This is an exceptional film that shows that no matter what life throws at you, the human spirit can survive and make a comeback. I love films that show you the inner strength of the human spirit and peoples faith. The film is genuinely affecting - it is funny, very moving and it looks exceptional on a big screen. Most of all though this film entertains without resorting to cliches and melodrama. Diane Lane is exceptional and deserves Oscar recognition for creating such a three dimensional and believable heroine. The acting from everyone is first rate and the direction is fresh and infectious. An exceptional film!"
2,New Technology!,"This is new technology, what can we say? It might have its occasional bugs (not being able to get songs in a few days) but these are things that can be overlooked. Its new for crying out loud! The best way to get these bugs ironed out is by supporting the product and giving Sony feedback. The interface of this product is excellent and simple...a button and a tiny LCD screen. If you don't know how to use this then...technology isn't your buddy I guess. As far as coverage and the speed in which certain radio stations provide feedback is the sole responsiblity of that station for the most part (most stations take 24 hours to get a song. others might take maybe 10 minutes or so), and NPR support would be very much appreciated. Not every location on the surface of the earth is supported (yet) but as far as I'm concerned an e-mail request to Sony could help to do the trick. Overall, the product is great and it is a great Sony investment."
2,You'll ease your stress if you use the advice in this book,"Jim and John have a wonderful way of making you feel like you're sitting down at your kitchen table with a bankruptcy attorney who only has your best interests at heart. They don't pull any punches, and sometimes what they tell you isn't what you really want to hear, but you know they're giving you solid advice. Your anxiety level will plummet if you are thinking of filing bankruptcy and are looking for someone to hold your hand through the process.Paula Langguth Ryan, Author, Bounce Back From Bankruptcy, 3rd Edition"
2,Java's best friend,Exellent quality. Does the job of keeping hot coffee hot throughout the day. On off switch is a plus also.
2,You can't go wrong with this....,"There is something about Amelia Bedelia that captures the attention of children, my 7 year old son can't get enough of her. If you want your child to discover the joys of laughter and fun in a book then you have to buy this!"
1,Too many cooks,The book had a plot line that meandered like a dog in a fire hydrant warehouse. The characters were as flat as the paper they were writen on. The authors collaboration worked as well as a mixture of a heavy smoker in a fireworks factory. It is very obvious it is a collaboration and it needs the hand of a better editor. If I had bought the book instead getting it at the library I would be demanding my money back for getting such a good example of why popular fiction is looked down upon. 1 star is being generous. I enjoyed other works by the authors and am severly disapointed in this collaboration.
2,"The best book you should read, but don't in High School","Across the country there is a travesty going on. High School teachers are requiring students to read Animal Farm by George Orwell. By the same author there is a much finer example of satire and the multiple levels Orwell attached to each of his books. Nineteen Eighty-Four is simply one of the best books written this century. It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom. If anyone doesn't come out a Libertarian after reading this book, they didn't read it close enough. One of the many books that will be on classic reading lists for centuries to come."
1,Good for a laugh,"I heard about this book, so I wanted to read it to see if it was as funny and stupid (unintentionally) as I heard.I was not disappointed. Few things in life are free, and sex is defintely not among them.The perfect coda to this book is that the couple got divroced several years after publishing this book. You can't make this stuff up."
2,It was a fiction book...,"I just finished to read Three Lions Roar.It is amazing! All times, dates, places for England National team became true. Please read the book and check the England's games. You will see how a fiction book comes to reality.Yes. I beleive it. This book is the Bible of England's fans.""England fans! Have the book. Keep it close to you. It will happen...""England will be the World Cup Champion again."
1,"Good book, bad copy.","My problem isn't with the story, it's with this copy. If the character is reading something, you aren't. Every single time the author says that someone is reading something, it immediately cuts ahead to when they put the document away. For example, the entirety of the Legend of the Baskerville Curse is cut out, the article with the last Sir Baskerville's cause of death is cut out, a letter to the new Sir Baskerville is cut out... the list goes on. I've had to find another copy to fill in the blanks. The book is worth reading, but I'd spend the money to get an edition that actually has the whole story."
2,Awesome CD,"Clay is an amazing new artist and this CD proves that he has versatiliy,range, and heart. His voice is so strong and he evokes so much passion into his songs. Also there are songs to fit anyone's mood whether your happy (When you say you love me, perfect day, invisible, shine) or sad ( No more sad songs) or feel in love (measure of a man, run to me, i will carry you). This CD was worth the wait and worth every dollar!"
1,Anesthesia for the gifted,"I checked this book out of the public library in hopes of gaining some insight into the many kinds of difficulties an adult faces upon learning of his/her giftedness. Instead, this book was full of Oprah-like perky advice, sprinkled liberally with sleep-inducing anecdotes about ""Heather"" and ""James"" et cetera.The author does not have the gifted reader in mind with this book. It is overstuffed with fluff and not enough substance. I have yet to find a book on gifted adults that speaks to us at our own level of intellect and cogently outlines issues and strategies that we face with our unique brains."
1,"If you like Tozer, you won't like this!","This is man-worship at its most blatant! The Tozer quotes are good, of course, but they are much better read in their context. The compiler's have seen a way to make a quick buck on Tozer's popularity and the page titles are crass, tasteless and irrelevant. The Bible verses that are supposed to associate with each quote bear little relevance, and add nothing to the quote. This is a waste of money at any price! We find on the back that this booklet is part of a series. Others in the series include Moody, Wesley, Luther, and ... Larry Burkett (whoever HE is!) Please save your money and time. This one ended up straight in the bin. To me it is worse than pure secularism and borders on blasphemy! It's sick!"
1,Childrens Humor Not Suitable For Children.,"I want to say first that I am an Adam Sandler fan. I loved him on SNL, I have enjoyed him in everything from ""Billy Madison"" to ""Punch-Drunk Love"". So with that in mind, I had high hopes for ""Eight Crazy Nights"". To say it was a let down would be an understatement. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory.The only thing remotely close funny is the old man named Whitey. He has a few lines that might warrant a slight chuckle. Sandler's Davey Stone character is so annoying, you will probably be tempted to turn off the movie within the first 10 minutes. If you don't, you'll be treated to jokes about hairy butts, a woman with three breasts, a man eating a jock strap and deer licking frozen feces. Sounds appealing, doesn't it?I am sure some diehard Sandler fans think this is funny, but I don't. Hopefully his first animated movie will be his last."
1,"Lots of Basset photos, short on Basset specifics.","I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset. I enjoyed the MANY photos of Bassets, but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in ANY general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff. It looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed-specific details and lots of photos and -- presto! -- a new book.Less than 30 pages (of 224) are specific to Bassets."
2,A Necessity for any Lovebird Owner,"Do not purchase a Lovebird until you read this book! This book is filled with important information. There is so much that I would have been completely ignorant to if I had not purchased this book. It helped my find the right cage, told me about dangerous toys, first aid, different species, etc. This book contains everything, if you only want to buy one book on lovebirds, make it this one. This book talks about things you would never think of, it is truly a wonderful and informative book. You can tell that the author loves lovebirds, and cares for their well-being. I am so impressed with this book, that if I decide to get another bird one day, I will turn to the same collection. I am looking forward to the arrival of my first baby lovebird, and because of this book, I feel confident and at ease that I can provide a safe and loving home for my bird."
1,lost settings,"Works great most of the time. BUT, keeps losing settings thus my internet drops. I have to reinstall drivers every couple of days."
1,Heavy and Stiff,"I'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price. I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these. The boots were fairly heavy, stiff and narrow. I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me. I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable, flexible and light with good sole traction."
1,Inexpensive junk.,"I want to be sure to let all of the Amazon members know that this DVD would not play in my DVD player. I purchased three Hitchcock films from this distributor and only one of the three DVDs actually played. This one didn't, so buyer beware!"
2,"Great, encouraging read!","Loved it! Gives you great insight on the fundamentals of living a progressive life, ""The ultimate self-help book,"" even for those not seeking one"""
1,"Less then one year, Issues already","I purchased this less then one year ago, already the buttons are less responsive. The biggest problem that I have is that it does not play the songs correctly any more. I can hear the music and sometimes the back round singing but not the main singing. This started out as a periodic problem as I was running but now is almost all the time.I am very disappointed in this player."
2,Stayed up all night reading it,"This is a terrific oral history of the show. Gives you a sense of how it got off the ground, the insane competition for performers and writers to get sketches into the show, and gossipy stuff like politics, obnoxious hosts, and drug use. Reflections on the deaths of Belushi, Gilda, Farley, and Hartman are tremendously moving. I started this book at about 9:00 p.m., did not put it down until 6:30 a.m. the next morning."
1,It's not a story I'd like to hear again.,"I was expecting this movie to be like Eternal Sunshine or Garden State, a youthful drama. The lead in the movie was this entitled New York brat that checked himself into a mental hospital because he had a little stress from his prep school. Give me a break. I was hoping that by the end of the movie he would introspect a bit and find out that he was just being melodramatic, but instead the movie was biased to his point of view. The movie was not believable and the characters were not developed well at all."
1,"Don't Get It, Don't Care","Almost one-half way through this so-called mystery, I had to put it down. Perhaps you had to be British to care about whether Richard III killed his nephews. There seems to be more engaging historical mysteries. And what about the use of research as a device to tell a mystery tale? It simply did not work. Perhaps she could have written a history book instead? I didn't get it. Also, I doubt if I will read anything else by Tey."
2,Genius,"If there was any question of whether Nietzsche was an absolute genius, these two books will prove it. His wit, enthusiasm, courage, and extreme energy will keep you enthralled in his arguments. These are the two works by Nietzsche that give him his reputation as an extremist and genius."
1,Horrible Scans,I picked up this device to replace a ten year old HP Deskjet & a Canon scanner.It didn't print as well as the old Deskjet & the picture scans were horrible with lines in the image & it didn't seem to have enough gray levels as b/w pictures were clipped
1,Not impressed,"My husband bought these by accident and I was glad to see them go. We normally use Pampers Swaddlers and Pampers Baby-Dry do not come close to comparing.While using these, my daughter had a few accidents (I will be fair and say that a couple of those could have been as a result of human error) and they do not appear to be nearly as durable.Unfortunately, I would not feel comfortable recommending these... spend the extra money and go for the Swaddlers."
2,great material hampered by poor layout,"Somewhere in this great history book there's a game. The authors have definitely done their homework in studying the culture of late 16th century Japan. They've also got a great filmography and bibliography at the back. As far as content is concerned, Sengoku sets the bar quite high for historical RPGs. The actual conversion of this historical information into a playable game is, however, a bit awkward. The book is also seriously hampered by the amateurish artwork and layout reminiscent of RPGs of 30 years ago. Still, I've worn the cover off my copy of the book so its obviously a worthwhile read."
2,excellent vendor,eargels replaced old and lost ones that came with my blue tooth. they fit well and got ere quicker than expected.
1,Thumbs down,"Smallville 9 is a loser the entire season, not merely a few episodes. ""Kneel Before Zod"" is a thorougly unlikeable character; I think I would dislike even the person behind the portrayal, as the British accent is just so totally alienating. Season Nine is the ""chick-flic"" year: close-up on Zoe's recovery from those awful awful episodes with the mumbler Jimmy Olsen and the whiner David Bloom; and, of course, the heavy panting of the sexually-starved Lois Lane.I am ready to admit that Smallville lost its vitality by the end of season 7."
1,"Neat pictures, not much info","The title would lead one to believe that this book would help explain the foundation and workings of the Mormon faith. This is not the case. The limited text supplies the reader with just a basic explanation of what is being depicted in the photo. This is a good book for someone just interested in getting a superficial intro to this belief system, but nothing more."
2,A must for Fortean buffs,"Believe It or Not? Well, frankly, I don't believe all of it, though I'm sure those folks in West Virginia saw something mighty interesting. But in all the lengthy annals of Fortean/ supernormal/ paranoia-lit journalism, Keel does stand out as an author with an above-average storytelling ability. He also has the ability to not take himself entirely seriously, a trait often sorely lacking in the genre. With all that and a trans-phenomenon Grand Unified Theory of Weird Stuff to offer, this book is definitely worth checking out for those interested in the field."
1,Dehydrated.........dying rapidly.,"Listening to this album is just like putting on the thickest sweatsuit you can find and going for a really long run in africa. Dehydrated and dying rapidly. Nelly helps with this dehydration of hip hop by constantly creating infantile BS songs. I am sick of this monotonous, commercial, ignorant so called ""hip hop"". When will the zombies and sheep get tired of hearing the same song over and over and over again? Avoid this rehash of Sweat and suit as if it is a newly found strand of AIDS. Shakespeare?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?! WTF!!!!!!!!! LOL......if shakespeare wrote his plays like nelly writes his lyrics, the masses would've first stoned him to the point of death and then burned him at the stake."
1,Save your money!,"As a student of advanced massage therapy, I thought it would be great to have a ""pocket"" guide to help me remember the names and movements of the muscles. Unfortunately this book is so flimsy and dinky, it might have been moderately helpful to a junior high school science student. The illustrations are pretty good but nowhere near the detail that a serious Kinesiology student would need."
2,Timeless,"I love these books and I've started one of my nieces on the little critter series which she is loving. Especially when she sees a small mouse of something in the corner of the picture, she thinks it's really cute and funny."
2,Ease of Use!!,"TIVO locked upon install, but chatted with tech support and they provided me a code to get it unlocked. Other than that, operates well, no complaints. Would recommend if you want to have a TIVO set up without having a bunch of ethernet cables ran to it. Can attest that this DOES work with TIVO HD Premiere!! Don't spend extra on the 'G' unless you absolutely want to, this works just fine!!!"
1,Thought I was missing more than this...,"I don't own the box set but, if this is the best of the box then I'm not missing much. I really like Nirvana but there really just aren't many winners here especially since this is suppose to be the pick of the litter from ""With the lights out"".There are a few solid tracks here but I just expected more..."
2,Great historical fiction for young adults,I read a lot of young adult historical fiction as a kid and this was one I read over and over. I think I just liked the characters.
2,Not quite Gone with the Wind.,"It was interesting to read The Foxes of Harrow again, as a ""senior citizen, since I was only in my early teens the first time I read...and enjoyed...the book. It is quite sensual, considering the year it was written. It has held up fine during the years. I probably understood the nuances better as an adult than as a teenager. Frank Yerby was a brilliant writer, and in this book he presents a balanced view of what white slave owners and their slaves faced during that pre-civil war era. I couldn't help comparing it with Gone With the Wind as I read it."
1,Beware this game,"There's a reason Gamespot gave this game a 2.1 out of 10.This game should never have gotten through Nintendo quality assurance. It's buggy -- you can't even get through Moria without the game freezing. And that doesn't mention all the problems with item cloning, invisible characters, music cutting out, and impossible quests.Even if the game was bugfree, it's awful. Combats take forever (and aren't any fun, since your characters never hit), and the best parts of the book are skipped over, like Weathertop and Amon Hen. Moving your character on screen is like steering a drunk elephant. Seriously.If you're looking for a good Lord of the Rings experience, buy the PS2 Fellowship version (skip the Xbox one), or EA's Two Towers games (either GBA or PS2)."
2,Excellent Early 20th Century Science Fiction,"Once you accept the mumbo-jumbo elements of how Civil War veteran John Carter is transported to Mars, you can settle back and appreciate the remarkable fantasy world that Edgar Rice Burroughs describes. In a driving narrative that never lags, Burroughs succeeds in creating a multi-layered society rife with racial animosity and social unrest. Carter becomes the igniting spark, the focal point for societal change at all levels. This book is actually the first of a trilogy. Books two and three are ""The Gods of Mars"" and ""Warlord of Mars"" respectively. They are all excellent - so good you'll have trouble believing that they were written nearly a hundred years ago."
1,THIS IS ATROCIOUS!,"my God! this actually gets zero stars!!! how can anyone listen to this schlock?!?! clay aiken sounds exactly like the backstreet crossed with whitney houston. a CD full of sorry sounding pop hooks and soppy balladry is just absolutely aweful! if you want some good pop hooks and ballads, then get simon and garfunkle instead. and if you feel like some soppy balladry then get david bowie's ""hunky dory""...just make sure you pass on this true piece of crap of an album...seriously, this sucks really really bad"
2,Doolittle is Doing a LOT!,"First time ever reviewing for Amazon, although I've bought plenty. Why bother? Because Jerome Doolittle's Body Scissor's is worth the read and the write. If you enjoy Crais, Parker et al, you will enjoy Jerome's style as well. Tom Bethany is just the guy I'd like to be--if I were a guy. :-) Read his earlier works- grow with his characters."
1,Yuppie View of WWII Americans,"Unfortunately, this book is just a series of repetitive ""snippets"" that really does little to tell the story of this generation. I am about Brokaw's age and my parents and their brothers and sisters numbered 17 in total. I have heard all the stories, and have three uncles buried in Europe. I found Brocaw with little talent (this book could have been done by a mediocre college sophomore) and a love for ""Brocaw"". Never have I seen a ""talking head"" lever his TV exposure to the extent this guy has. He, like a lot of his generation gave little, reaped plenty and are looking for legitimacy via the accomplishments of their parents.Also, please note he put his name on every other page. Really a tacky work. The ""ME"" generation is true to form !!!!"
2,Just what it should be,"I bought this to be a candle warmer, not a mug warmer, but they are all the same. I like this one because it is black, so it isn't as noticeable on the dresser where it sits. The white one I had previously worked great, but it was so ugly on the dark wood. I am very pleased with the way it works."
1,Worst of the Series,"If you enjoyed the ending of Foundation's Edge then you will probably like this book. You will find more analogies comparing Gaia to things in the isolate world, and Bliss squaring off with Trevize about stuff you really don't care about. Asimov does, however, succeed in making you feel the fustration that the characters feel when they don't discover ANYTHING about Earth for the first 450 pages. The most annoying character is Fallom. I found myself wanting Trevize to kill Fallom as he suggests he will do several times in the book. The ""twist"" revealed in the last sentence is all but a surprise as Trevize foreshadows it several times in the book. I just read a review that this was more part of the Robot series than the Foundation series. I had only read the first four Foundation novels so perhaps that is why I didn't care for the portion of the book where they meander through space accomplishing nothing."
2,Love this collection,"If you enjoy all things English, not to mention Colin Firth, you will love this DVD. Not to mention the other great stories, not headlined by Mr. Firth."
1,Measure Of Bad Music,"Is the music business this desperate to go and sign this poor excuse for a musician to a record contract?A bad CD. Hey Clay, do us all a favor and retire right now, so our ears don't have to be polluted with this garbage any longer."
2,Charming surprise...,"This is such a feel-good film. Diane lane does a wonderful job playing the woman who leaves behind everything and starts over new. The people she meets, the scenery, the neuroses are all charming in their own way. Where Eat, Pray, Love failed, this film succeeded. A woman sets out to find herself after a personal disappointment, but rather than the whiny arrogant character of Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love, Diane Lane's character has a relatable warmth and energy despite her situation. i highly recommend this film for a rainy day."
2,What rock is all about,"This is possibly my favorite post 2000 band. I mean it is the best metal gets. Its political, hard and down right cool. John Dolmayan one of the coolest drummers makes me proud to be a drummer. Some of the songs were just funny little songs and some of them were angry rock and some of them were just memorable. but i still wish there was osme way to put it all together"
1,A New Definition,"I think I'm beginning to understand how popular fiction writing becomes ""Literature."" It apparently has to be depressing. If this is ""the best novel of Michener's career,"" as the Milwaukee Journal states it, then I don't need to depress myself further by reading the rest.I just don't believe it was necessary to kill off his major characters to make this a believable story."
1,Saperstein is a no talent,He has the eye and ear of an advertiser. Quick with the headline but totally lacking in content.A suit devoid of body and soul .
2,Clay Aiken does it again!,"This is the greatest album since ""Dizzy Up A Girl"" by Goo Goo Dolls. Clay is so natural at singing, it's like he sings like we breathe! Also, people who leave bad reviews, weren't really Clay fans to begining with, because anything Clay sings is wonderful!"
2,An H2 guide,"Good for you if you are preparing business plan, but lack of marketing idea. Just follow the ideas in this book."
2,great early nick cave,boys next door is a very early incantation of nick cave.pulsating group of song from a master and Shivers is one of the finest songs cave has ever written
2,Excellent!,"C.S. Lewis was a wonderful writer, to say the least. I was quite excited when I got this book in the mail and saw it was in basically excellent shape."
1,Not satisfied.,"I recently bought this shoe rack for my husband but after hanging the shoes, the rack started to wobble. It is not standing as it should, I have to rest it against the wall"
2,Investigating basics,"This book is a good start for someone who is interested in the paranormal and would like to try some of the techniques that investigators use to capture evidence of unexplained activity. There is helpful information on forming an investigative group and lists equipment that someone might wish to purchase. Richard Southall does a good job of describing how to use each piece of equipment to gather evidence. He does also express his theories on the paranormal, and it is interesting to listen to his point of view. I think this is a good start, but seasoned investigators are not likely to learn anything new."
2,great toy,the toy is pretty awsome. it is a lot of fun and really cool. the only problem is that the batteries die really fast.
1,Pocket Neopets,"I got this toy during the summer of '03 so I could have something to do on a long roadtrip I was going on. I love neopets, and I thought that a pocket neopet, would be similar to the site. Well it's not. It really boring. There is only four games that you can play. Negg Drop, Techno Says, Poogle Races and Fruit Machine. After about 20 minutes I got bored with the games. You can only earn Neopoints(neopets money) for the first couple of times you play. So I decided that I would buy some food and a toy for my neopet. Well there is only like 3 toys you can buy and 3 items of food you can buy. It's pretty boring. There is nothing else that you can really do. I put it in my junk drawer and havent taken it out sense. This is definatly not worth your money!"
1,Too many bible quotes & talk of SIN,"This is by far the worst book I have ever read on this topic. People with sexual addictions are not going to be helped by such bible-thumping judgments. So much talk of sin will only lead to more shame, not less. As Schaumburg recognizes that shame is such a large part of sexual addiction, you would think he would have avoided such heavy-handednessBesides, one has to assume that anyone bothering to read such a book already knows he/she has a problem. If they don't know, this will probably not convince them - it will only make them tune Shaumburg out as a throw-back to the '50s. It really is too bad, because the section concerning how to prevent sexual addiction in their child is very good."
1,Disappointing,"I thought this would be full of wit and wisdom along with salicous bits of gossip. Nope. An old man (venerable as he was) trying to remember. However, If I could read in the 18th century, this probably would be a best seller."
1,just ok,"Clay is ok but he's no Fantasia or Ruben, and never will compare with them, sure his fan's say he's the true AI, but all I ask is where is his million dollar contract that they give to the winner's, sure we all know about clays padded sell's,(what else is new) but where is his industry nom, did they forget about him, it look's that way, maybe one day his writers will write him some desent songs, that people other than his over zealious fan's can say there ok, but that's about all you can say about clay aiken's music is it's just ok, anything else would be a lie."
1,Very Disappointing!!,I bought this for my brother who is an architect. I thought the picture was really cute. I was really disappointed with this when I got it. It's made of hard plastic and there is a weight inside that bangs around when you move it. Completely not what I expected.
1,Disappointing,"I was hoping to get a step-by-step DVD on how to create a square foot garden. This was not that DVD. This DVD was really disappointing. I really need the help in getting my garden going, but this DVD didn't help.- No information on how to create your raised beds (which type of wood to use and why? How high should they be and why?)- No information on how to create Mel's mix (I'm not sure what she used for her soil, she never said)- No information on where to put the raised beds in your yard (Should you look for a shaded area? Lots of sun? Which plants for what type of shade)- No information on when and how often to water- Very little information on when to harvest- Very little information on how to take care of your plants in case of insects or diseases.This DVD was mainly about the plants the author chose to plant, spending about 15 minutes on the various varieties of tomato plants.The only good part of this DVD was the interview with Mel."
1,"Far too fundamentalist, with not enough Sun Tzu","I chose this book out of sheer desperation when I was looking for a good investment book on Holidays.This book is so far slanted toward a fundamentalist approach that I believe the author thinks Graham and Buffett are gods. It reads very poorly and the author could have imparted his message in less than a few pages.The author also denigrades all technical analysis with a few choice statistics that do not hold water very well.In my view this is a big let down, and I wish I could get my time and money back."
1,It's a knock off.,"The official Chrono Trigger OST has 3 discs. This version has some of the major tracks on it, the audio quality is good, but Caveat Emptor (buyer beware) this is a Chinese knock-off.Oh and if you buy the 3 disc version, make sure the cover does not have a green and red logo reading ""FX"", for this is also a counterfeit. The serial numbers on the real soundtrack CDs are PSCN-5021, PSCN-5022, and PSCN-5023."
1,Disappointed,"I love the 1632 series. I have bought every book as soon as the come out, and enjoyed each immensely. This is not a novel in the normal definition. It is a collection of stories, kind of like the Gazette, except the Gazette is interesting. I was bored frankly with the stories. I normally read a book in less than a day, but this one took me over 4 days, because i just could not get interested, I just finished it to keep me in the story and to ensure I would not miss anything for future books."
2,Very nice,"Yes, the arrangements are almost identical to the studio release. But in many cases the performances are superior. Vocals come through clearer; ideas are more obvious. It's a real testament to their musicianship/professionalism that the songs are so similar in demo and final form. Clearly, they are their own producers, rather than pretty faced fools who let others turn their songs into hits. Have some heart, pundits. They need the money. I read a long (and entertaining) interview where they described how much it cost to rent the orchestra for one day. It wiped out almost all the money they had. Yes, their own money. So if you wanna hear the second Apple Venus, quit yer yappin. This demo CD is for supporters and fans of musicians, rather than record companies."
2,great graphics for the money,"great for gaming. With dual head monitor support + DVI & TV out, the 64 MB memory on this Card and the extremely affordable pricepoint make it one of the best options available today. If you are a hard-core CG effects person, this won't be the best option, but otherwise, it is the way to go."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this,"First the good things. It cuts through ceramic tile easily and I actually had good success using the 45 degree cutting feature, although, it's a little sloppy.Now for the bad. I had problems similar to previous readers:The fence had to be modified to fit, it is very difficult to adjust, it is not accurate (you will need to use a tape measure), and the fence stripped out after about 10 cuts so it could no longer clamp to the table.This made it effectively USELESS for accurate cutting, so my day of tiling was wasted. Oh, and tiles catch on rear blade gaurd.I am now going to try and return the saw."
1,Waste of time for me,I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. It didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. Waste of money for me.
1,Hostile nonsense,"Written in the late Thirties, this book is a misguided attempt to interpret Robespierre as a precursor to Hitler and Stalin. It is a complete distortion of the aims and goals of the French revolution. Interested readers should pursue histories by Thompson, Hampson, Jordan and Rude instead to get a more accurate portrait of Robespierre"
2,StarGate Fan,"Stargate: Continuum is a good watch for anyone who has been a fan of the series. I've bought both this one and Stargate - The Ark of Truth, and enjoyed both. I think The Ark of Truth may have been a little better, but that is a personal judgement."
2,Best Book I've Read Since The Joy Luck Club,"I have just finished reading this book at age 44. My mother suggested it over 20 years ago and I started it and never finished it. I read this book and cried, and laughed, and cried, and just passed it on to my 15-year-old daughter to read. It is a true classic. Reading this book was like eating a fabulously rich dessert and then feeling sad when it is all gone."
1,Rickety and cheap,"I thought this thing was great when I first bought it... then I used it for a few months. The stem now always lilts to one side, so that it leans against the wall of my closet, or toward the door. It also doesn't turn easily after a while. This is just one of those crap pieces that works out of the box, but wasn't built to last. Buyers beware!"
2,"You can't simply read the book, you have to use this workbook.","I read the book and loved it. When I bought the work book, my first thought was that this was just some kind of book '0 forms. Much like what you would find in a stationary store or at an office supply store. But I was wrong. This book is really two books. The work book is designed to be cut into two different books. One is a record book that enables you to track your entire job hunting campaign. The other book, and in my opinion, the most important, enables you to create an absolutely magnificant resume. If you loved the book, then this work book is an absolute must.However, I must caution you that the workbook is, indeed, a lot of work. And so to really use the book, you must use the workbook. And to use the workbook, you need to exert effort. The rewards are great. This is a dynimite combination. He is really something else. I recommend this book very highly."
2,LOVE IT..LOVE IT,"Mr. Aiken's AMAZING VOICE and the beautifully written SONGS make this a MUST HAVE CD for everyone...There is a little bit of everything on this CD from upbeat love songs to moving ballads...Clay's voice really shines on ""I WILL CARRY YOU"", ""INVISIBLE"" and ""TOUCH"" have great upbeat tempos, ""RUN TO ME"" and ""NO MORE SAD SONG"" prove CLAY can really rock, and you just can't help but sing along to ""WHEN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME"" which is my FAVORITE song on the CD... I recommend you BUY THIS CD TODAY!!"
1,Pretentious,"Found it stupid and annoying. This pretends to be a documentary made 5 million years into the future sent back to the present day, supported by bad computer graphic fantasy animals. In a word, pretentious."
1,Worst diapers ever,"These diapers are terrible. They leak in the front, through the diaper! How does that even happen? My 6 month old needed a new one every two hours, otherwise it would leak and soak his clothes. Putting him in one for bedtime was a joke. 12 hours? No way. We had to buy a case of Swaddlers for nighttime so he wouldn't soak his PJ's at night. Don't waste your money- get the Swaddlers, they're fantastic!"
2,Favorably impressed!,"This little heater works far better than I'd hoped. I tested it in my toughest space, the 10 x 40 glassed front porch. For three nights, the outside temp was right at 27. The radiator on its highest setting kept the porch temp at 60! In other, smaller, rooms getting a cozy heat is no big deal. The only noise it makes is an occasional (low) click. I'd have given it five stars if the dial were easier to read, and it had a handle on both sides instead of one."
1,Avoid at All Costs,"Could Water Bearer Films have found a print in worse condition? With weaker, more faded color? There is a note on the back cover that the ""Digital color enhancement"" has been copyrighted - that's enhancement? And on top of it all it looks like a poor copy of a VHS tape. The wretched quality of the picture... and the sound as well... make the DVD virtually unwatchable. A 1968 film shouldn't look as bad as this. I guess we're just supposed to be grateful that the film is available on DVD - thanks, but no thanks, Water Bearer."
2,A Contemporary Fairytale Sure to Delight!,"While this book is a take-off on the classic Snow White, it's a fairytale for grown ups with some class act characters and a rich and rewarding love story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and look forward to more of Ms. Sinclair's works."
1,A very poorly done horror movie.,"A group of people who has sleeping problem are the subject of an experiment by a scientist (Liam Neeson). The experimen takes place in a haunted house. Doesn't make any sense to me. The story is bad, the screenplay is bad even all the performers here are bad. This is by far the worst movie by Jan de Bont. Frankly after the first ""Speed"", all his movies are going down hill and this one hits rock bottom. I am giving it 2 stars for outstanding audio and video quality of the DVD."
2,One of the most exciting and readable books about spelunking,"Herb and Jan Conn were amateur climbers in the 1930s who fell in love with the Black Hills of South Dakota. At a friend's suggestion, the Conns began moonlighting as spelunkers in winter. When they first visited Jewel Cave, it was a tiny cavern with an intriguing unexplored passage. Luckily for the Conns, that passage led to a mile of unexplored cave passages, then two miles... and exploring Jewel Cave became the Conns' life's work. They describe the exciting exploration (which is still ongoing, with more than 100 miles of passages mapped) with just the right balance of action/adventure, science, and humor. This book is a pioneer of the outdoor/geography genre and is readable, fun and fascinating.-Review by David Bezanson"
2,Excellent Text for the Intro. Level,"The text is excellent and is suitable for any type of introductary Ecnonomics class. It can be used in a tough course or an easy course, as it provides a great level of organization so that the instructor may choose the material at his discretion depending on his course lay out."
2,"reads well, despite an unsympathetic lead","Hardy mixes the comical here with the sorrowful so you're at once, entertained and saddened by the events; the largest event which brings on the sale of one man's wife and child to another; a moment which both liberates and destroys the main character through-out the story. Competition and jealousy figure prominently in the time line, which covers many years in the lives of a few sad people. You could say Michael Henchard was doomed from the 1st chapter. He certainly is haunted by his past to the point of no escape. And in fact, it's his past (as well as everyone who was part of it) that fuels the inevitable heartbreak to come. Casterbridge as a central location isn't quite as powerfully stark as Edgon Heath from... Native but the landscape does affect the players in similar ways. A wicked sense of folly usually dominates every novel Hardy has written."
2,Very nice glider,"Good quality and fairly easy to assemble, although it helps to have 2 people. It is quite comfortable and looks nice."
1,Costs $10.89 at Target online,Costs much less at Target but I won't buy it because of bad reviews on Amazon. Will buy a bigger canister when I find the right one.
2,On with the foundation,"Unlike the first Foundation book, which was a series of related but not inter-connected stories, Foundation and Empire has two longer stories. This lets Asimov flesh out the stories more, adding detail and plot intricacies. The first story, The Big and The Little, is not one of the series' strongest. However, the second story, The Mule, is the masterpiece of the series. It tells of a muntant, The Mule, who falls outside the scope of Hari Seldon's psychohistory as one supremely powerful individual. The story is told in almost detective story fashion similar to the first two Robot novels. It's quite as suspenseful and involving as Asimov at his best and one of his utmost classics. There's quite a lot of plot tangling and twists, and the ending is a shocker. It's not quite a cliffhanger but will definitely make you want to read the next book, which is great also. The whole series comes highly recommended."
1,Great idea but mine's broken,"Loved this from the moment I put it on the bike. Took a little work, just a little, but switched it to my wife's bike and then back to mine. Some where in there we loaded it down too much and one of the slide in plastic brace ears broke and now it is unusable. Searching for a new way to haul groceries now..."
2,Read this book and get hooked on the entire series!,"A 5-year old Cro-Magnon girl in prehistoric Europe is tragically orphaned by an earthquake that kills her family. She is left to wander aimlessly through an ice age harsh barren landscape without clothing or resources. She suffers terribly from starvation, exhaustion, and wounds sustained from a cave lion attack before being adopted by a Neanderthal clan when she was near death. The heroine Ayla is a survivor. She is strong and resourceful. She polishes her survival skills at a very young age and develops many positive characteristics. I was enthralled with her character and the hardships she had to endure. She is an inspirational figure and I thought about her often when writing 'Adoption Detective'. The long wait between sequels was agonizing. Read this book and you will be hooked on the entire Jean M. Auel series.Judith Land, AuthorAdoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child"
2,Does the Job,I just plugged it in and it's on the job. Perhaps it would be more assuring if it had a digital read-out of level of monooxide in the air.
1,The Other Side Of A Christian Classic,"Forgive me for rating a respected book so poorly. If your quest is to discover why certain disciplines are needed, then ignore what I have to say. This book delivers. If, on the otherhand, you are going to buy this book with the expectation that it will move beyond expressing the need, you will be disapointed. If you are looking for help in developing these disciplines in your life, you will not find it here. This book is not about ""how"", only ""why"". Which question are you asking?"
1,broken,I was not even able to use this item because it tore upon putting it together. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!
1,offensive to Christians,"Each to his own taste, but I wish I'd read some of the negative reviews here before I wasted time and money on this book. The only ""secret"" revealed in this book is the author's personal, overt political pro abortion and gay marriage agenda. Seriously, if you are a Christian, do yourself a favor and just skip this ridiculous attempt to make fun of your Christian beliefs."
1,ILLUSTRATED--NOT?,I downloaded the free sample--there were NO illustrations! The text was not long & boring as other reviewers have said; Is the sample a bad representation?
1,The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh,"I'm not exactly going out on a limb to say this is going to be the same transfer used almost five years ago by NoShame films. The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh is a pretty good giallo, I'd give the film itself 3 stars. If you didn't buy the out of print NoShame disc this may be a good option.It will be interesting to see if this is indeed the same transfer from NoShame and if it will include the great extras from that disc. Also, if it isn't a new transfer and doesn't have the extras, it will be funny that the NoShame disc from five years ago was list priced at $19.95 while this is listed as $24.95!Time will tell but beware of this shady company, who charges more and gives you less."
1,VR,"Well first of all I dont think anybody should judge Roger, If they did their research they would know what happened, Once Dead was ok a few good tunes but overall it all sounds the same. For the Human Sacrficie Album Mulligan's Stew is probobly my Favorite VR Tune."
2,The BEST SCI-FI / Adventure book I have ever read. Great!,"Simply put, this book is what other writer strive to achieve. It has a little of everything: Fantasy, Adventure, Exploration, Mythology, Romance, and Scientific Theory of the day. Fascinating exploration of what is really in the unused 90% of the mind."
1,American Tourister Travel Iron,"Very cheaply/poorly made. Within two uses, water reservoir cap was broken. Could no longer use the steam as water leaked out. Would not recommend."
2,Great kids story,"This story is a great one involving magic, different worlds, knights and all the things that make fairy tales great. Any child who likes to read and has an active imagination will like this story. Geared a little more for boys, but I think most girls would appreciate it just as much. This was a favorite at our house growing up and is already on my son's bookshelf, though he is a little too young for it just yet."
1,slow,interesting and well worth a read but difficult with the old English at times and tends to be long winded and rambles somewhat
1,Never even shipped,i ordered this package for my psycology 121 class and it was to be bundled with several other books. the Item never even shipped and the other books came seperately because this item was so slow. i canceled the order and bought the book elsewhere. i do not recommend this seller.
2,Clay is so awesome!,"I thought Clay's single was good, but this is the best cd ever! Ofcourse I am and always have been a huge Clay fan, ever since i first saw him, but this cd blew me away! I love Clay Aiken!"
1,hummm,"A little too flowery for my taste and not very scientific. Then again what did I expect !!! Easy pros however if you want to learn about anatomy, get an anatomy atlas !!"
1,Not good as Pampers Swaddlers,"By the time when I wanted the size 3 diapers for my baby, Pampers swaddlers were not available and I had to buy these after reading the reviews . The problem with these are they don't have the wet indicator and the baby dry don't absorb the runny poop and it tends to just go right up the back side of the diaper onto her outfit and usually whatever or whoever she is lying on.It's just not worth the money saved! I will only buy the Swaddlers from now on. Hope this helps someone wondering which to buy Swaddlers or Baby Dry, DEFINITELY go with the SWADDLERS!!This is almost the one of the existing reviews."
1,Mr Coffee Mug Warmer,"I have several ""Mr Coffee"" branded products which is why I chose this one. Have to say I am disappointed. My coffee gets luke warm then cold using this product which is disappointing. I would not recommend this product to others."
1,Good if you listen to ONE radio station at all times!,"I live in Phoenix, AZ and we have quite a few radio stations that are listed with E-marker. The main problem is that you have to wait 24 hours before the radio and song information is updated on E-marker's web page. Also, if you listen to more than one station it becomes a problem to remember what station you were listening to at the time you heard the song and pressed the E-marker. Trust me, it is hard to remember which one of your 3 listed radio stations you were listening to, especially if it was more than 24 hours ago - I thought the whole point behind this product was to let you not remember!"
2,Fabulous!!,I think this album is brilliant--awesome music!! Can't turn it off!!! Especially love Allegratango!!! Adiemus could sing to the sound of a washing machine and still sound good! Kudos!!!
2,Review,"It arrived in a timely manner.I haven't gotten to read it yet, but I'm super excited about it.I've been reading through Isaiah and I wanted something to go along with it."
1,Only use if original pins are broken.,I ordered these to replace my worn pins on my truck. I'm CDO about my truck and I noticed a bit of play in the factory stock hinge on the driver door. As it turns out these are made with pretty generous clearances and my door now has more play than it did before installing these. My next step is to try McMaster-Car in hope they will have a tighter fitting bushing in the correct size for my door hinge.I gave them two stars because they do an adequate job of holding the door onto the truck.FYI: CDO is similar to OCD except the letters are in the correct order.Erik
2,"eye opener- these problems aren't just past, their present.","This book was suprising, I sat down in a classroom expecting to read some boring book with no meaning. But this book has meaning, more than meaning, it has amazing connections. 12-year-old Patty Bergan, a Jewish girl, helps an escaped Nazi, Anton. But this man isen't the stereotypical Nazi, he's her friend. her abusive father and perfect mother look at Patty as a mistake, leaving her only friends to be Anton and her Nanny. So many problems are struggled with that unfortunatly come up today. It's sad how a small little stereotype, with one wrong person, can tear friendships apart. Leaving a torn picture for others to glue. Read the book, and you'll know what I mean."
2,I disagree with just about all of these reviews...,"These are the same games you remember from the eighties....of course they seem basic by today's standards, but if you loved them like I did you will be very happy with this game. No duh pac man and ms. pacman are the same game....we knew that in 1983. The point is, you will likely buy this game out of nostalgia, not because you are looking for the next huge special effects dynamo p.c. game. If you loved these games 20 years ago, you'll enjoy the heck out of this game because they are the exact same games simply made playable on the Xbox."
1,They lost me at Bollywood,I was enjoying this series until the HORRIBLE Bollywood episode when the solution to the issue of a huge Abnormal who could move sections of the earth was a Bollywood-style dance. That ended it for me.
1,I just dont understand,"Maybe it is just me but this is some real crap. Dont get me wrong, I like black metal, and not just the symphonic stuff like Dimmu Borgir and later Emporer. This album i akin to someone pissing in my ear. There is almost no quality in the musicianship. Repetitive and just plain boring. If you want to hear REAL old-school but also excellent BM go and get Satyricon's The ShadowThrone and anything by Mayhem. Dont waste your time with this drivel. im not a kid either but beleive what you will."
2,Ageless classic,"I had seen the movie based on this book years ago. The book has as much meaning in this day and age as it did when it was written.I was captivated by how stark, dirty, dingy, and hopeless the main charcter's view of the world is, even when trying to rebell.I think it's a very insightful look into just where a society can go. Even one with the best of intentions. It's very applicable in this era."
1,Confused,"I was very much disappointed with this album.I really didn't need to hear of all their problems in life.I did not purchase this album to hear them talk about themselves, I wanted to hear their music, which on this album there is very little. I am sending this album back to Amazon. Stay away if you are looking for music."
1,Great in theory....horrible in execution,"They had a great idea with this film (despite clearly borrowing the concept from ""Hostel"")...a group of stranded tourists in Brazil are drugged and robbed and left with no alternative but to follow a ""friend"" into the jungle, ostensibly to have their organs sold on the black market, unbeknownst to them.What failed was just about everything from the horrible acting, to the gratuitous bikini-clad ""Hostel"" wanna-bees, to the implausibility of their situation and the fact that a horror film should actually be scary. Unfortunately, what could have been an interesting and scary film was just plain dumb!I would NOT recommend renting this movie (or even watching it for free once it comes to Cable), let alone paying money for it. If you like the idea behind the film, ""Hostel"" is a much better take on the could-it-really-happen-to-me-as-a-traveler-in-a-foreign-country horror film."
2,"Great origin story, in classic Nolan fashion","The movie is great, but the service (and prices) amazon provides for this film is great. I'm very happy to have bought the rights to this digital product rather than buying a dvd from some brick and mortar retailer! Great movie, great convenience!"
2,Right on the Money,"Perfect for the hot dog bar at my son's Mickey Mouse Carnival themed birthday party. The dogs were thoroughly cooked, and the machine itself was precious. Break down of the item allowed for easy cleaning and storing after the event. The machine is covered by a thin plastic (not fantastic quality), but it was sturdy enough to get the job done and to be expected for the price."
2,intersting,This book has opend up my eyes. Robert Frost is in my mind one of the best potes in the world.
1,Biography of a Grissly by Seton,"I didn't realize that there was no illustrations in the book and Seton was a very fine illustrator, so why would you publish one of his books without the illustrations?"
1,Booooooring,"Alright, this movie is boring. I watched it hoping that it would get better and it didn't. I had a lot of high hopes for this movie based on the reviews I read before watching it. Yes, Nick Cage did a good job with what he had and Eva as always is beautiful but that is pretty much the highlight of the movie."
1,Completely UNREVISED AND OUTDATED!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have found shop set up for effecient layout and dust collection to be the most important aspects of my woodworking. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to be as effecient and effective in these areas. I could find no difference in this book and the earlier version it replaces. Even the photos are same outdated photos that appear to be taken in the late 70's used in the 2001 release. Please, Taunton, don't insult your readers by continuing to regurgitate the same information with a shiny new label in an attempt to sell more books. Please strive to produce new and relevant photos and information. Your books and magazines are already some of the most expensive, it would be nice if the quality matched."
2,getting into the spirit,a fascinating and stimulating account that seems to put things into the proper perspective. Makes the myths all the more enjoyable.
2,GREAT!!! A MUST HAVE,"GREAT STORY... LOVE IT, WHAT A GREAT MAN HE WAS!!! THIS IS A NICE MOVIE OF ONE OF OUR SAINTS!!!!"
1,Worst yet!,"Amazingly silly dance routines. Baaaad acting. Lame, lame, lame story (I particularly love how the meteorite happens to land right next Peter and Mary Jane while making-out on a giant self-made web). And all for a mere $60 retail. Thank god for Amazon! If you're into this sort of thing that is. Don't let the effects dazzel your brain, this is truely one of the worst comic book movies, yet. And it's Spiderman, how can you screw that up."
1,"Even with the strong and complex performance of Rachel Weisz, Keanu still finds a way to suck the life out of the movie","Moronic and self indulgent Keanu Reeves vanity project lacks the heart and the wits of the comic book which it steals most of it's ideas form and ruins them with a horrible acting performance by Keanu Reeves, which looks more like he's reading from cue cards than remembering a script. The rest of the actors do better in their roles than he does with Rachel Weisz stealing the show with a deep and strong performance, Gavin Rossdale, doing a very convincing job as an agent of the underworld and Djmon Hounsou giving a bit role more class than he should have. Tilda Swinton does well with a small role that is very underwritten and Shia LaBeouf is well, Shia LaBeouf. Don't expect any more than that.Skip it, you will thank yourself later."
1,Disappointing,"The text is the same as ever (I think), but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have purchased this volume."
1,Marginal,"This collection of sentences and catch phrases is VERY weak on technical details and VERY heavy on the diatribe. In several instances, it is down right incorrect when referencing history. This book may fit the needs of a poli. sci. type, but it is less than a dust collector when it comes to those working in the fields of IT/IW/IA. As a 2 decade professional in the field, take my recommendation and avoid this book if you are looking for anything beyond recycled political phrases related to IW."
2,For Me The Gold Standard,Don't know if it's from me listening to my Dad's albums every Christmas or not? For me this is the Christmas album by which all others are judged.
2,best album I've heard in a while,"On my first listen to 'Catch Without Arms,' I was a little disappointed. I had been hoping for something that was closer in style to Leitmotif, but that's not what they delivered. But after listening to it a few times, I've gotten over the fact that their style has diverged a bit from their original sound. And, now I think that I do like 'Catch Without Arms' even more than their previous efforts."
2,10 stars,"This is one of the best video concerts ever. The sound, visuals and performances are top notch. It is a real joy. I have owned it a week and watched it 3 times already. Every performance is good. There are no dead spots during this concert and you get quite a number of them. A keeper. Memorable."
2,This blue-ray is wonderful...,Porcupine Tree is amazing! Essential for anyone who likes rock and roll.Anesthetize (DVD + Blu-ray)
1,This is fallacious,wow this book is very misleading if your a layperson do your research. You will see this textbook everywhere but if you go to were the evidence is this argument completely falls apart are founding fathers printed the first English bible lol but yet these guys say there atheist and agnostic this is funny this book is not documenting a single thing.
1,Book ends at climax=horrible!:<,"I am writing this review based on the words of my 4th grade son. He was really excited to get this book as he thought that it was going to be a great story. His grandparents live in TX and he thought that it would be a lot of fun to read a book that takes place where they live.He breezed through the book and then was SOOOO disappointed at the ending. He said that just as the book was getting more exciting, it just ended. He was really wishing that the author could have solved the mystery of the boy ghost.Hope that our next book is a better one. He said that he would NOT recommend this book to a friend."
2,Clay Aiken,"When you're truly looking forward to a CD being released, you can build your hopes up so high that you feel let down when you finally hear it. My expectations for this album were not met - they were exceeded!! Every time I think my love and respect for Clay can't possibly grow any further, that's exactly what happens. The one thing that probably stands out most about this CD is its ability to make you totally unable to choose a favorite song... they are all so INCREDIBLE! In true Clay style, he goes above and beyond ""the bar,"" putting all of his efforts into a creation that does his fans oh, so proud."
1,Am I the only one?,"Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? Why this was so critically accliamed is beyond me. It was all...bleh. The action, the characters, the acting, the dialouge......it was all bleh. Sure, it may be the best Batman movie, but that's not saying much at all. The talk was that this was going to be a dark and realistic movie. I just saw it as another silly superhero fare. I guess I just don't like superheroes. If you want an interesting and dark action flick, check out the Bourne series. Batman is just for little kids and comic book fans."
1,lemon!,"just got this charger yesterday to replace my broken apple charger.All this charger does is allow me to turn on the computer (sometimes), it does NOT charger my powerbook g4."
2,Handy help,"These picks are effective, very handy and come in a compact container from which they are easily removed, but won't spill."
2,See the film .... but ALSO: read the book !,"Definitely one of the few books that give you the feeling that life is just worth living. Once you realize what is 'ultimate catastrophe' or 'the one unforgivable sin', you will see life differently. If you have seen the film and listened to the music, go forward and read the book"
2,Rememberances,"I knew Richard Bradford when he was just out of Tulane University and I was married to one of his best friends. He claims this book not to be autobiographical but there are some similarities and I cannot help but believe that some of the adventures of he and Steenie are based on his friendship with my husband. The book is a masterpiece and I have read it often since it was first published in 1968. His second book ""So Far from Heaven"" is just as clever and regrettably impossible to find. ""Red Sky at Morning"" remains a classic."
1,Didn't receive the product I was viewing,"There are two photos here. One, with the authentic head band and the other, comparing the bootleg version with the authentic one. Here's the problem... I was hoping to receive the authentic one but turned out to get the bootlegged one. I'm not very happy with it but I'm not planning to use it for cosplay or something of that nature. Still would've been better to get the better looking one."
2,A Most Enjoyable Book,"A very enjoyable book written by a great writer and a great American. Mr. Franklin tells about his early years and what is enjoyable is to hear the way some of the great ideas he had were then carried out. Every thing from the postal department, partnerships, even down to street cleaning.The price is right and very interesting not only for historians."
2,MIGHTY ENDING,"I have to say this: I enjoyed this book from top to bottom. Terry is there all right, with its excelent writing and a very, very odd way of looking at things. Of course, you laugh your eyes out in almost every page, specially with the screams of the shelled God Om and the comentaries of Dydactilus and Urn. And the book has one of the best endings I have read in a very long time. Lets just said:I. Is Godly.II. Respect tortoises over yourself.P.S. If I had the incredible memory of Brutha, surely I would be a prophet, without the requisite of crossing the desert, although maybe not having that much fun."
2,No leaks for a big boy,"I've had a lot of trouble finding a paper diaper that fits my 29 1/2"" long, 23lb 7 month old boy, he's a wiggler, jumper, tosser, turner, and roller, but these seem to fit really well. We've had no poo up the back (even when he poo'd while jumping in his bouncer) and no leaks overnight, both of which were problems before. I haven't had any rashes from chemicals, dyes, or perfumes which was also a problem with other brands in the past."
1,The fastening tab is sharp like razor blades that often bruise or cut baby thighs,"I like Pampers Dry for almost everything, except the fastening tab. I had tried every way: change diaper every 2 hours or so, make sure the tabs go far up on the diaper. However, as my baby is very active, crawling and learning to walk, very often he gets cuts or red bruises on his thighs, sometimes on the tummy, where the fastening tabs touch the skin.Please Pampers do something about the sharpness of the tabs."
2,alfie einstein :),"Alfie is another british band with an unexplainable amount of talent. Unexplainable because it seems most british groups are ingenious in their own way. Where did they get it from? Who knows? But i do know that us rebels over here in the beautiful u.s., took only a bit of that musical ingenuity when crossing the big pond back in the day. Okay, all gawking aside, i must admit that alfie's lead singer reminds me slightly of the lead singer of ""they might be giants"". That's a good thing if you like (or can tolerate) ""they might be giants"". Luckily i grew up listening to my sisters collection of music, and t.m.b.g. happened to be in the mix. So alfie, like you might expect, is ingenious (on tracks 2 & 3 inparticular) and a bit quirky (especially the vocals(all tracks)). But don't buy this album because you want good, strange music, buy it because it's good, mellow music with great instrumentation and a unique sound."
1,Houston...we have a problem,"I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world."
2,SOAD is high on my list,"I was lucky enough to go to Ozzfest for free by wining tickets, and they were the best band there, period. Their second CD is deffinintaly one of my best, and shows they can go from speed metal 1-2 trashes to calm melodic beats, and back. Any fan of Heavy Metal/Rock should and would like this album. BUY IT, IT ROCKS!!"
1,Not exactly what i expected,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine, although i wanted to watch it as well. From the description of the movie i thought it would be entertaining and funny. Well the movie was pretty cheesy to say the least. The special effects were not good at all, the plot was thin (what can you expect from a gay vampire movie?). There was one hot scene in the movie. Other than that it was just not something i would want to watch again. Have a bunch of friends over for drinks and watch it, that would be entertaining!"
1,Boring and pointless,"I found it difficult to read through, goes into heavy detail on 17th Century German farming culture early on and that was the exciting part."
1,Baby dry diapers are NOT for us.,"I decided to try the cheaper Pampers Baby Dry instead of my usual Pampers Cruisers. I figured there couldn't be much of a difference, but boy there sure was! I HATE the Baby Dry diapers! Every time my son urinates there is such a strong pee smell that I assume he has peed right through the diaper. However, I check him, and it's not through the diaper - it just smells like it! I can't stand that! I've never had a diaper perform like this one does. I WON'T be ordering this kind again, that's for sure!"
2,Amazing,i have ordered this cd of here but it will take abit to get to me as i live in England. But i have danced and sang along to it at the arcades ive been to and i think its great if you love to dance. My favorite songs are what a feeling and in the navey!! i also like captain jack but i love them all..
1,Watch out when purchasing DVD's shipped within the USA but not able to be viewed in the USA because wrong region!?,"I was very disappointed when my DVD arrived and I was unable to view it because I live in the wrong region. Much to my surprise DVD's are specific to certain regions and our DVD players will not allow them to play. I purchased it from Amazon and it said it was coming from North Carolina so why would I suspect that I would not be able to watch it. In fact, until this incident I was totally unaware of such a thing and I feel that consumers should be informed about this. So you are warned! I will however mention that the company Amazon arranged my purchase through refunded my money but my time was wasted."
1,Dry but not the best choice for size 1,Props:- The diaper actually does a good job on dry out.Cons:- It is too thin to hold watery poop- It does not have a wetness indicator.Definitely not a good choice for new parents. I will probably buy it when the baby older than 6 months because it's cheaper than others.
1,Career Advice Ray J:Avoid a Recording Studio,"aside from the Fact that I was only trying to get the Cut He did with R.kelly""Quit Actin"", I wasn't paying this cat no musical mind.Ray J is vocally tone challenged.he can't make up His Mind who is attempting to jack as a Singer.One Minute He wants some R.kelly,then Usher,Omarion,etc...Problem is dude ain't much of a Singer.so i was surprised to hear any Record Company was actually gonna give Him a solo deal.but anyway I got the song I wanted&tunned out the rest.maybe if He is lucky he can get a gig on the UPN network.wait a minute I heard he got something linned up well stick to it&stay out of the Music lab."
1,The Dark Side of Bill Blass,"Pros:I bought this shirt before it changed to $10 a pop.Has magical powers.I wore this shirt on Superbowl Sunday and the Steelers won.Cons:I put the shirt on and chaos erupted, i.e., it is flammable."
1,terrible,Don't bother watching this movie. The facts are all wrong. The acting is not all that god. JLH tries her best but falls flat on her face. If you want to learn about Audrey read on of the many books written on her or watch the A&E biography.
2,KI A Road Anyone Can walk,This is a very interesting book describing KI and how anyone can use it for various applications in life. Anyone would be happy with this book.
2,if interested in knowledge of the buddist religion; this is a must book,from start to finish it left you with knowledge and a possible desire to get in deeper. i read the entire book in only two sessions.
2,The Unbelieveable Genius of Philip Kaufman,"A glorious acheivment in the history of American Film. Passionately directed and gorgeously photographed, with impeccable acting from Day-Lewis, Binoche and Olin. ""Unbearable"" will linger in your head for weeks after watching it. And it's one of the few movies to use animal death in a non-cheap fashion: The death of Tomas and Tereza's dog is riveting and beautifully performed. Contrary to some opinions, the book is not better than the film; it's an entirely different entity structured in a seemingly unfilmable, non-linear fashion. As a written story, it doesn't make the kind of dramatic sense it does on screen. What Kaufman pulls off with ""Unbearable"" is truly remarkable."
2,Best Transformers movie ever.,"Easily the best film in the series. Tranformers: Dark of the Moom is the summer event film I have been waiting for. Perhaps the biggest surprise here is that the girl replacing Megan Fox is a much better actress. The action and set pieces, including an amazing chase scene on a freeway are incredible. The last hour set in a war-torn Chicago are some of the greatest sequences ever put to film. Shia does a terrific job being both witty and funny, but also very emotional when the time comes. Unlike the first two Transformer movies, this time it truly feels like something is at stake. While I loved the first two for what they were, this one has a more authentic story and tighter narrative. Finally a 3D movie with actually depth in the shots! Your jaw will definitely drop in certain scenes."
1,Halica Bliss Out v.11...,"...is the full and misleading name of this album, one that is as run of the mill as a fan of electronic metamusic could desire. This album has seven tracks, ranging in time from 3-11 minutes, but don't let that fool you into thinking there's much variety. All of them meld together after the first, ""Fish"", which is the highlight among few others that are moderately well-crafted and distinct. There is a definite feeling of sonic recycling (""didn't I just hear that whir on the previous track?"") and a limited sound spectrum within their grasp. One can't expect too terribly much from indie techno, so its unfair to condemn this album for lack of equipment. It's usually competent, even musical, but when an occasional vocal bit is all that differentiates one track from another, one tends to seek greener electropastures."
2,finlands power,one of finlands best kept secrets.this cd is full of power. tarja turunen vocals are just stunning.from the haunting song a dead boys poem to the powerfull she is my sin and crownless this cd is for any one who is into great euro metal a must.
2,Glad I finally found it!,"I remember watching this on TV and taped it them. Somewhere along the way I lost the tape and finally found it on here. It is a FANTASTIC show!!! A must have for anyone...no caveats, just anyone who likes music!"
1,Visually stunning but story adulterated,"The movie captures the look and feel of Narnia and many scenes are beautifully blocked and filmed. However, the movie's creators tampered too much with the actual story. This is a flaw not because they ""should"" or ""must"" copy the books exactly;we all recognize that some creativity may be required to retell a book's story as a smashingly good movie. This, they failed to do. The ridiculous attempt at a love story between Susan and the Prince was embarassing. And turning Miraz the usurper into the first acceptor of the new land was totally unnecessary and ineffective. News flash: There is a reason these stories have stood the test of time and been read and re-read by children and adults, generation after generation-- they are good stories! Don't mess with them unless it's absolutely necessary and is done effectively."
2,Excellent tempo,"I love doing this workout, and sometimes the breathing portion at the end is all I do, as it leaves me feeling great. I would rate if 5 stars if it had any headstand prep work."
2,A must for travel and for a clean-smelling nursery!,"This stuff is amazing! I apply it a bit more liberally than they recommend and I always use Sassy disposal bags for the dirty diapers, but this spray is a lifesaver...especially if you are out & about. It can save you much embarrassment. Our baby has a partial intestinal blockage, which makes her diapers smell like something caustic and this spray even masks that!! We keep a small bottle in the diaper bag and a large one at both changing tables."
1,High Mountain but a flat book,What an amazing accomplishment! I wish she could had written the book better! I admire mountaineers but this book was frustrating to read. She sounds so arrogant in this and just not a nice person. I can understand being on a team with some annoying or inexperienced people but that is the chance you take being part of a team. If she didn't want to listen to someone talk all the time or deal with someone that didn't have her experience she should have hired a private guide to take her up the mountain. She always mentioned her compliments and her achievements and how she triumphed eventhough she was a girl-and how the guys on the team would make comments- OH PLEASE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. If you want a really good book read Into thin Air or Seven Summits.
2,Gold Toe is the Gold Standard,Love these socks from Gold Toe. They last and they are well made. Most of my socks are Gold Toe.
1,Quite funny,"Deadly accurate too, especially the mother stuff. Incredible performances, but I'd rather curl up with the cat and watch 'Roman Holiday'. Life's too short to roll around in the John."
1,A shame to the Resident Evil name,So much for hoping Capcom would have learned it's lesson from the first Outbreak game. Nothing was improved in this chapter. This game still has the same stupid A.I. and annoying real time window that made the first game horrible. Not to mention the characters' audio and text often times don't correlate. Zombies popping up at random times just helped to compound frustration levels. Probably most disappointing is the lack of suspense and creepy atmosphere that made many Resident Evil predecessors so great.
2,"I wanted to say ""Damn!""","...but I had to expound on that on account of all these bad reviews.If this book is not for you to get then that's fine and it's sad, but don't be so angry--coherence isn't everything. It's the heart that makes Kerouac, the sailing, pounding, beautiful, soulful, angry, churning, palpable heart.And for those who worry that this is required scene material, the beat poets are dead, let them be. Read for yourself and its own rewards. That should be obvious; now go, enjoy this epic soul journey."
1,Westmoreland Identification & Value Guide,I was very disappointed in this book. I collect Westmoreland Milk Glass - primarily the grape panel pattern. There was very little in this book on milk glass. A true Westmoreland Glass book would have a great bit of it in there.
2,Easy to hold rattle,"This rattle is easy to hold and has an added advantage of being able to roll around the floor. This makes my grandson want to crawl after it. It's well made, makes a nice rattling sound. I would buy it again for my grandson as it is quite nice. He didn't show interest in it until about 7 months and now that he is one plays with it a bit. The only negative comment I have is that he loses interest in it after a very short time."
2,good and interesting read,"this book is a good read and jumps around a lot, but i enjoyed learning and reading it. thank you."
1,don't buy it,it has some nice features and it's too bad that you can't see them. everything is black. the grass is black. the bunkers are black. I can't see anything.
1,Stunk,I am a die hard stargate fan...this movie was really bad....wish that stargate would stop taking advantage of its loyal fan base by making this straight to DVD movies....end the series or put in back on the air...(i would have much prefered to pay $10 to go see on big screen vs buying the expensive dvd.)
2,Excellent compilation on Leadershipattributes for innovation,Excellent compilation on Leadership attributes for innovation and is a collection of well written articles which made me think and connect to a real world phenomenon. I enjoy reading Peter Drucker's books and the content of the book has Peter Drucker's flavor to it. The Clarity and style of this book is truly outstanding.
1,"When it says ""Highlights"", It really does mean just small snippets","I had read several other reviews for this dvd and was left unsure about it's content. Since it was cheap enough, I bought it anyway and I'll hold onto it. But I'm still mad I am unable to find a simple copy of the ENTIRE Opening Ceremony. So when it says ""Highlights"", It really does mean just snippets of clips. Some of the bands didn't even get to finish their songs. The OVER focusing on the US team was annoying too."
2,Very Funny!,"This movie was done by Hal Roach, who was also responsible for Laurel and Hardy. I thought it was pretty funny. If you liked Laurel and Hardy, you'll like this"
2,real good,"Had never heard of the guy - got it at a bookstore because it had 1200 pages (I needed a lot to read) and because it was written by an old guy (well, he's old now, at least - well- wrinkled but kind looking). So far I'm about a third of the way through it, but like everyone else has said, this book is great. Some writers get lazy and write the same story over and over. Not this guy - every character, every situation is unique. For people who like movies, read the one about Istafan and compare it to ""Lost in Translation"". The story about the swingers party is indescribably great also, just in the way he describes a man kissing a woman's hair or them barely dancing at all."
1,Keep looking if you want a portable mixer,"I purchased this unit for its battery powered portable usage. It fails miserably as it produces so much hiss it is unusable. I mean it is poor with a captital P.The phantom power does not work when in battery mode, nor does the clipping LED's. Keep on looking if you want portability."
2,Entertaining Pulp Fiction,"Civil War veteran John Carter is carried away to Mars. There, he impresses the giant green Tharks with his hand-to-hand combat skills, falls in love with Princess Dejah Thoris, and has many adventures. Very fun escapist yarn. Totally implausible, but never really asks you to take it seriously. Pure wish-fulfillment heroic fantasy. Burroughs' prose is a bit archaic and stilted, and some plot twists were too extraordinary to be satisfying. Overall, however, Princess is very entertaining pulp fiction."
2,"Beautiful, high quality necklace!","This necklace is absolutely gorgeous! The chain is a nice, thick one, not too small and delicate. The stones are a very clear, vibrant blue. Can't wait to wear it for my wedding!"
1,Only Windows XP and earlier Support,"This scanner works great but if you want to update the unit or use their printing software you can only run their drivers on a Windows XP machine or earlier. Windows XP is over 10 years old. You can't load the data from the scanner into your computer if you have Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8. They seem to have no plan to update their system for this scanner or any of the EZ Scan line.Keep in mind Microsoft is dropping support for Windows XP in spring of 2014, a little more than a year away. Why don't they have something that works with more current computers especially when you can only buy one with Windows 7 or mostly now with Windows 8.In addition, for most of their models the firmware is 4.07 and I believe the 07 stands for 2007 as that's as current as the unit shows for cars. If you have a car 2008 and later it doesn't show. Have to ask why they don't want to update the software for their products and still expect people to buy them."
2,Excellent,"I have two sandisk cruzer flash drives, and i have to say, they're great. The first one i got has been with me for years, and it's still working great.The retractable usb connector elliminates the need of a cap, so you never have to worry about loosing it. The materials are very high quality, and the U3 software is usefull for some applications.In my opinion, this is the best usb flash drive out there.I actually started trusting sandisk after this, and went to the store to buy a sansa e260, wich is great too."
1,Awful,These diapers are terrible. I'm not sure the diapers in the box are actually Pampers. They leak--and not just out the legs or up the back. Right through the part of the diaper that is supposed be the most absorbent. The box says they are good for 12 hour overnight protection--a joke. Maybe three hours. Every time I've used these overnight my baby (14 lbs) has woken up soaked.
2,Works out of the box with Tivo HD-XL and Tivo Series 2 DVR,Recently bought the Tivo AGO100 wireless adapter. Plugged it into my TiVO HD-XL recorder. Followed the on-screen instruction to connect to my home network/internet. Just worked out of the box. Less than 10 minutes to get connected and start using the network services (able to stream netflix movies and other features). I also plugged it into my old Tivo Series 2 recorder and it also worked. The price was lowest on Amazon and ordered a two day Amazon prime delivery. Amazon surprised me by delivery it one day! Great service andgreat product so far!!
2,Cool!,"4 stars for now, haven't used it, as it is a gift for my uncle. Packaging was nice, shipped on time, and no damage from what I can see. Will update review once my uncle uses it."
1,This is not the real Pio - Read Ruffin's Bio if you want to know that,"Yes the movie is ""beautiful and touching"" as another reviewer stated. However, it is also quite wrong. I have read just about every biography of Padre Pio published in English (and there are many) and can assure you that you must read credible biographical works before you see this film if you want to know the real Padre Pio. Then if you still want to view this movie, you can sit down and spot the outrageous errors in the movie.Question: Why would anyone interested in learning the truth about this remarkable man watch a movie that is loaded with mistakes and distortions?Recommended: Right here on Amazon you can order Lutheran minister Bernard C. Ruffin's biography of Padre Pio. It is an excellent way to get the facts!"
1,You've Got to be Kidding,"For all those who compare Ruben and Clay, there is no comparison. Ruben won b/c he is a true talent. While Clay had to be ""made over"", Ruben is still Ruben. I listened to Clay's first 5 songs and had to turn it off. While he can sing other peoples songs well he cannot hold a tune to his own album. I was extremely disappointed, and would not buy this CD."
1,Good prints... bad compatibility,"I've had the P1000 for a couple of years. Worked great with WindowsME. After installing XP on my desktop I had to reinstall the printer software to get it to work. Just got a new laptop and it doesn't work at all.. in fact, the P1000 causes my Dell Inspiron to crash whenever I disconnect the USB cable. When the cable is connected the laptop never recognizes the printer."
1,Cheese enthroned,"This is like a new genre of music - cheese metal, it sucks so bad that you don't even get angry with it, rather you feel sorry for the poor people in this god-awful band, and all the people who were misled into buying this or any other nightwish cd. The sound is like total cheesy motoristic rock with ridicules dickenson-like vocals distorted in the worst possible way...Ok if i had to pick one cd i would suggest you NOT to buy, this would come in second only to limp bizkit's chocolate starfish......."
2,Stellar outing,"I'm very impressed with this outing by Kid Loco. One of the better DJKicks out there,just flows one song into another."
2,Great space saver,This product is a great space saver and easy to put together. I keep the rack in the garage by my car and grab shoes off it on the way to work and other places. The rack is smaller than I thought which is good. It does not take up much space and allows me to keep lots of shoes on the same rack. It's very sturdy so there is no worry about it tipping over or shoes falling off.
2,THE GROUP THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN,"THIS GROUP DIDN'T RECEIVE THE ATTENTION THEY DESERVED. I OWN THIS CD, AND I PLAY IT CONSTANTLY. I OWN THE SINGLE OF 'HAVE I NEVER', AND I OWN THE FULL LENGTH CD. 'A FEW GOOD MEN' IS ONE OF BABYFACE'S BEST PROTÃ‰GÃ‰S. I WISH THEY WOULD MAKE ANOTHER CD."
1,"""Pampers Baby Dry Diapers"" - DO NOT BUY","DO NOT BUYIt does the job capturing urine fine,but it does not stop 3-4-month old baby thing feces comming out over the top of a diaper in the backIn our case, every other time our baby boy had bowel movement we had to copmletely change his clothing because of the leakageProduct link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VHSHCA"
1,Piece of Junk!!!,"Upon the third use, I started having the same problem as all the other 1-star people. The problem is with the auto input line sensing circuitry. Even with the auto-sensing switch in manual, the auto-sensing circuitry engages and disengages after every dynamic passage on a center channel home theater setup. When it engages and disengages the sound coming from the speaker connected to the amp also engages and disengages. I just ordered the Niles Audio SI-2125 to replace this piece of junk. Thanks Amazon for picking up the return shipping!"
2,this cd is tight,"Stacie Orrico is Christian's Britney Spears. (Thats not a bad thing though!!). This album is worth the money because this girl can sing. My fave tracks on here are: Ride, O.O. Baby (my fave song!!), Without Love, Genuine, So Pray, Restore My Soul, Confidant, and Dear Friend. The rest of the tracks are so-so. But get her CD anyway, and go get her X-mas album too!!"
2,"The most charming, captivating work from LJ Smith!","The plot and characters are incredible. Everyone that likes the supernatural should read this book, and all the other Night World books. I think I'm in love with Ash!"
1,Stopped Cold,"I had seen this authors' works offered for free on the Kindle page and since the price was right downloaded two of them. I was happily reading ""The Lamp In The Desert"" when I got to location 2458-61, and there in the middle of the page was the ""N"" word. Now I realize these books were written in a different time, and people had different morals and people were unenlightened, my problem now is, do I want to read a book written by someone so obviously contemptuous of me, no matter what decade the writer lived and worked in? I think the answer is NO! I was truly enjoying the book up until location 2458-61, and had even gone so far as to call my sister and recommend them to her. I am truly trying to be a bigger person and but I cannot truly support people who do not respect me. I am deleting this book and the ""Rosa Mundi and Other Stories"" today. Life is hard enough and I shouldn't have to fell insulted by something I bring into my home for pleasure. Sorry Ethel, ya gotta go!"
2,Comfortable and stylish enough,"I like black sneakers best because you can pull them off going to casual social things like neighborhood parties, cookouts, etc. and they dont look dumpy.these are comforatable and break in nicely."
1,So HOT it caught on FIRE!!!,Purchased this item and it caught on fire during its first use. I had it plugged in for about 3 minutes when my sons bottle and product caught on fire. I do not recommend this item. When I called the company they requested that I spend my own money to return the item and if they found that it was a mechanical failure they would replace the item only after I paid shipping. When I asked about my bottle they said their was nothing they could do about my loss. (Fire had caused the bottle lid to fuse to the bottom)This product is not worth a penny.
1,Another fast book? Object databases for OO beginners -Why?,"If you don't already know and understand the basic object terminology explained in this book, you probably don't need to start with a book on object databases. I would also read the reviews of this author's other books. They are mostly very bad. This author seems to write more book than anyone could write and do a good job - even if they wrote fulltime - much less if they taught college as this author claims to. This book is probably not worth the money or your time."
2,Excellent Sci-Fi,"James Alan Gardner is one of my new favorite authors. In Expendable, he has created a new and exciting universe peopled by characters who breathe and live between the pages. Some aspects of this book were predictable. However, it is still a page turner.I found it interesting that he wrote this book from the viewpoint of a female. It is written in first person perspective.The book is also a study of human nature and behavior. It has some funny bits, some poignant bits and a lot of great imagery. This is an excellent book. Honestly, it is one of the best ""first"" books I have read.Right after this book, I read ""Commitment Hour"" also by this author. Gardner's second book, it is also well worth checking out, if you can get past the premise. I'll also write a review about that book."
2,A great help!!,"What I appreciate most about this book is the author's honesty and candid writing. Because she too has suffered, she can relate to the reader's feelings of denial, grief and loss. Each entry is comforting, thought provoking, and will allow you to go at your own pace. I read some things more than once and skipped around, too, to whatever was appropriate for how I felt at the time. A must have if you have lost a loved one, or know someone who is dealing with this situation. It's just like talking to a good friend."
1,Badly Written and Boring,"Escape Under Prssure was one big bore. A group of eighth graders could have written something better.The dialog is just plain stupid. I understand that the writer of this movie has gone back to working for a lawn maintenance company, and is given nothing more complicated than trimming shrubs."
2,they help,"Been using these for the past 6 mos. My gums have always bled cause I only flossed before going to the dentist (about every 6 mos or so), regular floss never really worked me, my teeth were too close together. The last visit my dentist said my gums were getting inflamed and was getting the periodontal thing. I researched alternatives to the floss and found these, also researched the proper way to brush teeth and started using the total care mouthwash. My gums stopped bleeding after about a month of using these and I would use the regular floss about twice a month just to get a little more thorough removal of junk in there. These could be a little more sturdy on the brush end of them as I have had a few bend and had to throw out but that's a few out of 250 which isn't bad. My next dentist appt is in a month so i'll see what they say. Hopefully they'll say , wow!"
1,Very disappointed,"This was an adorable bird feeder that was supposed to deter squirels, but it didn't sending the feeder crashing to the ground."
1,Not bad until she starts . . . whatever that is.,"Screaming? More like being strangled. How could they possibly have played that back and decided it was a good idea? Pity, because otherwise the mixture of good girl vocals and hard chunky guitars, combined with good hooks in the songwriting department is very pleasing to the ears. And then . . . they decide to put a plastic bag over her head and mic her yelling. Bizarre; almost every track starts out compelling and becomes unlistenable to the point of being laughable."
2,Fall,"A Brilliant Album that I proudly promote on my shows. I can play any track and loveeeeeee it. ""Average Joe"" is one that has my listeners asking for again. Going to start promoting ""She Loves it in the Morning"" as that is the single Clay has out. If you are looking for great country ""Fall"" is an album you should have in your collection."
1,An Expensive Jack Chick Comic,"i wish I could give this book no stars.I would have to strongly disagree that Steve Berry did a good job of researching this book. Steve Berry does not know the difference between doctrine and rule or excommunication and censure. As a fallen-away Catholic, he probably did his research by listening to the lies and misconceptions promulgated in anti-Catholic websites and chat rooms. It is very clear that Steve Berry has major conflicts with the doctrine and rules of the Catholic Church and justifies his leaving the Church by writing about how horrible and evil it is.I was unable to go through much of the book because of the overwhelming anti-Catholic bias. This novel is just one more of the many novels that will be used by anti-Catholic bigots in their attacks on Catholics and Catholicism. Don't spend your money on this garbage."
2,essential,Essential original versions of some of the countlessly versioned riddims that made reggae great. A true masterpiece of Reggae.
1,disapointment in Belgistan,"After purchasing the first in this series of DVDs, I was eagerly awaiting the next one in the series. However I was disapointed in this vid. Their were less episodes on this disk than the first one and fewer extras. I will admit that the story is still excellent, although frustrating at times, and the animation is superb. ... I would rather buy the Robotech legacy DVD or even Fight Club instead of this vid.Sincerely:David C. Eberhart II"
1,Could this be worse?,"Without the studio trickery, he would be doing community college musicals. The make-over doesn't do it for me either. I wouldn't spend the money and I'd give it away if it were given to me. What new lows will America's talent standards slip to?"
2,If you like SF this is the one book you should read,"If you have the patience to read the first 100 pages you'll not be able to put this book aside.The first time I read this book I was 14. I've probably read it a dozen times by now. The plot is extremely good. The outcomes of every event (since the group leaves Trantor) are surprising, the way the main heroes solve the problems are exciting and satisfying (to me at least). The good amount of dialogues keeps the book from becoming boring and overly descriptive.Asimov's imagination is as yet unsurpassed!"
1,Cut smaller than usual,"I agree, these are cut small... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do. The waist band does NOT stretch."
1,No Lao-to-English!,"This phrasebook looks reasonable in most respects, but it has no Lao to English dictionary. That means, if you are trying to communicate with someone who does not speak english, they cannot respond to you with words, even if they are motivated and patient enough to try to carry on a conversation.The description of this book said it had a ""comprehensive dictionary"". Unfortunately, it only has half of a comprehensive dictionary. If you want a book that will make it possible to actually converse with a Lao speaker, this is not it."
1,fire hazard,"I replaced an old Betty Crocker warmer due to age (20 years) with this, ironically because I thought I may be pushing my luck with ancient wiring. The first time out of the gate, I left the house with the warmer on for hours...the on/off indicator light is so dim I can only see the glow if I cup my hand over the light to shade it. Scared me enough to pull my old one back out, it has an automatic shutoff that would have prevented my potentially dangerous oversight. And warms better anyway!"
1,Can't believe I wasted my money,"This worked for about a month, then the scanner function ceased to work except by accessing it through the computer, in other words, you couldn't put a photo in it and push the scan button but had to go thru the computer. Now even that doesn't work. The troubleshooting they have is extremely complicated/pure gibberish.What a piece of junk."
2,Male only spaces,"I would have NEVER picked up Sherlock Holmes on my own! I'm so glad my English teacher assigned this to read (I wrote my paper on the male only space Doyle created, not megatively or anything). The book was pretty creepy at times, shocking! I was never bored, but then again it was so short. I loved the legend of the hound mystery and all of Holmes' deductions to solve the crime. Good times."
1,This movie insulted my intelligence...,"along with the new Starwars. It is one of those movies that you want your 8 bucks and 2 hours of your life back afterwards. The plot is lame. The psycho-thriller classic turns a flop & dumb special effects-fest. I recommend ""the Matrix"" ""Taxi Driver (remastered)"" etc. for your holiday viewing."
2,Janet!!!,Janet is at her best in this excellent concert! I love this video and have seen many concerts... This it top entertainment!! I recommend it highly.Janet Jackson - The Velvet Rope Tour (Live in Concert) (DTS)
1,Worst diapers- Ever.,"I ordered these before our son was born. At the time, I didn't know the difference between the swaddlers and the baby dry. Well, I learned the hard way as these leak like CRAZY. I cannot convey how truly awful these are. Please spare yourself the pain and don't get these diapers. Baby dry is awful."
1,Very disappointing,"I have previously bought three other books in this series; this anthology is, by far, the weakest of the four.I really don't care to read about some sheep called Brillo, who appears to be the main character up to page 185.Very disappointing, save your money."
1,What happened to the violence?,what went wrong with Robocop? The first two are violent and watchable but this one is a disappoint and is only entertaining to a point.
1,Unbeliavable....,"So they release a DVD to say how good ""Back in Black"" is (as if we needed to be remembered of that...) and they put a photo at the front cover with SIMON WRIGHT in the line-up, instead of Phil Rudd! Wright joined the band THREE YEARS after the recording of ""Back in Black"".This fact alone is a very good omen of the real intentions of this product: to make easy and fast money and offering nothing new about this classic rock album. Useless."
2,Excellent for quick grating of hard items,"This is another high quality item from microplane. I use this regularly. Its quick and easy to pull out and grate some cheese. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 only because this does a great job grating hard cheeses like parmesan, but is not a good choice for grating softer cheeses like mozarella. For softer items, I use a small rotary shredder by zyliss."
1,troubling turn for Anyon,"Anyon wrote a provocative article a number of years ago which I still use in my teacher education classes. But this new book is troubling to me. She fails to look at the national systemic causes of institutional racism and seems to blame those in the local schools. I don't know New Jersey - maybe she is right about that city. But I do know other urban districts, and it is natioanl systems of testing, curriculum, funding, bureaucracy, and irrelevant teacher credentialing which oppresses both those who attempt to educate and those who attempt to be educated. The African-American teachers in New Jersey tried to tell Anyon that, but she didn't listen."
2,Big Brother is watching you...,"Orwell's 1984 seems to grow increasingly relevant with every passing year.1984 tells the story of Winston Smith, who's job is ""correcting"" historical documents and removing words from the dictionary. He is a drone in the machine that is the Party, the ruling power of Oceania. Every thought, movement, and gesture is watched through telescreens by a policing force called the Thought Police. Big Brother, the figurehead of the Party, is revered and loved, and any thought otherwise is punishable by death.Whatever trace of humanity that lies in Winston causes him to seek answers, question his reality, and pursue a forbidden realtionship with a woman named Julia, all which lead to a frightful and thought provoking end.This book should be a staple in every person's library. Orwell's satire has withstood the test of time, and has inspired a countless number of books and films. A classic in every sense."
2,"Regina Carter., Motor City Moments, I'll Be Seeing You, Paganini After A Dream.","I'm reviewing all three Albums together as they are by the same artist; Regina Carter. Again I purchased these Albums on the basis of a 30 sec listen. They all lived up to my expectations. If anyone is familiar with Stephane Grapelli, Regina Carter's style is very similar. She really swings. I love these albums and play them over and over again."
1,Not Happy With This Camera,"I have many digital cameras, thought I would try the V705.The anti blur technology does not work very good, if at all.Doesnt support high speed SD cards.Uses Hi Compression, no way to change it = low quality Pictures.Quick Time Video is not a good mode, I would like AVISCN Custom mode is a joke.I talked to Kodak about these things and they are sorry.I will stick with a Winner, hp R817."
2,One of my favorites,"First tried this product as a freebie during hotel stay in Dubai and bought a bottle immediately on arriving home. This was years ago now and I still re-order it frequently. Medium level fresh scent that lasts most of day, excellent as both bath/shower gel, does not leave skin sticky or dry."
2,Batman Begins,"Batman Begins is a really good movie. I enjoyed it because it wasn't like the comic book depictions I have seen in the past. It was more for an adult audience and showed how he got to be Batman and why. It didn't have all the silly, stupid things that the old movies had. It was more like a drama and my whole family really enjoyed it. Christian Bale was excellent as Batman and everyone in the movie did a terrific job."
2,Quick read,"Love Langston Hughes' poetry, but this was a nice departure. I would recommend this book to any young person who has not read anything by Langston."
2,SUPERB,This toy took a little getting use to. But after a few times playing with it I was amazing. I wish there were more options for the speed & vibration but It makes me quite happy & I'm not always easy to please. ;-)
1,dis movie SSUUCCKKSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i see dis movie in dis theter it blew chunks spongbob an his friends are gay
2,Direct Hit,"This is the best action movie I've ever seen. I've never been a big fan of techno music before, but it is used so effectively in this movie that I found myself drawn to the soundtrack afterward. If you can appreciate cinematography like a fast-paced music video, you will absolutely love this film - guaranteed."
2,"Spine Chilling, Awesome, and Grand!","I can not say enough about Nightwish, masterpeice in all meanings of the word. If I had to chose one CD to be stranded with on a desert island, this is it! All Nighwish is good but this is there greatest, and most epic. Tarja has the most amazing voice, and makes this metal in a catagory all it's own. You have just got to hear it, I can explain the way this album can make you feel. The classical of the future!"
1,not worth the money,"My son really wanted this toy, he recieved it as a gift. The tower falls off if you look at it wrong, I will have to epoxy it to the base. It is expensive and does not come with any teen titans. Buy the figures and build your own tower/fort for them."

2,for Stevie,Bought this for my daughter for a course she was taking at UF called Women in Films. It arrived very promptly at her address.
2,A very hot read!,"Ray Bradbury's story of how he wrote this genius book in the UCLA basement on a manual typewriter at 10-cents an hour is such a perfect start. The nine days in dimes that he spent came to so much good. This is a classic because it is science-fiction that predicts our world today. If you look closely, you'll see ipods and cell phones and flatscreen TVs in Bradbury's artistic vision. The message is obvious but insidious. We know that books are the knowledge of our anscestors, that writing is ideas and that without them we would be vapid, yet we still don't actually get it. Bradbury has created a world with evil every bit as tempting as our own, then turns it all around into a greater good. It's magic!"
1,Keep looking - this ain't it!,"I have to agree with the ""lousy"" review. It seems to be a decent setup,but if you need a light more intense than any naturally available, what is the point? HP needs to get this fixed so it is much more sensitive to light and can operate with a faster ""shutter"" speed to prevent blur and also produce something other than an extremely dark picture. I wasn't looking for something that great with a 1.3 MP camera, but this was a total loss. Can you say Return Merchandise Authorization?"
1,failed after 2nd application,"i never got this to work, it shorted out and is made out of cheap plastic. didn't come with all the attachments would not recommend this product"
2,Good service,I was pleased with the condition of the book and the speed with which I received it. Thanks.
1,"Don't buy the dvd, and don't buy into the fabricated 5 star reviews","I purchased this as a video, and was not that impressed. It has nice surf footage, but the yoga instruction is really bad. The time would have been better spent slowing going through each yoga pose, versus racing through a large number of poses. Skip this DVD, take a lesson at your local yoga place."
2,"Very Smooth Ride thru Vatican & ""Proof"" of God..!","An aging German pope sends our hero, Michener, on a mission to find the true hidden secrets of the message given by the Virgin to the children of Fatima in 1917. Meanwhile the Pope's Secretary, a scoundrel of the highest order, has his sights set on his life long ambitions of becoming the next pope. In a breathless search through medieval papal archives and to Bosnia, the site of the latest Mary apparition, we are led to a nifty grand finale, as all the pieces fit together to a final ""Proof"" of the Virgin's Mary's Reality, and God's existence as well. This is a lively ride thru Church/ Papal history with interesting characters and settings to match, and I admit I breezed right thru!"
2,McCulloch 1800 PSI Electric Pressure Washer,"I like it. I live on the west side of the Cascade Range in Oregon and things get dingy pretty quick. I had my vehicle, the rain gutters on the house, landscaping bricks along the path around the house, and odds and ends all washed in about an hour. It works great. The only drawback that I can find is that it doesn't appear to suck up any cleaning solution in the high pressure mode. Only the low pressure. I haven't tried the upper tank yet so maybe that's the problem. Not a huge issue since plain water pretty much takes everything off anyway. The plastic double male hose attachment was a concern before I purchased the unit. I'd read that most of them broke pretty quick. As long as you are aware not to stress it out dragging it around, it will probably last a good long time. If it does break it should be easy to replace pretty cheap. Again great unit so far."
1,Rosemarys Boring,"This movie was not as good as it seems. When i first rented it, I thought it was going to be pretty good considering I like classic horror films. But to my belief, it was very boring. The begining was pretty interesting with the couple looking for an appartment to rent, and the dead body in the begining/middle. But after a while it was very bland. Especially the part where she gets pregnant. I actually laughed during one part where she was ""floating on a bed in the middle of the ocean"". I rated it one star only because of the connections the movie made at the end with all of its characters. There was only one exciting part where i was saying to myself, ""finally"" but then it ended very quickly. I thought her decision was ludacris at the end. Don't waist two hours like i did watching this film."
1,"Initially interesting, eventually saw through him . . .","It was recommended to me by someone whom I think beleives in the interdimensional and non-ET aspect of it all. I kept an open mind, but finally came to the conclusion that John Keel wrote a fradualent and contrived story, with an underlying ""distracted"" attitude that in reality is quite insulting to the reader. The book is probably pure fiction, and if you seek more than fiction, then it is bordering on pure trash. As an ""investigator"" he poorly documents his findings. Don't buy it, check it out from the library, please."
1,WTF????????,"This album is able to be previewed in full on NME.com If I were you I would go there to find out just what you're about to endure. This album sucks extremely bad. I have not heard anything this half assed in all but two weeks. This garbage getting good reviews is only an indication of the white reviewers out there trying to make this seem cooler than it isn'nt. The beats are exactly the same on every track. Handclaps and half rhythms are only one tenth of the awkwardness on this record. I dont think that anyone with fully functioning ears would like this record, unless they think it makes them look different. For the most part, there is nothing innovative on this record. This is what bad pop music will sound like in ten years. MIA has recorded a travesty ahead of her time. Once again, go to NME.com and preview this before you actully waste your money on this. The sound of this record could have been reproduced with a kettle drum and sticks banging together in a long hall."
1,Not translated very well for Kindle,I am in no way knocking the author's writing. Whoever transfered this book did not do a good job. The story is disjointed and when turning the page does not match up with what was just read. From what I can make of this story it was good andnot a long read. Of course i have no idea how much is missing.
1,no bueno.,"This leaves your skin dry & not lumenescent like the other neo strata aha lotion. Tingles must work, but your skin does not look smoother afterwards."
2,I'm sooo happy,I am sooo happy now that I finally have this DVD - rarely recognized fantastic film noir - Joan's best and Jack Palance's first movie break. Riveting. Arrived on time and in perfect condition!
2,This is the Best book ever written!!!,"I wish I Could give this book a 100! I read this book about 3 times a year, and never do get bored with it !!! ----WARNING----- This book is so absorbing,do not read it on a day where you have something planned.There is a 99.99999% chance you will!!!!"
2,Other than the four page long paragraphs...,"Okay...So the run on sentences and the page long paragraphs get a little old and annoying...However, under all of this is a very intriguing mystery novel...Who actually killed Vinson Gowrie and how did Jake Montgomery end up in his grave? Read and find out! However, one must be patient with Faulkner for he makes you work for every element of the story you get from his books...He's also one of those authors that you just have to keep reading...Re-reading pages isn't the best idea..."
2,John Steinbeck May Be The Best Author Ever,"Despite the length of this novel, it contains a powerful plot that will leave any reader heart-broken. The author describes the settings in such detail you can almost smell the alfalfa. As far as the plot goes, he leaves room for your imagination to fill in the blanks and gives the plot life through drama and issues that any worker would face during the early 1900s. Of mice and men, it is a must-read for any reading level.The setting is based in the early 1900s, where Lennie and George, the two main characters, work for a new employer on a swamp. The author creates great detail not only through words, but also through the actions of other characters. For example, the author never once mentions Lennie's mental disability. Instead, he uses actions and dialogue to show that he is. John Steinbeck is a magnificent author, and he has my regards."
2,Wonderful,"I read The Secret just before reading this one. It was a wonderful lead-in to Ransom. I couldn't put this book down. I feel in love with Broderick and Gillian. And it was great to include Iain & Judith Maitland. You always wonder what happens to the characters in the other books, and it's great when you see what happens to them."
1,Too Restrictive to allow air volume needed.,"Plug has a tiny hole that is too restrictive to allow enough air volume through to do an adequate job. Hole may be small to attempt ""reduce"" pressure but that is not a satisfactory way to reduce pressure anyway. Need to reduce pressure on compressor regulator to avoid blowing out lines in RV Make you own adapter using a piece of garden hose, and the appropriate adapters to do a satisfactory job of removing all water from you RV lines for winter storage."
2,a note about sizing,"If you didn't already know, make sure you order 1/2 a size smaller then you normally would when ordering Converse.Love these shoes."
2,Possibly the Best out of this series!,"It was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L.J. Smith and her writing. I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness, yet this book remains dear to my heart. The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel...but you will especially fall in love with Ash. Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance. This book is fantastic!"
2,Advice to potential buyers,"Just wanted to mention a few things the other reviewers didn't. This player supports the WMA format which iPOD does not. I have the 8GB unit and expanded it with a 4GB MicroSD card. After adding the Micro SD card, the unit took about 90 seconds to start up, and battery life was reduced from 3 hours to about 30 minutes! Overall, I love it as a MP3 player, but would recommend you go with a unit with 16GB built-in storage if you think you'll need that much room."
1,ORIGINAL MUCH BETTER,THE ORIGINIAL OF THIS MOVIE WAS MUCH BETTER. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS IN THIS REMAKE ARE BETTER-BUT THE PLOT IS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL.
2,Interesting performance,"I bought this only because as a fan, I want all of their material. First off, you'll notice the disc length of 76.46. The band added a keyboard player Graham Maitland for this tour which at first is a bit hard to digest(mixed too far up front)sometimes the keyboards work, other times not. There are some classics here- 'The king will come', 'Persephone', 'Time Was' as well as a few others. Sound quality is average, sounds like a straight transfer with no doctoring with the sound. This is the Mark 2 lineup with Laurie Wisefield. Not one of the best concert offerings by the band but worthwhile. I'm sure the band has some real gems in their archive like the live tracks on the superb 'Distillation' box set. Sadly they are not contained on this disc. If you can get past the keyboards and the muddy sound quality, you may enjoy it. Somehow I feel only the true fans will want this disc in their collection."
1,Hatebreed is kind of awful,"Hatebreed's just another pesky ""hardcore"" band destroying the scene. A bunch of...guys yelling about beliefs that aren't even their own? Sounds kind of like Slipknot. That's not the hardcore mentality, ...Hatebreed is the assumed forerunner of Victory Records, keeping good bands like Grade, Shelter, and Snapcase from playing main stage. Instead, they have to open up for a cross between nu-metal and rock and roll."
1,Cheap and dangerous,"Though I've had this only about a month, it is starting to go. It puts shards of sharp plastic in the food. (From searching the net on this, I find that my experience is not unique, either.)Do NOT buy.Other better brands include Unicorn (recommended by a famous cooking magazine), Peugeot, Firth, and William Bounds."
2,Variedad,"Bueno tener este album debido a su sonido peculiar, algunas de sus canciones hasta fueron programadas aca en la radio en Guanatos...es + el Kala (Rostros Ocultos) se encargÃ³ de hacer un cover el cual fue un exito en espaÃ±ol - con los Smithreens nunca lo fue - (""Tiempo de Cambiar"" o ""Something New""). Saludos de neta. Mork"
2,This was a fine movie,I'm really baffled why everyone thinks this movie was quite so bad. Keanu Reeves does a fine job of playing exactly what the character was. There are some places where I would have liked to know a lot more. My hope is that perhaps the dvd edition will include some deleted scenes or an ext version. Its not a bad movie despite these odd reviews. If you were expecting another matrix perhaps... /shrug
1,Terrible compared to other volumes in the series,"I love history books and have read just about all the books in this series.This one was very weak. It starts out okay, but as you go along, it just becomes what other reviewers have noted - a very opinionated, biased piece. But even more than that, the book stops reading as history and more as narrative mishmash of events with the ever present biased commentary.I hate putting books down once started but it took me the better part of two years to get to the end of this. I could only take a few pages at a time and then I'd have to set it aside for a while.Anyway, all I can say is this was a major disappointment."
1,Just Don't,"Bad. Just bad. Somebody was on drugs during the making of this movie, I suspect it may have been multiple people. lol"
1,low volume,"While I expected the CD to occasionally skip, I was disappointed in how low the volume was.I had a Sony Discman and the volume was low on that, but with this player it's ridiculous."
2,Not taught in 9th grade American History,"This was a hard one to put down. In vivid but tight language, the story of the Essex is gripping and the details of the culture of whaling and the hard life at sea are intriguing and informative. In the end we get to see how religion, social position and greed play together to tell the grim sort of story we rarely acknowledge as part of our American history. Well worth the time and suitable for non-historians for its high adventure. It made me want a big steak."
2,Listen Compute Rock Home,"I received this record as a gift and have listened to it over and over with my friends at school. Many of the items are great for kids, but my friends and I love the psychedelic music and sound effects. My current favorite is ""Army Ants in Your Pants""...very imaginative!"
2,Rick Astley...Never Gonna Give You Up!!,"Yeah...Never Gonna Give you Up, Never Gonna let you down...! Rick Astley's two Top Chart nos. 'Together Forever' n 'Never gonna give you up' are so great that you love to see him sway on the floor dancing if you can ever grab a copy of the video! He's got the innocence, the voice and the charms. I have one of Rick's album n the video tracks but this one's the Best compilation with a mix of all numbers as I see there on the CD - indeed the Greatest Hits that hit the charts in US & UK. Its so much a soul singing of the UK singer Rick, he is superb with his vocals and all his numbers are musical, touching the heart! I specially luv 'Together forever...Never gonna give you up...Hold me in your arms and Whenver you need somebody. Never Gonna give u up has beautiful words and heart warming and the way he repeats Never gonna give...never gonna give....is so lovely to listen - Greatest Hits sure is a pick! Listen n enjoy!"
2,pretty good documentary,"overall, the documentary was pretty cool. however, about 99% of the beach boys clips were from a prior documentary, an american family from '85. they should have included the clip of dennis singing manson's song never learnt not to love (aka cease to exist). especially since the title of the movie is the beach boys & the satan. but did have cool footage of interviews with dick dale and dean torrence and the chantays. also kim fowley was cool too."
1,Microbiology Mystified,What a waste of paper. Nothing useful in here at all. This is more for a third grader than an adult taking a college course. Find a better book or you will be sorrowfully disappointed.
1,Uh...,"Constantine was the corniest movie I think i've ever seen.I don't remember much of it because I was so busy cussing under my breath about wasting $8.50 on such nonsense. I haven't ever rolled my eyes, sucked my teeth, or scoffed so much in my entire life. I almost fell out of my seat when Keanu Reeve's gave the devil the finger. Talk about pure cheese."
1,Great story... but not on the kindle,"I read a review for a free version of this for the kindle that suggested you spend a buck or two to get a decent copy. Apparently the free version has more than its share of issues. I figured this was still reasonably priced at $0.99, so gave it a shot. It's more or less readable, but the frequency of errors is just inexcusable... even if it is less than a dollar. There are random breaks in mid-paragraph and mid-sentence (random meaning there is no apparent reason for it; they actually show up pretty consistently), missing words at the start of chapters or paragraphs, and several typos (typos that don't exist in the print version I also bought).The story itself is an easy 5 stars. There have to be better versions out there, though."
2,Review,A brilliant piece of work. The genius use of foreshadowing definitely keeps the reader wanting more. It is definitely a greAt novel.
2,The battery that saved the wedding,"With the new memory cards the digital cameras take HUNDREDS of pictures which is great .... until the message ""Low Battery""! This time I remembered four days before my son's wedding that I need a spare battery! Ran to the mall, to the electronics stores, but nobody had it. The answer was "" contact the manufacturer"". There was no time for that, except AMAZON.COM. Two days later arrived to my house! That's service! Of course I was able to take thousands of pictures and save my son's wedding!"
1,Wrong Region,"Not really sure how the whole region thing works, or which region I live in. It's obviously not region 2, because this disc, although in great condition, refuses to play in any dvd player around. Will be returning it if possible. Shipping time was excellent though, it arrived two weeks ahead of the expected arrival date."
2,It really breaks loose!,"When all hell breaks loose, it really breaks loose. The main character Greg is a positive role model and has it going on in his life. His business is booming, his friends are challenging and things are working well with the lady love in his life, enough so that he proposes.As in real life, what happens when things go well, all hell breaks loose and when you think it cannot get any worse, it does.This is a page turner and a nice debut novel. It is easy to complete in one setting. It was easy to predict what was going to happen in the end and the author took a few twist to arrive there. One downfall was that the prediction came to early in the book if you are a suspense reader, but it did not detract from the book. A little more developing of the characters will come as Ms. Spencer continues to write, and I expect we will receive more writings from this author."
2,Music for the 21st Century,"This is one fantastic CD.The combination of musicians that are on this CD take the music to another place. I am a big Miles Davis fan and first heard of Jason Miles when I got TuTu many years ago.On this Cd he has managed to create a musical universe that I have not heard on a CD for quite sometime. It's funky,lush,melodic,hard hitting and has the musical integrity that many Cds that try to be commercial don't have.I played this for my 17 year old son and he just loved it.The music has the ability to speak to alot of different audiences and age groups.I love the track Voices on The Corner. It's music that I've never heard before.I agree with the reviewer here who can't figure out why Jason Miles isn't a household name. Hopefully this CD will change that"
2,Read it!,Why are you sitting there? Get up and read this book. It may show you how human you really are...
2,Burning Books!,"This is said to be the temperature at which books ignite. The concept of the novel was satirical. The book was set in a sort of parallel universe or alternate reality that says that a government has taken over, which has outlawed books and goes into people's homes and sets the books on fire. There is a law against books even in schools, this seems insane, and the backlash to an idea such as this is the current popularity of books today then the alternative to books, would be the ebook."
2,Second 510 purchased in two years; both are excellent,"I bought my first Xerox DocuMate 510 in mid-2008. It works so well that when I wanted to replace an aging scanner for another office machine, I simply bought it again. I am running Win XP (paid extra not to get VISTA when I bought new machines) and find this scanner, combined with PaperPort 11, works beautifully. I do not use the ""single touch"" software that comes with it, having long since learned to use PaperPort for all scanning, so I cannot comment on its functionality. The machine itself does everything it saws, without error."
1,"Magical, mystical piece of tripe","I read (well, not really...I got to page 100 and felt like I'd read it three times already) this book over ten years ago and I still rank it as the worse piece of tripe that I ever had the misfortune to come across. But I'm biased. Like most Latins, I think the whole ""magical and mysterious"" cloak with which Latin literature is viewed abroad is unfortunate, but ultimately it's that kind of rubbish that sells."
1,Negative undertones,"This book scared me to death when I was pregnant. NONE of the terrible things it described happened to me. I feel it was also very one-sided. I agree the reviewer #1, The book made you feel bad ! Like being pregnant with twins was going to be a terrible experince, beware!The book was just so negative! I threw it in the garbage after I had the babies!"
2,"Gad Zuks, Batman!","No calories, no carbs, just great taste to add to coffee anywhere you are. I keep it in my purse. This stuff is great!"
2,Holy Crap!!!,"This was my first Rabbit and I highly recommend it. It was a replacement of one vibe I had and it was just the plane old plane old, but this thing blows it out of the water literally. Its fun by myself and with my husband. I just really have nothing bad to say, other then the fact it takes me now about 30 sec. But I'm not sure if that's a bad thing."
2,Cyndi surpasses her debut!,"It's rare for a sophomore release to surpass an artist's debut; but this is one album that seems to have done just that. I loved Cyndi's debut, but this album exceeded my expectations, which we all know is rare with most sophomore releases. Although she's Australian, Cyndi has a deep, rich, bluesy voice, that sounds like she grew up in the backwoods of the deep South. This is the quintessential of stripped down, bluesy, country roots music."
1,not satisfied,Packaged poorly......two bottles of the cleaning supplies were busted open.I had to throw away the entire order due to the other contents being drenchedwith the other chemicals. Very dissatisfied!!
2,The closest thing to time travel,"This is the first book since ""A Night to Remember"" that actually carries you back through time to the decks of the sinking Titanic until you actually feel it yourself. You feel the emotions of the people that night - and then you are yanked forward in time to the expeditions that first discovered and explored the Titanic, and then Pellegrino moves you back and forth in time again and again from the night of the sinking to the expeditions until at last you become, like James Cameron's Rose, unstuck in time. It is easy to see how Cameron was so moved by Pellegrino's morphings through time. A reading of this scientist's other books reveals that he seems to be unable to tell a tale in linear fashion. In both ""Unearthing Atlantis"" and ""Ghosts of the Titanic,"" he unfolds archaeological investigations by telling the whole history backwards! It is difficult to imagine what he will do with time next. But I'll be there for the ride. You can bet on it."
1,dissapointing,dissapointing in that the duets really do little justice to the songs. The duet5s in particular have beengiven inappropriate arrangements.
2,A Home Run for Clay,"When I first heard the CD I was surprised because it was not what I expected. As I listened to the songs I realized it was great stuff---a different style of music that shows he can do anything. As I read the other reviews I'm surprised at how many people, like me, were searching for music whose lyrics could be understood and which had meaning. For too long Pop Music has been filled with profanity and violence. As for ""teenie boppers"" and ""Grannies""----Clay's fan numbers speak for themselves---We have the power now. Go Clay!!!!!!!!"
1,LEAKS!!!!,"These diapers are horrible! I've had 3 in the last 2 days leak. I should have just gone with Swaddlers. The sad thing is I have 246 diapers to use, with the potential of them leaking again! They also have a horrible smell. It's supposed to smell clean or fresh, but it just doesn't. It's too strong. The smell I can get over, but the leaking I cannot. You can see where it will leak since the blue lining with all the absorbency doesn't even go all the way to the edge."
2,A Tree Grows,The audio CD of a Tree Grows in Brooklyn was wonderful. I listened to it in the car and it held my interest all the way through. I highly recommend it!
2,This is how textbooks should be written!,"Of the 5 books I own that explain Seismic Refraction principles, Professor Burger is the only one who took the time to walk you thru step-by-step on interpreting a Seismogram. That is the sign of a true teacher and an Author who's not afraid of a little extra effort to help his students practically apply the knowlege. I only wish I lived closer to attend his classes!I do agree with the others in that an IBM PC version of the diskettes is long overdue, but this book still gets my 5 star rating!"
1,Definitely a FAKE,"This is NOT a real Motorola product, the M logo which is supposed to be illuminated from behind is not, there is a little blue LED below the logo - not even close to the real thing. Naturally I am leary of using this to charge my new MOTORIZR Z6tv (Verizon) as I don't want to toast my battery - I tried it on my old Razor phone as a guiny pig and it seemed to work (no smoke came out of it) but i won't use it on my new phone unless I have some kind of emergency and have to. Bottom line (as always) ***YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR***"
2,Fans want more seasons of Strong Medicine,This was a really great show. I hope they hurry up and release more seasons. They got better with every season and the final episode was awesome. I want to own the entire collection!!! Please release them soon.
1,This book is a rip-off. Very disappointing,"I really was dissapointed with this book.I thought I'd learn some ""insider secrets"" as Corey Rudl says in the title, but it only deals with general knowledge! This book is a compilation of some useless ""free reports"" that you can find anywhere on the internet...for free.Eric"
2,rated comparatively with Wilbur's others,"i have read all of Wilbur's books and found that one learns a lot about Africa (with a few exceptions). you learn african history, economics, social problems, environmental problems, natural history, etc. in this one, you learn about the diamond industry and the history of the Namibian diamond coasts, while Wilbur weaves it into his ""unputdownable"" story. kind of like the Master of the Game with substance. for an even better look at Namibian history, try the Burning Shore."
2,delicious,"Great taste --- great snack.For the price I couldn't beat it. Onlyproblem, trying to eat in moderationwhen watching a movie!"
1,True stem-winder of a novel,"Really, really awful. The sheer paucity of Alan Dean Foster's imagination is staggering. ""Midworld"" was recommended to me by a friend; at first I thought I was the victim of a bad joke. Could be used as a blueprint on how not to write a novel. Witless, humorless, and lacking in even the slightest glimmer of originality. Don't waste your time."
2,A very memorable film,"How many films-made-for-TV do you remember being so compelling that scenes from it flash through your head 18 years later? This is such a film.I remember the broadcast, and the constant reminders at commercial breaks that ""this is only a movie."" And well they needed to issue such a warning: the style of a newscast with breaking info and live feeds from remote locations was as real as fiction got.The situation is plausible, the acting convincing, and the ending compelling. The obvious moral and its warning do not reduce the impact of the film or its ending.Highly recommended."
1,waste of money,"Fast deleivery as usual from Amazon, but don't waste your money. This coffee warmer doesn't keep coffee more thann lukewarm at best. Spend more on the Norpro and you'll be very satisfied. I gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it less."
2,The best film nobody saw,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a masterpiece, the most underrated American film of the past 30 years. Poetic, haunting, subtle, and terribly sad, it says more about the crushing impact of repressive (i.e. communist) regimes than a thousand documanteries or inflammatory speeches could tell. While idealizing the free-wheeling Prague of the late 60's the film also examines the emptiness of such a non-commital lifestyle- the unbearable lightness. If this all sounds very somber, ULOB is also one of the sexiest films you will ever see, and one of the few intelligent studies of sex in cinema. More surprisingly, it is a heartbreaking romance. Like a great novel, ULOB grows on you, and you'll hate to see the characters leave you at the end. Perfectly acted by its then unknown leads, and beautifully photographed, this is a film to grow old with."
2,Works great,I added this to my windows vista desktop. It seems to work fine. I have been using it for months.
2,A hilarious roller-coaster ride thru a mixed up life!,"I loved its candid, campy humor, madcap adventures, and sixties rebelliousness. Very stimulating reading! Fun!! Holly's adventures are priceless. It was great fun living the journey... Brian"
1,The Greatest Generation did not get the Greatest Author,"The Greatest Generation they might well have been. The stories are compelling and diverse, However, Mr Brokaw's writing style is an abomination, His prose is dry. He does not trust the reader to be able to draw the significance or irony of the events descibed, rather he is compelled to tell the reader: ""This is significant. This is ironic."" He holds the readers hand rather than setting them free to think about the lives and to appreciate their beauty. I think only bright pink highlighting of the sentences would have been more annoying. All and all, a great topic, great lives but an overbearing and boring presentation. Apparently, Mr. Brokaw is not content to be a reporter but feels it is necessary to be remedial reading instructor as well"
1,TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA,TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEACANNOT GET IT TO THE KINDLE UNIT. IT IS IN PC KINDLE FILE BUT IT WILL NOT PRESENT ON TH KINDLE. THEREFORE IT WASTES MY TIME.
2,Timeless Classic,"I used this book 20+ years ago in a college statistics course and have kept it on my shelf since. The content is as relevant now as then and I just purchased ten copies to share with a number of my colleagues. If you are looking for a sometimes-cheeky, but always-interesting, view of how to make the facts fit the story, this is your book!"
1,Awful,"I bought this book for a friend going through a divorce, luckily I read it first. In a section about a father not being involved with his children they accuse the mother of not making him feel welcome, in a section about court they advise women not to wear short shirts or make-up and it only gets worse. This book was written to convince women to stay married so they don't loss their children."
1,Under Pressure and little else,"If you're just getting into Queen's music, then I would avoid this album if I were you. There's a good reason Queen's popularity went down the tubes in the US, and it's called Hot Space. Hard to believe this album followed the smash hit The Game and preceded The Works, another strong album. But it did, proving that even the great rock bands slip up now and then.The best song on Hot Space is by far Under Pressure, the collaboration with David Bowie. That's the only reason this album gets 2 stars in my rating. Staying Power isn't that great, but not terrible. Body Language is awful; just a hard song to listen to. The other songs are just as bad.If you really want a Queen CD with Under Pressure on it, buy Classic Queen or one of the box sets. Avoid this album. You'll be glad you did."
2,Post,"A challenging record that's worth the effort. ""Army of Me"" and ""Isobel"" are favorites and the big band arrangements and trademark mysterious weirdness make it stylistically diverse."
2,Pampers diapers,"I had been buying Huggies diapers until I ordered size 3, which when opened were the same as size 2. I switched to Pampers and the sizing has been consistant.They are also a better fit for a chubby baby and do not leak."
2,another oldie but goodie,First I love John Wayne movies. I remember seeing this one when I was younger and wanted it. I really like the movies where you knew the Stars (not just actors/actresses who are here today for a couple movies and who knows them after that). I also love the movies of the 40s-early 60's as they told stories that you could also use your imagination on. That is not telling/showing me every detail that belongs in the bathroom and bedroom using vulgar language as well.
1,This is a cult book...,"... but that didn't prevent me from intensely disliking it. The characters are flat, the story is contrived, and why are all people of power in this world men? Very realistic idea of the future."
1,The absolute worst....,"I have never been so disappointed with a book. This one had some real potential, it actually kept me interested (not engrossed) through the first half. That's when things started going down hill - and fast.This one went straight into the garbage when I finished it!"
2,THIS BOOK IS DREAMY!!,"Exploring the unknown has always been a facination with me. I love books about Angels, Life after death, Dream interpretation. This book is facinating. I would also like to recommend a book. It's called I Talked To God And He Wants To Talk To You. It deals with God, Heaven, death, things like that."
1,Cute but painful,"Ugh. I was so excited to get these shoes, but they kill my feet! The band across the top is too tight, and the heels are too loose and rigid. Thre is a definite sizing problem. After one day of wearing them I had raw skin on the top of my foot and my ankles. So painful I went out and bought a different brand of shoes to replace them the next day. Super disappointing!"
1,Bombastic over-indulgent arrogant rock star cliches,"There have been many comparisons of Oasis to the Beatles, often by the band itself; but Noel Gallagher cannot draw the distinction between inspiration and imitation. On their first two albums, they got away with mere imitation just because they came up with some pretty infectious melodies. But on this album, the melodies aren't even there. They've fallen victim to their own hype and have created a monster. For God's sake, do not buy this album. ""All Around the World"" is the best song, although like the rest of the album, someone should have turned off the studio tape halfway through the band's performance. Way too long and tedious. And if Noel is one of the richest musicians in England, can't he afford some cleaner production?"
1,Pampers vs Huggies,"With 3 grandchildren, I've tried many disposable diapers and my daughter and I feel that Pampers does not, in our opinion, measure up to Huggies."
2,Outstanding book,"This is an outstanding book, documenting the quickly-decreasing generation of those who lived through WWII."
2,"Get it, your digital camera will love you for it!","I purchased a brand new Fuji FinePix A201 and wanted to take more pictures with it... came with a small Smartmedia card. So I decided to upgrade and get the Simpletech 128MB SM card. Now I can take a bunch of pictures without changing SM cards so often. Oh yeah, get the Simpletech Smartmedia Flashlink reader, it will get your images from your camera to the PC fast!!"
1,Could Be Better,"I think the plot of this movie was the difference between being loving and being selfish in an unberable and confusing situation. The plot and Christian perspective was a bit limited and could have been further developed. There were a few special effects that occured with more frequency as the movie progressed. These were better than I expected, but could have been better. The whole movie seemed a bit amateurish but I appreciated the Christian perspective it portrayed."
1,Amazon Affiliate,"I wanted to know whether my affiliate link, and commission link worked.It didn't!The book is written in period language, hence I am still in the introductory phase.It is in very small type, which further delays progress."
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed in the CD because I am a fan of the trio and this one had too much input from other musicians. I guess I was looking for unadulterated Steve Newcomb (sp). My error.
2,AWESOME CD!! :),"Clay Aiken has got to be the BEST singer in the world! I LOVE this dude! His first CD, 'Measure of a Man', was absolutely AWESOME!! It includes hit songs such as 'Ivisible', 'The Way', 'When You Say You Love Me', 'No More Sad Songs', and 'Measure of a Man'. Not only are all the songs on the CD an awesome showcase and display of his voice, but they are all appropriate; no cussing or inappropriate references. I'm so proud that of him for being clean and staying true to his values. Kudos for Clay! Go out and buy this CD today! You will not regret it! :)"
1,Not for the faint of heart.,"This was very gory. I got it for my husband, as he is an avid snowmobile rider. After watching part of this... I don't know if I'll ever let him go to the mountains with his buddies, without supervision, anymore.... LOL"
2,Earth-Shattering,"When I first started reading this book, I realized it was just another quirky scifi book, that would end up with somebody killing somebody, and that would be the end. But as I neared the end of the book, something struck me. This COULD be OUR future...if we didn't DO something. This book completely changed my opinion about the contrast between literature and entertainment, censorship, and society in general."
2,It was a great story of a poor girls life.It was facinating!,A girl born in to a poor family shares her life with us by telling her story. She grows to cope with poor ness and lives her life well she loves to attend school and eventualy finds happieness in life.
2,"Keeps 'em dry, as promised.","I'm a mother of 4 children under the age of four, 3 of whom are in diapers. I talk to a lot of moms, and for some, Huggies is the brand of choice, but for my kids, I always have relied on Pampers. Every time my kids wear another brand, those diapers prove to be unreliable (and somewhat disasterous). Pampers have always worked on my skinny-bummed children, all of whom are tall and not ""built like bricks"" or on the chunky side. I highly recommend these diapers."
1,Doesn't measure up,"Ok, before you click on the button that says my review was not helpful, hear me out. I like Clay. I was rooting for him every single week on American Idol. And this CD really isn't that bad. But it isn't that good either. I can be a Clay fanatic and say it's wonderful and perfect but technically there's really nothing there. Every song sounds exactly the same. As I listened to the album I grew extremely bored because I felt like I was listening to one very looooooooong song. Clay is great when you listen to him in doses but song after song of the same melodies with his detached and emotionless voice just gets dull. And I hate what they did to his voice in most of the songs. You can easily tell they ran his vocals through a computer. He has a great voice. They should leave it alone. Maybe in the future when he has more control over his career, if he has a career, he can do things his way.The weakest song on the album is ""Measure of a Man."" That's pure dribble."
1,Weird Science,"Don't support this huckster by buying his book. Read some of the reviews of his anti-aging book or talk to a nutritionist or a scientist at the UCLA School of Public Health. The REAL nutritionists (with REAL credentials) will tell you he is a quack.""Milk is pus from a cow"" according to Null. This is the lowest form of proselytizing -- trying to sell an idea by appealing to a ""disgust factor."" Milk is a good and essential food for those who are not allergic or intolerant. His nutrition advice is damaging; teenagers, the elderly, and those with chronic illness could develop protein, iron, and calcium deficiencies following his program.Also note this: he is secretive about the field in which he has a PhD. Could it be in business?"
2,Nietzsche's Corps/e,"I used to think that Nietzsche was a dangerous thinker. Geoff Waite, by cutting straight to the core of Nietzsche's intentions (with no 'messing around' involved), blows the whole thing apart with a nuclear bomb.There really is nothing more to say... this book is terrible (in an awesome way).I haven't seen or looked at the world in the same way ever sinse I read it.I'd love to see what would happen in the world if this book was more widely appreciated.However, there is one thing that I do know: the struggle continues.Nietzsche isn't dead? - He needs to die!"
1,Poorly Made,"I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes, until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped. Go figure with the poorly made stitching. I've never had a pear of shoes last only one day. I can't believe I wasted my money on this. I've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these. 365 times longer than these shoes. WTF"
2,An extremely good picture book.,The photos of the book are breathtaking and the book gives a good overview of Celtic art spanning the Celtic period. However the reader should bear in mind that the book is not comprehensive. Books available in German such as the Praehistorische Bronzefunde series give one a glimpse as to how wildly creative the Celts were especially in all of the art in general of Hallstatt period and of the variety of of styles found on fibula in the La Tene period. I highly recommend one with a serious interest in Celtic art to continue to search for more source material in addition to this book. However if one were to own one book as an overview of Celtic art I would recommend this book as one of the books to have.
1,"As the kids in school say today ""Boring.""","The beginning and ending narrative touched my heart being from the great state of South Dakota and having walked many small cemeteries where veterans flags and tombstones mark the sites of our fallen. Other than that the stories were shallow and uninteresting, lacking depth and insight of the effect of the war on these individuals. Let's face it, post war prosperity brought these veterans the success they enjoy today. I don't think it had much to do with their military experiences. Joe Foss was not revered by South Dakotans to any extent and throwing Al Neuharth in was really clutching at straws.Really it was the parents of these WWII veterans that were the sacrificers, the moralists, the conservers, the workers, the survivors that should get the credit."
2,PERFECT!!,I absolutely love this series and I am so excited to have it! It's great to be able to watch all your favorite episodes... and even the ones you missed :O . It is a wonderful addition to my collection and I can't wait for future seasons.
2,What do you expect from having friends? Read this book!,"I read this book both in english and in my language version. I've been moved by the truth behind this tragical story. I hate George. He thought he owns his friend's life, the friend who would never hurt him nothing for god's sake. If it turned out that he remained his whole life working in the ranch and spent his fifty bucks a month in whore house, it was because he did it for himself."
1,Dry and Humorless,"I totally disagree with the reviewer from Hongkong who must have been writing about some other book when she portrayed Infatuation as funny and sexy, with witty dialogues and hot passion. As it happens, most of the book is devoted to a character analysis of Judith. In a nut shell, Judith knows that she is an ugly duckling with incredible brain power. We don't see any real attraction developing between Luke and Judith until the last quarter of the book. And then when it does, the author's analysis of Judith is vindicated for she is accepted by Luke because of her brainy self rather than her looks. The most tragicomedical line of the book must be when Luke agrees with Judith that she is not beautiful. Disappointingly for me, just when I'm getting interested in the story in the last quarter of the book, the plot reaches its climax and comes to an end. The story is dry and tends to drag on. I must say that the writing is good as can be expected from Charlotte Lamb. I gave it two stars."
2,To Infinity and beyond!!!,"This is a good lil machine for the price :) I got it for me (especially), but my boyfriend loves to use it on me too. Those little bunny ears work Freakin wonders!!!I never climaxed so quickly.I don't really care for the rotating beads as much as the vibrating bunny ears.When you combine them..boy watch out ;) I would buy this again if I had to.This is my favorite toy so far."
1,Whoops! Product description does not mention it is incomplete,"I love this novel and ordered it for my mom. The price was high enough [exorbitant] for a paperbound book that I thought that the novel would be complete. The product description says NOTHING about it being one volume of a complex work. It is one volume, not the complete work, I was embarrassed to discover from my mom. Where is the rest of the work? NOT AVAILABLE? Available for an additional [exorbitant] sum? If it had been an order for myself, I would return, but my mom is 3,000 miles away and I do not want to add insult to injury by asking her to pack and return ship, so injustice has been rewarded."
2,Another gem in my collection,"This album was quirky enough for me to pick up and love to listen to!How would I compare this....hmmmm....I would probably say she is more like Tracy Bonham than anything. But PowerPop? I wouldn't go that far. She is NOT Aqua (or is that quirky powerpop?) or the spice girls.This is rather laid back kind of music, good stuff. It's the kind of stuff you'd listen to in a coffee shop. Good music, and a wonderful singer. The guitars are very good in this album as well, and I am looking forward to another release.My favorite tracks on this album have to be ""You Are the One"", ""People In This World"" and ""Big Three Wheeler"". ""People in this World"" has to be one of the heavier songs, along with ""Flyer"".If you like Tracy Bonham....(if you even know who she is, she did that amazing song, ""Behind Every Good Woman""), you'll probably like this album as well."
2,One of the best Horror Movies,I absolutely love this movie. From beginning to end you can't look away. It starts off sweet and as it moves along it gets creepier and scarier. Poor Rosemary. Definetely a must see for horror movie fans.
1,SEE 8 1/2 WOMEN INSTEAD,Imagine getting snowbound in a cabin with 8 WOMEN (Universal) and a dead body and then have to witness each woman sing and dance (badly) as they tell their story. Who dunnit? Who cares! A whopping French dud. See 8 1/2 women instead.
1,I didn't think it was that good.,Got this product and used it but it doesn't get me to the big O. It's just to stiff for me and also the rabbit ears don't reach the right place. All i have to say it's just wasn't for me. I wish i didn't buy it.
2,good fidelity; could use a preamp,"AudioSource AMP-100 Stereo Power AmplifierThis amp powers a pair of medium two-way speakers for my home theater. Very good sound for the money. As others have noted, the line inputs are not terribly sensitive, and my Blue-ray player's line outs put out barely enough; I crank the amp's volume control almost all the way up with most movies. No one has complained of insufficient volume. (Someone wrote that there is a line-in sensitivity adjustment or a max gain adjustment or the like, but I cannot find it.) A preamp with a 3- or 4-volt line out would solve this problem and add needed spectrum control, but at greatly increased cost. You can power either of two pairs of speaker connections but not both; the spec sheet is a little vague on this point. I wouldn't upgrade from this amp before spending at least $2000 on speakers."
2,Makes me look like a i have a perfect hourglass figure,"I love how this product makes me look in my clothes!!! its shapes me into a perfect hourglass! i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long. my only complaints are that it is a little too short, so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me, but overall, it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased. i love it and would recommend it to anyone."
2,The BEST Book I've ever written -- JOHN JB WILSON.,"I hope you have as much fun reading this humorous collection of film cliche's as I had writing it and collecting the movie stills which illustrate it. I know I wrote it, but I still laugh out loud at my favorite entries every time I pick it up. WHY NOT PICK UP A COPY YOURSELF"
2,Measure of a Man,"CLay Aiken is the best - his CD is fabulous and he is so much better than Ruben Stoddard. He is a genuine American Idol,handsome, cute, loves God, wholesome, and a really nice person. I only hope he stays #1 forever."
1,"They sound OK, but won't last long","I'm on my 2nd pair, and it just broke like the first pair. They sound OK, and the battery life is OK, but you are paying for a fluff. They do break (usually after any warranty). I for one am not going to buy a 3rd pair, but maybe in about 2 months I'll get these back from repair."
1,BUYER BEWARE! Serious paper feed defect.,"I bought this printer on a whim after having been a satisfied Canon user for a decade. I learned my lesson and will never buy another HP product. This printer worked well for about one month of light use. After this, it began to have problems picking up paper. I have used only HP Bright Inkjet paper, and the paper is crisp and fresh, so it's not a problem with humidity or curled paper. It's reached a point where every sheet of paper has to be individually coaxed into the feed mechanism. Even then, it jams about half the time.It's hard to believe that HP did not discover this problem during product development and testing. Yet they have put this piece of junk on the market. I'm having to write mine off as a loss because it's now too late to return it to the store, and HP's only solution is to replace it with the exact same printer with the same problem. I'm hoping someone files a class action suit against HP for the junk they put on the market."
2,Worth your $,"I was hesitant to buy this one, as I thought their first album was just OK, but since I knew they were talented, I rolled the dice. Once it entered my car player, it stayed there for over a week straight. (That can only happen with a great opening track, which this of course has) Great vocals, lyrics, driving rhythm section, even a semi drum solo that is mixed in a cool stereo manner. I dig this album, hope you do too."
2,STILL THE BEST,I have reviewed this album before and have not changed my mind at all - it is absolutely the best music out there. Clay has everything going for him. Eclectic - I and 8 other members of my family will join you in Glendale.
1,Four year old purrs while I hiss.,"This is a very attractive game. Cool cover art. Neat purple wooden mice and two fun dice with a sleeping cats, dinner bowls, and left pointing arrows. You basically take turns rolling these dice and either: doing nothing, giving a mouse to the player on your left, taking a mouse from the dinner bowl, or putting a mouse in the dinner bowl.That's all there is to it. There is no strategy whatsoever and no where to grow once you master the mechanics of rolling dice and moving mice. My four-year-old has wanted to play it once since we bought it, but to me it's a very tiring ordeal. I envy the cats sleeping on the dice.This game is good for teaching very young children how to take turns and roll dice, but not a whole lot more. Just think that when you buy a game this simple for young children, you will likely have to play it with them, over and over and over."
2,Funny Movie!!!,I bought this movie for my son and daughter and not only did they love it but I found myself watching and enjoying this movie as well. Very good movie for kids who love sponge bob. I definitely recommend to others.
2,It Worked!,The bottom of my shoe had separated. Had heard about this product from other people. Tried it and the repair worked.
2,for spongebob fanatics...,I like the movie... Spongebob is charlie brown's counterpart who just happens to live in a pineapple under the sea....

1,Dont order them in white or any light color,We have owed these plates in white for quite some years. maybe six or more. I just replaced all of them with a set from Crate and Barrell. They are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways. First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark. Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them. After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them. They also seemed to chip very easily. So between the chips and marks all over them I couldn't take looking at them anymore. They also are not good in the microwave. They get very hot and the food not so much. I would not recommend for everyday use. Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable. My advice is to purchase bone china or porcelain. I will never buy these again.
1,DANGEROUS,"This stick is extremely dangerous. I tried it to remove a small wart from the top of my foot, and it created a major chemical burn on the skin surrounding the wart. It is incredibly painful and now I'll probably need to have the wart surgically removed, which I was trying to avoid. I'd rate it NO stars if I could."
1,Fahrenheit 451 Audiobook,Some Authors should NOT read their books for the audio format. This is by far the worst I have heard. I found it extremely difficult to follow the story which sounded like it was being read by my great grandfather!
1,About as scary as The Simpsons!,"I saw this movie at the cinema and thought it was ok, so I bought it on DVD and found out i could only enjoy it the first time i had seen it. It was boring and the only good bit is the Special Effects ending. I would only recommend this as a rental!"
1,SUCKS,this movie was the longest...boring movie i have ever seen. i didn't think he could ever do a horrible movie till this one. the whole movie shows him getting high and going on trips and setting people up for his mistakes...its a bunch of crap! maybe it would be good for someone that is really stoned out of their mind to sit down in watch.
1,It sucked go see War of the Worlds instead.,A lot of people told me that Batman Begins was good but I didn't like it. The first hour was too long and slow without Batman and it was all about Bruce Wayne training to becoming Batman and Batman did not show till the last hour. I'm not really a big fan of Liam Neeson though he's boring but what's really the point of this Batman movie there's nothing exciting about it. It really wasn't surprising to me. Christian Bale did make an excellent Batman and his voice really fitted as Batman but the whole movie was just not good. Wait for the DVD don't see it in theater. That's all I have to say. I thought War of the Worlds was better than Batman. Batman Begins really sucked.
1,Seemed like a good concept...,"First off, let me say that I have been braiding hair for two decades and although I am not a licensed professional, I think I would definitely qualify as an experienced braid technician, or whatever you wish to call it. I bought this product because I thought, ""Wow! This is pretty cool! It might spare the tips of my fingers from being burned"". Well, I was wrong. It doesn't ""cut"" the braid as described. It burns off the bottom portion and creates a finished look that is quite tacky considering that you have to clamp down on the braid longer than you might expect just to ""cut"" it. I ended up using my lighter. Whoever designed this should get back to the drawing board. Do not buy this product unless you want the end of your braids to look like a big flat piece of melted plastic. To give this item one star is giving it way too much credit."
2,"Great book, in a great size!!","I love Jules Verne's writing. This book is small enough to fit in a purse or glove box so you can take it with you anywhere. If you like steampunk fiction, or old west, read some Jules Verne"
1,nothing relevant,"It is a so-called ""how to win"" guide that has nothing scientific. The book is simplistic and focused on prediction. No mathematical approach.Reading any lottery book with the word ""win"" in its title is a waste. For realizing this, you must first get in touch with the essence of lottery. For doing this, get a book on mathematics of lottery.You better use the money to buy more tickets instead of this book."
1,This one's a loser,"Maggie Shayne can certainly write, but this one is a loser. It was difficult to warm up to the hero and heroine - Edie, a former lingerie model is cold and colorless, she returns to her home town and buys up the property that Wade has always wanted because he ticked her off. This is neither adult nor endearing. He, on the other hand, is your typical alpha male who, in this case 'jerks' off while looking at her layouts in lingerie. Not an attractive trait either. These two people are just not likeable and Edie is so dumb, it's scarey - while she's being stalked, she buys an isolated piece of property. The scene where her sister is being tortured is far too explicit for a category romance and more appropriate to a mainstream thriller. The rest of Edie's family were far more interesting than the main characters. Overall, disappointing and not nice."
2,Great books on fly fishing,"I have read many authors on the subject of fly fishing. Dave Hughes is a great writer. He puts it in a language a beginner can understand. I am not a beginner but I really like to read his books. I had several of his books and gave them to our new county library. Then I missed them, so I went on amazon and re-bought several of them. Great service! Would do it again. Tight lines."
2,Very nice shirt,"This product is just what I expected, minus the fact that due to being white, you can easily see my nipples through the shirt. I have several other compression fit underarmour heat gear shirts, but they are all more opaque due to being red and blue. The transparency of these white shirts, combined with the dark coloration of my areolae has caused me to have to alter my running form while wearing this shirt, so that I can keep my nipples covered with my hands as I run. Minus one star for shame."
2,good enough diapers for me,"I have no problem with these diapers on my child, however, I wish I had ordered a smaller size because he happened to transition to size 3 shortly after this purchase. Just bad timing. Otherwise, great product!"
1,Beware of packaging,"Sorry I know this is supposed to be a review of the item, but I want my complaint heard by anyone that might buy it. The hat itself is great, if you buy it at the store. New Era hats have large bills and a tall crown, but as long as you don't have a tiny head it will look fine. My complaint was that they shipped me this hat in a dvd box. Seriously. The hat was completely flattened, leaving two huge creases on either side of the logo. Ruined hat if you ask me, and will be returning immediately. You're probably better off buy this item in a hat store and spend the extra few dollars, at least they will have treated it right up to that point."
1,only one star because I can't give it zero!,"This book is full of tabloid lies and speculation. If you really want to know what happened in 93' the book to read is ""Redemption"" by Geraldine Hughes. Raymond your book is garbage and you know it. You and your entire family are money hungry greedy people going after MJ to destroy his legacy. The facts about the 93' case are out there you just need to seek them. Here is a list of reads and visuals to start with:1. ""Was Michael Jackson Framed?"" 1994 GQ article by Mary Fisher2. ""Redemption"" by Geraldine Hughes about 1993 case3. ""Michael Jackson Conspiracy"" by Aphrodite Jones bout the 2005 trial4. ""The Untold story of Neverland"" DVD by Larry Nimmer5. ""The Visual Documentary"" by Adrian GrantIt is really sad that the media controls people the way they want too. Wake up America the media is keeping the ""TRUTH"" from you by not giving you the whole story."
1,Ben Franklin,Boring Boring boring I fell asleep reading this book I'm never reading thisAgain it's plain boring boring i tell you zzzzzzzz
1,Probably for Little Little Kids Only,"Maybe I didn't give the game a chance, but I couldn't because I would get motion sick too quickly. Maybe it's the very bright colors or the high-pitched music or the constantly going around in circles, but I was hanging over the side of my TV, turning green within 15 minutes every time I tried to play this. I was on the Baby Easy level, too, and I didn't find it all that easy, but I'm not a kid. No doubt it's probably a lot of fun later on when you get vehicles and stuff, but I couldn't even put together the snowman in the beginning levels. To its credit, the Baby Easy level does let you win even when your skills are horrible because I was a huge failure as far as navigating a river, and the game still applauded me and advanced me to the next level. (And still I couldn't put together the snowman. I am such a loser.)"
2,The album divine,"This album is the best of Yello's earliest albums. My favourite song is Si Senor The Hairy Grill, but Call It Love is also good as well as Goldrush, Dr Van Steiner, The Rythm Divine and L'Hotel. I havn't quite get used to the other songs (as you often have to do with Yello's songs). Buy this album!"
2,best movie i've seen all year!,Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore make a great couple! the storyline promises greatness but it's even better! After the intial fun of such a subject (drew's character has no short term memory) they get to the meaningful part of the movie and just makes your heart fly it's so great! A must for everyone!!
2,Great,This book is in the vein of 1984 and other great books that show amazing foresight. Words of warning for the present and future.
1,A good yarn,A reasonable read. Good story line although I expected it to be about captain cochrane himself. Worth a look at.
2,great,"I saw this movie ""golden earings"" when I was a kidand I always wanted to see it agan. now I own a copyof it. It was great"
1,One of the worst Mozart #23 by a professional pianist,"A mediocre performance by a professional pianist. By playing the 3rd movement of Mozart #23 without looking the CD label, you would think this could be a pretty good amateur young player performing at a local winning concert. Didn't hear any elegance of Mozart. Sorry for the renowned orchestra."
1,"Where is the ""Truth""","As a St. Louis resident during this crime, I was especially interested in this book. I was very disheartened when I heard Ms. Cummins interviewed on the radio and a police detective called in and challenged her account, claiming that she misquoted him. It appears that Ms. Cummins chose to not interview anyone, just go by court documnets. Needless to say, I am left still wondering what the real truth is, since apparently this is really a work of fiction.I also felt like this was a way to clear her brother's name, as there was very little in this book about the actual victims, who in my mind, are the girls who were raped and murdered. The fact that a family member is trying to ride this tragedy to fame and fortune is beyond obscene, and I can't imagine the pain this is causing the family of the actual victims.If this story needed resurecting, I would have liked to see what the truth really is, not a family member's whitewashed version of things."
2,One of the greatest books ever,"I literally continuously read this book for about nine months. I would finish the book in only a few days, but I absolutely loved it. I just started over and kept reading it and re-reading it. This is one of those books where the plot got better every time and even knowing the ending did not dampen the suspense. I thought this book is one of the greatest of its class ever. Orwell is a true master."
1,Half way thru reading then bang! You may as well be dead.,"I was riveted to this book and really picking up speed until I reached about dead center of the book. Then POW! Ms. Reichs throws ridiculous, implausable coincidences to salvage her complex plot. I was really in there with her until her ridiculous plot links. This a mystery that detectives must dream of. I call it the ""follow the dots"" scheme that result in a staight line honing in on a places the heroine just happens to be even if they are literally a thousand miles apart. Thus I hurled the book into the air, it fell to earth I care not where!"
2,Very Nearly Perfect,"This is one of few films I've seen that has such a perfect combination of acting, script, photography...story. It is intelligent in a way very few films are, and treats the viewer with the respect to draw their own conclusions about this complex moral/ethical/cultural dilemma. Like real life, it shows the four-dimensionality of existence. For me as a Scandinavian-American, every emotional note rang true. Wonderful movie."
1,Not the best in zombies,"I was very excited about reading this book, especially knowing it was a series. The hope to carry characters through a cataclysm is one that intreges me. Unfortunatly, although the concept around the story is a good one, the characters are incredibly unsympathetic. They are either bickering or whining, even close moments when you feel that they are going to connect it turns into a confronation. At the end I really didn't care if they lived or died.And the language is unbelievably harsh, yes, I don't mind the occasional f-bomb, but at times it seemed unrelenting. If you agree with this review and have read the other books and Mr Moody's writing style has changed please let me know."
2,Awesome,"Clay Aiken is going places noone has been in a long, long time. What a talent! What a voice! What a role model to today's youth.... thanks Clay!"
1,The most painful reading and I did finish it.,"My wife loved this book. I belong to a book club at work and they chose this book. I finished it. It was painful. Other members in the club also agreed -- It was extremely tedious, repetitiously annoying and not funny."
2,Its better than the picture,"Its very small and much cooler-looking than in the picture. For some reason the picture makes it look big and geeky, but it is actually really small and slick looking. It works wonderfully was a very strong antenna. The only reason it lost a star was because it was expensive for what it is. Although its a good G adapter, its still G. Not N. For double the regular price I would like to get double the speed. However overall its very good."
1,Kurt deserved more than nothing,"One of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through. Actually I turned it off after about an hour...I don't know why I waited that long. Kurt was such an interesting and enigmatic person, a movie should have been made to pay respect to him or give something of a behind-the-scenes look at him. This movie basically shows Kurt as a wasted heroin addict with nothing more to offer or say or do; lazy film making, terrible camera work. Seriously if you rent this movie after reading this review you have no one to blame but yourself. Literally one of the worst movies ever wasted on film."
1,Driver Support,No Mac support. Boooo Hissss!No Win95 support? GOOD! Why are you still running that outdated OS anyway? At least upgrade to Win98.
1,it's your choice,"Do you always believe what you read. For many, we do. They say, you can't judge a book by its cover, and that is what many people do to the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. To know what they are about, and why you ""fear"" them, you must get to know them. If you feel that this book is true, it may work, or it may not, but pray about it. Mormons aren't bad, no one is. It's only what we say, think and act, that makes people and their religion seem bad. Saying something about other people is a choice that we each have,...""free agency"" and should try to be Christ like in that choice."
1,Bratz babyz are OKAY,A lot of people say that these bratz babyz are sooooooooooo cute but I don't think that they are that cute.My cousin Emily just got Bratz big babyz Cloe and she kept telling me and my sister that it was sooooooooooo cute.I think the baby was okay but it wasn't wonderful and she even asked me where the nose was because it was soooooooooo small.A lot of kids say that they are cute but the bratz babyz don't even have real hair and there eyes are huge. I think a lot of people just like them because they are bratz because if MyScene made the same babies that bratz did a lot of kids wouldn't even buy the MyScene babies.So kids need to stop saying there cute because if MyScene made the same babies kids that hate MyScene would say the babies were ugly.
2,Solid story and plenty of action,"I have to caveat this review by saying that I wasn't familiar with the comic or graphic novels of this character. That said, I really enjoyed the movie and felt that it blended historical and mythological themes regarding heaven and hell well. The beginning when the primary relic that the film focuses on is found was particularly weak, however all of the characters had at least a few good moments with most of them being recognizable without being cliches.Keanu Reeves has more of an edge in playing John Constantine than in most of his previous efforts, but you'll still find yourself waiting for him to call for George Carlin pick him up in his transdimensional telephone booth ala ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"""
2,Full Skip,"perfect fit, and wonder why I haven't had one for so long. non clinging, full coverage and absolutely perfect for light weight comfort."
2,Great Group,This is one dvd that any beach boys fan should have in their dvd collection.And if you ever wonder how such an clean cut band got ever involed in the likes of Charles Manson again this the dvd for you or if you like the beach boys music again get this dvd cause it everything that you want to know.So buy your copy now and enjoy.Rondall Banks
1,Skip It,"The author fills up a great deal of space with musings about her own family and her own life. She makes huge, inaccurate assumptions about all redheads based upon herself, none of which apply to me, also a natural redhead. The author has a decidedly Christian perspective, which, as a Jewish redhead, I found distasteful. I thought this book would reveal some fascinating information about red hair, but it was sorely disappointing. A waste of time, really."
1,A Let Down To much like all of her others,"I was looking forward to reading another great book by Julie Garwood, what I got was a book that had flat characters and didn't make me feel anything the way her other books have. Maybe if I hadn't read her other books and hadn't expected so much of this new one I would have liked the book better. The bottom line is I am sick of all of her heriones getting lost and having no sense of direction. And if one more wrings her hands together I think I'll scream! Miss Garwood needs to start to give her heros and heriones new personalities and stop having them all share the same traits and act alike. The only reason I did not give it one star was because the story was there, but the characters were not."
1,Recycled and Reused,"Measure of a Man should read Measure of a Boy. His ""so-called"" music is only been recycled from previous performers such as N-Sync, Backstreet Boys, etc. Isn't there anyone out there with an original voice or original music that they write themselves? This guy is not even worth watching as I witnessed one night on Jay Leno's, Tonight Show. Give me Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, even Luciano Pavarotti! At least these guys can and did sing with soul and a lot of heart, something this kid should learn before he releases another song. Even my 15 and 17 year old kids just can't get into this guy's singing. Sorry Clay!"
2,Recent Purchase,The book I ordered was exactly as described and delivery was even faster than promised.
2,The book that really works!,"This well-written, conversational and sensible book provides helpful advice for the perimenopausal woman. Addressing each of the major areas affected by menopause (hormonal, cardiovascular, cognitive/emotional, bone health), Ms. Taylor provides sound, referenced explanations and explores intervention options with the reader including evaluations of efficacy and safety. This book is the Honest Herbal of non-pharmaceutical menopause therapies. I whole-heartedly recommend it not only to women approaching/undergoing menopause, but to their families as well. Additionally, it is an excellent resource for health care practitioners working in the area of women's health who would like to offer their patients non-pharmaceutical intervention options."
1,"""HOME MADE"", Lowest Budget Film...","********* W A R N I N G ! ************* STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE! ****This movie is pretty bad! Ultra low budget movie with terrible acting and a boring plot, which combined with a huge stuggle to stay and watch should have given this one a NEGATIVE FIVE STAR RATING!!!MONEY DOWN THE TUBES WITH THIS ONE!!!"
2,b. knight still underrated in my book,"I've always liked brian mcknights music, ever since I heard anytime i was hooked. The man writes and composes his own music, i respect that. Not the typical brian mcknight which is probably why some knight fans have turned away. This is probably knight's most personal album, heance the title ""gemini."" Every song I feel like I'm sitten in a club just zonin out and feelin this R&B vibe. Kind of the feeling you get with Marvin Gaye or Luther Vandross, beautiful music. Usher and these wanna-be R&B legends better stand aside, Mr. Mcknight has entered the building."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I've had this book for over a year and I must say that as time goes by, I am less and less impressed with this book. I have no problem following instructions yet it took me three tries to get some of these recipes to turn out. I never got her sweet nut crust to work. I used the recipe from ""In the Sweet Kitchen"" instead and the crust came out perfect.And some of the recipes are not nearly as imressive as they look. The only recipe that I've made that received any ""wows"" from my guests was the tiramisu tart, and that wasn't until the third time I made it when I made significant changes to the recipe. A few of the recipes were huge disappointments.I would highly recommend ""In the Sweet Kitchen"" or the Cindy Mushet book instead."
2,This book really works,"I started using the ideas in this book 3 months ago, and our home is beginning to feel like the country cottage we've always wanted. I like the pictures. And the writing is telling me how to make lots of big and small changes in every room. Thank you!!!"
1,It ain't The Exorcist...,"Don't bother with Rosemary's Baby. Don't watch it unless you are really bored on a rainy day. The film is so slow-paced and dated; 20 minutes in to the film I was looking at my watch to see how much longer I'd have to suffer. It finally ended and I let out a long sigh of relief! It is SO boring, you'll just go crazy! Please, for the love of goodness see the infinitely superior The Exorcist instead of this turkey any day of the week."
2,I love Molly Gloss!,"I loved ""The Dazzle of Day"" and now I love ""The Jump-Off Creek"". Molly Gloss is a wonderful writer. The images are evocative, the characters ring true, the plot is interesting and engrossing. My only criticism is the frequency with which she describes ""smiles"" (slow, deliberate, flat, purposefully, gently, etc.) -- it got a bit distracting. But that's a small criticism. Molly Gloss: write more, faster!"
1,"Small minded, misogynistic and racist","The plot is that Adam Sandler etting tired of dating (and etcetera-ing) different women every week gets into a permanent relationship with a woman, But through the wonder of script writing, he finds one for whom he can rewrite her memories every day. He is helped by a bumbling and goofy band of Hawaiian natives. As in all his movies Adam Sandler gets to be the hero and to mock almost everyone else (including his girlfriends brother) all in all a terrible movie. Don't waste your time."
1,lame photos and dreary topic,"This book should be called ""white girl culture""... there is hardly an ethnic looking girl in the book! Lots of suburban teen-age girls looking like they are trying to be fit in. Nothing really insightful, new or surprising. Some photos are a bit interesting but most are overly self-conscious from subject and photographer... sorry but these images are easy to forget,(and border on teasing male viewers)... save your money and wait for the video!"
2,An Endearing Tale,I have seen the video twice for this story and did not realize how much was not included until reading the book!This is a timeless classic. It reminded me of Angela's Ashes butwith greater sensitivity.Do not let this one pass you by.
2,How could you say a bad word about it???,I don't understand how anyone can possibly trash this CD. If you ever liked Musiq you should def. love this CD--From the incredible Soulstar intro to the very end of Givemorelove/Leaveamessage. The whole Cd is a standout against all other music in the insdustry. He's def. an original artist.Please don't let these reviewes sway you against buying this CD--listen to the samples yourself and if you dont like it you just don't like music/musiq.
2,Measure of a Man,What a voice this young man has. Can't wait to hear the next one. Except for a couple songs with the instrumental being a bit too loud the CD is perfect. Thank you Mr. Aiken and RCA for wonderful entertainment.
2,"book, book, book","throughout the novel, you are exposed to many different thingS comparing to our world to this books words. the main character Guy is a firemen and his job in this world is to burn books that they find among the people. This book repersents the amount of learning that the people will be doing in the future of our county it tv will keep going as it is. the book is a good book it has the posibility of telling people what we will come to if we stop reading. There are factors that leading to the general lack of interest in reading and factors that make people actively hostile toward books. Nature is presented as a force of innocence and truth with one of the characters.Blood appears throughout the novel as a symbol of a human being's repressed soul or primal, instinctive self. Montag often feels his most revolutionary thoughts welling and circulating in his blood. thsi book kept me interested un till the end because you did not know what crazy thing was goin to go on next."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this item to use with my LG Env. I thought it would have been a lot better since it was a motorla but I was way wrong. EVERY CALL HAS A HOWL!!! I have tried it on 5 different phones including 2 Env's, 1 Env2, 1 voyager and a blackberry. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS."
1,This is awful,"I bought this album because it had some songs off of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus on it but it was a complete dissappointment, it has the really horrible singer that sounds nothing like the original singer, and he completely destroys some of my favorite songs with his awful warbling and squalking."
1,Not Bat Chain Puller,"The original Bat Chain Puller is due to be released by Zappa records on 13th Feb., remastered with 3 bonus tracks from the same line up. THIS IS NOT IT. Dust Sucker is a poor quality, badly mastered version, with 6 bonus tracks from different line ups. It appears that Dust Sucker is being re released on the same date as The Original Bat chain Puller is coming out, in the hope of getting some sales of the back of it in the confusion. Don't buy Dust Sucker, buy Original Bat Chain Puller on Zappa records. Not Currently available on Amazon but available on pre order at [...]"
1,"Not accurate, needle gets stuck","Maybe it's just the hot summer temperatures where we live (in Texas), but this thermometer turned out to be pretty useless - when the day got hot and the needle went up above 90 degrees, it would get stuck there and would not go down when the temperature went down. Plus when the thermometer arrived, it didn't tell the accurate temperature - the directions say you have to set it to the correct temperature by turning a screw at the back, which we did, but then after that it would get stuck as described above. Very disappointing product."
2,A Very Important Novel,"One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read ( and I have read thousands).Marquez is a giant. His skill is like that of a mythical creature, like a Phoenix combined with a hundred great authors.The pure fact that this book was written by one man is amazing. I don't want to say anything about the story. If you care about great literature, do not let life pass by without reading Marquez' masterpiece."
2,"Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggity dog!","This little guy is awesome! Bought it for my daughters 3rd birthday party. She loves it, and I know the kids will get a kick out of it. For the price it is a great buy. Not for commercial or high volume use, but perfect conversation piece at small parties or soirees ."
2,This is a must see for anyone who likes haunted houses.,"This is one movie I would watch over and over again. The story is great. the suspense is great without alot of blood and guts. As it says in the movie"" makes a great bedtime story""."
2,"does what it says, and does it well.","I wear large shoes, mens size 14 U.S.A. so I have to use every other spot, but it still works great! before I got this shoes littered my room because I ran out of slots under my bed. I didnt want to get rid of shoes because I color coordinate (fashionable, [...]). If I had more room, i woulld order a second one of these bad boys to sit next to the other one. too bad i dont =("
2,Satisfied customer,The Bones 8095 is a credible rack. There are no adjustment settings or application charts to tell you how to install the rack. The car fit charts are minimal. It held a girls mountain bike tightly on four 250 mile highway trips with my 2001 Honda Accord 4 door. The mounting clips work very well although the straps seem thin. The cam buckles work very well.
1,i need help,"i bought the sts13-s venturer and it will not play my cds, nor dvds the cd loads put does not play, it freezes the disc doesn't spin at all, i cannot get anything on my tv at all, is there anyone that can help me out here, could it be the head on it, i hope not it is fresh out of the box. please if someone can help iwould really appreciate it.thankspat"
1,Not good,"Well, I only write reviews for things I dont like enough. Otherwise dont bother.I previously had a sansa and it worked great. I dropped and broke it. The best thing about sansa is Rhapsody on the go feature and the radio feature. Unlike say an iPod, I can just listen to all kinds of music for $14.99 or something.But this new one keeps giving me the wror message 'Your tracks are not synchronized'. I then have to deauthorize device and computer, re-authorize, re-format, restore factory settings, to get it to work. Mega pain in the behind.Dont know if the fault is with Rhapsody or with Sansa, but I am seriously looking for other options for my music."
2,Great Suspense! A Classic Short Story!,"Great Book! Keeps you focused and entertained. Classic ending, Climax of the story is thrilling, hits you when you least expected it..Great Plot, Great Character descriptions, you feel in touch with the characters and feel their every emotion! A Must Read! I couldn't stop reading...You TOO will enjoy it!"
2,I love this bed! carry it anywhere!,"I was little apprehensive before buying an airbed thinking how it would be. But this turned out real nice one. It doesn't need you to call U-haul when you move out. It doesn't require much space to carry it with you anywhere you go. Its also really easy to inflate with the electronic pump and even easier to deflate naturally. After you get used to the ""airbed"", it feels like a normal bed. It offers a great option for people who don't want a hassle of carrying mattress and other accessories along with the trouble of carrying them.It also doesn't require you to carry your pillow. The top surface is velvet like thing that is so soft, you could do w/o a bed sheet also.go for it, if you need one."
1,Cannot be used with Playtex Nurser Bottles,I was very disappointed to get this product and find out that it cannot be used with Playtex Nurser bottles.
1,A little disappointing,"I wasn't too happy when I got this book in the mail. It simply does not have very much material, even for a baby. All my granddaughters teach their children simple signing starting at a few months and pre-verbal signing is great for eliminating much of the frustration of not being able to express themselves, but it seems to me that the pictures in this book would be difficult for them to catch on to. Obviously, the adult would need to teach the signs but I don't think they would be able to recognize them from the pictures after they learned them."
1,Beware - Not Same As Pictured/Described,"When purchasing this from Amazon Prime (not a third-party seller), the item that you will receive is not the Mega Playland, but rather the Megaland model. It has three compartments and two tunnels but is a a much different configuration. It can only be configured in an ""L"", not a straight line like the pictured Mega Playland model."
2,nice,This is a good app that works well with the system and we have had no problems with this app so far.
1,terrible!,These people cannot sing on key or write a melody that sounds like more than cacauphony! Terrible! I couldn't stand to listen to it.
1,Should characters have brains?,"When I first started to read this book, I recognized right away a lot of potential in the story. All of the scary elements that I was hoping for were there, and the pace drew me in immediately. But as the book went on I became annoyed at first, and gradually frustrated with the character's complete lack of brains.As bad things start to go down, the characters seem to want to do everything except for the obvious - leave. There is nothing that really forces anyone in this story to stay where they are at, and as the death toll mounts and creepy goings on get more sinister, it never seems to cross any ones mind that the simplest solution would be to find a nicer neighborhood. It is like there is a Masterton IQ Reduction Chip (tm) lodged inside each character's head!And as silly as that sounds, had the author used a gimmick like this to explain the stupidity of his characters, I probably could have enjoyed the narrative enough to have given it 3.5-4 stars instead of 1."
1,WHY ?,"Do computer generated things scare you? They don't scare me.Do sets scare you? They don't scare me either.I understand that studios can't make money re-releasing old classics in theatres because of home video but why spend all that money trying to remake or even surpass something that is obviously the sum of its human parts, all of whom you won't or can't reuse?Isn't that like trying to be the first man on the moon - - - -again?Some scriptwriters and directors could make a biscuit and a glass of milk frightening.They used a super computer called talent.Please reboot."
1,You don't want this version!,"When I first put this DVD in I noticed that they cut away the opening, then the movie starts and I can't believe my eyes as the quality of the DVD is even lower than my VCD version, this is just frustrating to watch. The subtitle cannot be change or removed since it is fixed onto the movie, the subtitle is in chinese and english use at the same time, the quality of the image is so below par that the subtitle at times can't even be read. Another thing is the audio, you can't switch between Cantonese and Mandarin like on my VCD, yes this too was fixed to cantonese only. There is no extra features, you might as well buy a VHS tape, which would probably be an improvement on the picture quality. It does look like they tranfer this movie from an overused VHS tape with no other intention then to sell it to unsuspecting ""customers""(read victims)."
1,Big Brother is Watching!,"George Orwell's book 1984 is a wonderful book set in England's future if WW II never stopped. The main character in the book, Winston, is an ordinary worker at a regular office in England. The catch is he can remember the past some what. In England's future it is ruled by an all knowing man named Big Brother of BB in new speak (the language of oceania earlier called England).Once Winston realizes this chick named Julia likes him he and she start secretively dating which is against the rules of the party. Winston finally realizes what is going on with society and BB. Winston and his girlfriend finally get the nerve and take a chance and join the resistance against the party. In the end it doesn't turn out how he expects it to be but was inevitable.The book was a great read and a good use of time. I personally think big brother is the man. Even though it was a school assignment to read it was great."
2,Big Brother is Watching Yo' Ass,"WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. I am unable to adequately describe to you here how utterly amazing (also horrifying, nightmarish, grim, cold, and bleak) this book is. If you feel that you're capable of transcending to a new level of intellectual awareness and intelligence, then you're ready for this book. People who read this book that aren't ready for this transition will find the experience unfulfilling."
2,Great trilogy,The dark knife trilogy is by far one of the best trilogy's ever! With great action and suspense these are must watch movies!
2,Jeep clutch slave cylinder,Answer the same as the Master cylinder. Nothing available from Jeep. Seems to perform as expected. Delighted as the only other answer would have been to change complete clutch setup including bell housing.
1,Cold Space,"I saw the tour of this ""album"" as a GI stationed at Lindsey AS Germany in 1982. They played two songs from this CD; first they played ""Under Pressure"" which the crowd went nuts for. Then they played ""Body Language"" and I swear the crowd went stone quiet. Needless to say, the band didn't play another song from this album. I only give this review two stars because ""Under Pressure"" is when of the best songs they have ever written. Other then that, like my German friends in 1982, I find this to be awful. The worst in their glorious career."
2,Handy lil mp3 player,"I bought the 512mb for my daughter. It's big enough (drive wise) for her favorite songs and small enough (compact wise)she can take it with her instead of a portable cd player when we travel. The sound is pretty good and transfer is easy, though a little slower then the other mp3 players that we have."
2,Amazing,Janice's book and video have worked wonders for me. I no longer get a stiff neck when I work on the computer. I sleep better than ever before..... Great resource!
2,Great Easy Listening Tunes,"This Reunion of two superstars is long overdue in CD form. Every one of the 24 songs is enjoyable. My own favorite is The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. I'm not a big country music fan, but this album should appeal to a wide range of listeners. I've been a Jimmy Webb fan since his work with the 5th Dimension and Richard Harris. His writing is the best, and Glen Campbell's voice has never sounded better. I ordered the CD based on the pre-release mention on the VH-1 special on Glen Campbell and have played it daily since it arrived. It's a real pleasure to hear this great work."
1,If you're burdened to having to connect to a CISCO WLAN,"this may the only way you can do it. My netgear card would connect but couldn't meet all the security imposed on it...had to buy this expen$ive little darling. Worked fine but I really dislike being held captive to one vendor to use a network. But it IS CISCO so why am I surprised? regardless, performs well and is a bargain at half the price."
2,IMHO not for children,"I found the beginning to be interesting, albeit kind of sad. But when it turned to what I guess is an opiate trip, it got downright creepy. Gave me nightmares.I'd heard of it forever and I'm glad I read it. But I would not read it again."
2,Hauntingly relevant,"This was an important book when it was written, and amazingly it is still very relevant today. When it was written, the world was facing the threat of global communism. Wells does an excellent job of attacking the flaws of communism while also focusing on the ways it would be expanded in the future. When you look at the technology we have now, you realize that this book was somewhat prophetic.This book was certainly not a call to action against communism however. It was more the product of frustration and hopelessness, and a warning to the reader. As such, the book is pretty depressing. The characters are trapped in their world and completely unable to change anything about it. Even when it looks like there may be hope, it is soon crushed by Big Brother. I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who is thinking of buying it, so I'll say no more. This is a great read for anyone who needs a reminder of how important and delicate our freedoms are."
2,A Great Place to Start...,This is a must-read for anyone who wants to know where the modern labor laws and labor unions come from. It depicts in stark detail the criminal acts against American working people that do not show up in many textbooks.
1,Awful movie.,"Standard Michael Bay garbage. Totally removed from the original idea, especially concerning Optimus Prime's character. The ideals the character originally stood for are completely ignored in favor of kill shots and 'Murican tough guy crap."
1,"If I could, I'd give her negative stars","There must be an explanation for why Time Warner Cable chose her to do their commercials, but I just don't get it. Her voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard to me. I've seen drunk karaoke singers sing better than her. She is everything that is wrong with the music business today - record companies will promote these no-talent artists in advertising, pay off Clear Channel (who owns 90+% of all radio stations) to spin their records, and true artists are left behind. I bet the hair on Mick Jagger's neck stands up when he thinks of his classic tune being butchered by this nobody in those annoying commercials."
2,an initiation into the world of real estate,"Yes... Ron is right... 'don't expect miracles from a book.' Folks... this isn't a read a few chapters and suddenly be a genius type thing. He gives you examples of ways he has made tons of money in real estate and you shouldn't expect everything to work as planned or for there to be everything you need in this book. You still have to work your market... test stuff out... gain experience... learn the ropes... etc etc. For all the naysayers... I would say read it again and again... buy a few other books too... join some real estate forums... if you really want to succeed in real estate. And about his plugs for his bootcamps/courses... they are very good... but you don't need them... do with what you have and take ACTION.I'm reminded of a saying I heard a while ago ""We will either find a way or make one."" Good Luck"
1,What's with the low sound?,"I bought the Zen Xtra 40Gb yesterday, taking it back today. The sound is awful. The volume range goes up to a 25, and even with the EAX or whatever it's called on, it's barely audible. I don't know if it's the jack gone like you all say or if this is just designed for easy listening. No good for loud music. Prepare to listen to background noise, not your music. This thing sucks. Don't buy it."
2,Transformers,"This item was suppose to contain a digital copy but it only has a Blu-ray and a DVD disk. The digital disk was not included, from the package and from your advertising it was suppose to be included. What happened?"
2,it's oh...so great!,"possibly maybe best work ever done by Bjork,Post is a crossover of idm,trip hop and whatever dance music in the middle 90's is meant to be.From the marvellous orchestration of Isobel,to the exuberance of I miss you Bjork proves there's nothing she can do less than perfect"
2,Back to basics...,Sometimes back to basics is the clearest path towards understanding current realities. It is amazing to me that a book written in 1946 is still so fundamentally relevant.
1,Poor quality - leaking,"The swaddlers are wonderful diapers, never had any problems, however, the Dry Baby diapers are terrible. We have gone though one box of them, and still have another one to go before we switch over to cloth (this is not the reason we are switching to cloth). My son has woken up several nights in a row completely wet and we've been having to change the sheets. They leak horribly. Even daycare hates them. We've had so many blowouts as well. They are incredibly thin and cheap feeling."
2,Great Jazz Album,"Until I checked the amazon reviews page, I had never met a single person who had heard this album and didn't absolutely love it. I'm not saying that the single star givers aren't entitled to their opinion, but my experience is that my large swathe of Jazz Fan friends would unanymously give this 5 stars. It is not hard bop, but it is beautiful, whether you invest in the spirituality of it or not. This is one of the great albums of all time."
2,Both excellent and important,"Orwell's 1984 is the best reason for people to read. It demonstrates clearly and horrifically what can happen to an uneducated society that allows itself to be controlled due to it's own fear of initiative. Anyone who asks me why I read is automatically referred to this book, which is as important now as it was when it was written."
1,Worthless,It should have got 0 rating. You could buy a English-French dictionary instead of buying this. This does not 'teach' you anything. Do not spend your heard earned money on this
1,Not good at all,I got one of these a year ago. The issue I had was that the thing only had about 15mins of power before shutting down. That is usb or powering a 7w fluorescent bulb AC.
2,Beautifully Done,"The story of hester is by itself a master piece worthy of its highly commended status, however the annotated version really helps the reader understand the historical references and many archaic words."
1,Nothing personal at all....,"...Clay has an amazing voice...very clear and strong. Honestly, I just don't like the songs or his style. It's not that he can't sing. I guess he just doesn't sing the music that I like to hear. I was given this CD as a gift...why?...I don't know. It was a gift from a secret pal and I guess whoever pulled my name at the beginning of the year doesn't know me very well. If you like Clay's kind of music, you'll love this CD because he sings it well. Me? I guess I'm just more of a typical R&B fan. Love Ruben's CD...love Tamyra's CD...love Kelly Clarkson's CD...but just couldn't get with this one. Nothing personal. I probably just never should have listened to it. My bad."
1,The Worst!,"A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book."
2,This is the book that made me love reading...,Growing up I thought my my mother and sister were so boring because they read so much! I hadn't read anthing that interested me until Alvin. My mother and sister still may be boring at times but reading is exciting! Thank you Mr. Hicks!
2,It was very sad I thought too see a friend turn on you,It was a wicked book just very emotional it was great in the sense of friendship between too people. I would recommend the book to just about anyone.
1,Weisz and Hounsou are great but the movie is a huge mess.,"I don't know much about the comic but regardless of it, it's still a really bad movie. Keanu Reeves is with out a doubt the worse actor we have around, giving a performance that kills this movie and makes everything about it into a joke. The only three actors who do make it out of the film with their dignity intact is Rachel Weisz, who I agree with almost everybody gives the films only great performance, Djmon Hounsou, who makes a more believable sorcerer than Keanu Reeves and Peter Stormare, who's brief appearance does more for the climax than the stupid gun fight.Too bad nether Weisz, Hounsou or Stormare could have saved this film, that's how bad Keanu and the rest of the movie is."
1,Bad Inventory,"Your inventory of Futuro Knee braces is bad and is being investigated by one of your Customer Service persons. I speak with confidence because I have worn the same brand, style, and size brace for years. The first shipment of 2 braces consisted of one correct package but the other was a ""small"" size clearly marked [package and product lable] as ""medium"". When the exchange shipment arrived, both packages contained ""small"" size braces but the lables and packages were clearly marked ""medium"".Both shipments have been returned in the last few days. In my mind this is obviously a manufacturers problem. To this day Amazon has been trying to resolve this issue. I am waiting for instructions on how to obtain the proper items."
2,An excellent book,"I read this book for the first time when I was 10 and I've read over again several times. The book is so worn out from me reading it, I'm going to have to get another copy soon. The writing is very detailed; I could see everything in my head as I read it. I love the characters in the book, especially Kit and Nat. They and the other characters seem very real. The story never gets boring and the ending is good too. It's one of my favorites."
1,Core Sports Performance,A complete disappointment and waste of time. The narrator couldn't seem less interested; almost as though bothered by the project. Look somewhere else for a sports hypnosis cd.
2,The ONLY translation of Schure's play...,"**This is the only book that Schure's masterful drama is given in an English translation.**This book is so rare, and I mean so rare that I had to go to a small town called Dornach in Switzerland to find it!!!And of course, it is out-of-print, and so unknown that it will probably never be re-printed again in history....not to say even performed, unless a Schure enthusiast like myself undertakes a task like that!This is the play that the philosopher Rudolf Steiner took as the model to his own 4 Mystery Dramas. Schure (who was friends with the composer Richard Wagner) was one of Steiner's greatest admirers, and vice versa, and interestingly enough Schure was the one to introduce Steiner to his future wife Marie von Sivers!This play by Schure is really a monument to all ancient Drama and heralds in the new Dramatic form taken up by Rudolf Steiner. A wonder and deep inspirational experience."
2,Deep Texas Soul,"Vastly underrated and underrecorded Texas soul and funkster's mid to late 60's recorded output for Huey P. Meaux's Crazy Cajun label. Medwick was a staff songwriter during the 50's and 60's for Don Robey's Duke/Peacock label where he penned several successful hits for Bobby Bland including, ""further on up the road"" and ""cry cry cry"". Although, known less for his singing than his songwriting abilities Medwick proves well beyond a dobt that he's got more than an average set of pipes, convincingly tackling everything from the guttiest of gut wrenching ballad's to sanctified soul, Texas funk and r&b numbers.This disc is certainly worth it's weight in soul, my only complaint being the sometimes oppresive church organ which challenges rather then compliments Mr.Medwick's efforts. A nice find for lovers of no frills deep fried southern soul!"
2,I HATE THE IDEA OF NO BOOKS!,"""Fahrenheit 451"" is about a future where there is no freedom of speech. A future where every person is a mindless automaton with no feeling. They go about their life wondering whats going to be on the screen next or what they're going to eat for dinner. Worst of all it is a future where there are no books. It is a future where firemen don't douse fires, it is a future where they start them. Their job is to rid the earth of books by burning them.Montag is a firefighter who is questioning what he is doing. Lately he has been stealing books from the secret libraries he burns for a living. He finally realizes that without books people are mindless automatons who's only purpose in life is not to think.This is a great book and it makes you think of what life would be like if our only purpose in life was to be happy. We wouldn't be able to think for ourselves, just like the characters in the book. I give ""Fahrenheit 451"" five big stars."
1,Oh dear,"I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but ""more than equal."" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
1,not for everyone ...,"Well, it depends what you want. If that is another cute fantasy film with Disney-esque animals and wise-cracking, snogging, contemporary teenagers (""Sorted!""), plus some soft-cheesy music at the end, then this is your movie. If you want something that Lewis might have regarded without horror and despair, this isn't it."
2,Great for smoothing and repairing sensitive skin,Some days my skin is very oily and other days it is dry. I use this a few nights each week to even out troubled-looking areas. It is very gentle and leaves my face looking and feeling healthier in the morning.
1,Item seemed like it was used not a new product!,Item seemed like it was used not a new product! Oh well it is just a cheap toy and the kids will probably tear it up in a couple of weeks anyway!
2,Loy & Powell,Myrna Loy and William Powell Collection (Manhattan Melodrama / Evelyn Prentice / Double Wedding / I Love You Again / Love Crazy)Is there a better way to spend the day than with the charming Powell or the beautiful & witty Loy. The best ever coupling of two hollywood stars. If you enjoy watching class in action or witty dialogue you will love these 4 movies especially Manhattan Melodrama that has the extra bonus of the wonderful CLARK GABLE.
1,This book wasn't near as good as the others,Gillian came off as a wimp. Angel was ok. They should have made Gillian seem more like a real girl and not someone from a soap opera.
1,"We all WANTED to like it, but it stinks.","Hmm.. I actually really like Keanu, but this was not a good role for him. If he had played it a bit more like Depp in 'Pirates...' it may have been ggoofy fun. The only amusement comes from Swinton and Stormare as Gabriel and Satan respectively. Plus, Gavin (Bush's frontman) is creepy enough. Weisz's performance is nothing special (her accent always stinks!).As people have said the story makes no sense. It is tentative in its storytelling... is this an action film or a religious film? Problem is it fails to be either or both. The only grace outside of Stormare and Swinton is that the visuals are cool.If you haven't seen this, just walk away, rewatch the Matrix or something like the Ninth Gate for creepy religous movies."
1,Sucralose!,This popcorn is sweetened with sucralose. Do a search to read about sucralose. I'm not eating this or feeding it to my family.
1,the movie was better,"Usually the book is always better. In this case, no way. I found it to be just a bunch of disjointed ramblings and partial recounts of what happened. I couldn't even finish it and gave it away. The movie didn't follow the book at all, but at least there was a thread of a storyline to follow."
2,"Broad, excellent overview, but will not please everyone","Like every treatment of the Arab Israeli conflict, this book will not please everyone (or anyone?). The book is brisk. Fortunately, Morris has an even tone throughout and does not remain fixed on any one subject for too long. As anyone knows who has written on a broad topic, this is an exceptional accomplishment. Even at 600 plus pages, this book could have easily gotten bogged along the way on the wealth of detail about this well researched conflict. And this book shows that despite some of Morris' more inflammatory interviews recently, he can still present a work of historical research that is even handed and fair."
1,Confusing and lacks editing,Some parts make no sense at all as you read through this book. In one sentence in the book Green says not to remove the fan leaves and three sentences later he says to remove them. This is very confusing and shows a lack of editing. Growing errors are littered in this book making it frustrating to read.
1,Sent wrong book,I ordered Introduction to Social Problems (6th Edition)and they sent me Introduction to Sociology (5th edition). The books don't even have the same authors. When I tried to amend the problem they never responded to me.
1,Just not my kind of book - Others liked it.,"It isn't my kind of book but, I thought, I would give it a try. We read it in our book club. Some of the readers liked it, most of them didn't. I didn't. But, the author did have great insight to the future in the 1950 - 1960's"
2,"The other side of ""A brave new world ""","This science fiction novel walks around the speculative situation about a natural (not social and not even political choice) population distribution, in agreement his skills and gifts.Naturally many facts occur in this interesting tale , but the most remarkable issue is to make us think the elusive dreams about a better and even pacific society."
1,"Boring, hackneyed, terrible acting","Beware the five-star reviews. This is a slow, cliche-filled, horribly-acted, unfunny, cloying disaster of a movie. I'm a big Zach G. fan, but he doesn't begin to salvage this crappy flick."
2,Dark Fantasy with MORALS,"I loved this book, because it teaches people why not to have enemies due to consequences. Judging people like saying someone is a dork, jock, etc. could be murderous like in the book they killed themselves. It is realistic but fiction."
1,DisCONTINUUM immediately!,"The producers of this franchise know they have a great fan base, but now after several years of making an intelligent and entertaining sci-fi series I think they've given in to intellectual laziness. If ""Continuum"" is the new standard of what we (the fans) can expect to see in the future from this franchise, then they should just stop making these films now. The plot to ""Continuum"" is silly, the narrative (the story and how it is told) is completely bland and devoid of life. It was as though all these characters we have come to know, suddenly had their souls written out of the script."
1,Terrible Book,"This book is contrived, poorly written, and far-fetched. It casts Church conservatives as evil and diabolical men trying to thwart the will of God by hiding and/or destroying the revelations from Fatima and Medjugorie. It turns out that the 'revelations' are based on God's dissatisfaction with Church doctrine in areas that liberals are always whiny about.(...)So the repeated appearances of the Virgin Mary were due to her anger that the Church opposed homosexual marriage, abortion, female priests, and allowing priests to marry and have families. How lame and predictable. (...)"
1,nelly is so hood...............................syke,"i gotta admit, i liked nelly back in '99 wit country grammarbut he went commercialgrillz iz da wackest beat i eva heardbut niggaz love itand paul wall needs 2 get his pussy poppedcuz he makin it even harder 4 white boyz 2 make it bigthanks 2 him itz gonna be harder cuz when i send my demo 2 somebody dey gon be all like ""he prolly like paul wall"" comparin me 2 dat bitchwell daz my review~1~"
1,Overrated,"Marlon Brando is a marvelous actor, but PLEASE someone ELSE write his dialogue! On how many different occasions in one film do we need to hear about pigs? I have never understood why this movie is lauded so much, so I decided to give it another chance. The dialogue is simply absurd. Who talks like this? The relationship between Brando and the young French girl is very S&M;, but in my opinion, these themes were explored better and more attractively in ""9 1/2 Weeks"". If you're looking for nudity and graphic sex, you won't find that here either. The sex scenes are few and far between, and when they do occur your reaction will most likely be ""OH! MY EYES!!""A film without a writer is a recipe for disaster, and it really shows here. Skip this. You're not missing a thing."
2,Asimov,Great sci fi read. The originality is so that many movies n shows depicting space must have read the series.
2,Continuing enjoyment through the years,"This has been a favorite film since my first viewing when it was initially released. The tension of the times and the quality of acting combine to reflect Hellman's personal experience. I wanted to add it to my very select library of film, now available on DVD."
1,Ok ...,Not Worked on my baby.... he drinks plenty of water.. so obviously tooks more diapers at night times...i was keep on changings 2 or 3 times every night ...it didnt set for babies who takes plenty of water
2,G Wizzle and C Bizzle students at Mace's Lane-izzle,"""Of Mice and Men"" is a lonely story of two hobos, Lennie and George. Lennie is a large man with a mental disability and a craving for soft things and George is a small man who's in charge of Lennie, making sure he isn't getting them in trouble. The men had to flee from Weed because Lennie was accused of raping a woman when he only wanted to feel her dress.They find a ranch outside of Weed and work there. There they meet a rambunctious man by the name of Curley who threatens to knock out any man's lights if they even consider looking at his jail-bait wife. Curley is the ranch owner's son so, he's never going to get into trouble. When Curley and Lennie cross paths, something terrible happens. ""Of Mice and Men"" was a very good book that we both enjoyed. Some of the hobo-dialect is a little hard to understand but pretend you're the characters (like we did) and you'll find out what a good book this is!"
2,Thank goodness...,"... that Oprah chose this book for her Book Club. Because, you know, that Nobel Prize endorsement is just so overdone. (Does anyone know if she has reviewed the Bible yet? the Torah, perhaps?)As a fan of 'stream of consciousness' (or to quote a fellow poster, ""rambling'), I actually enjoyed GGM's style. It was a struggle at times, though. But I would recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their streams of consciousness. I suppose if anything positive may be said about the Oprah Book Club, it's that it at least encourages people to read GGM's work."
2,Wow! What a great CD,"I waited for over a year for the new cd to come out, and my wait was worth it. I love the cd. I love Vanessa'a voice and I love the melody of her music."
2,overjoyced!,"What a zen master would state in a 3-line Haiku poem, Joyce says in a 700-page book, with ever dancing, ever-changing words in an amazing, multi-levelled labyrinth, more suitable and charming to Western intellect than Oriental thought. Definitely NOT the first Joyce book to read. Life is a wake, live it or krikkit!"
1,The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,"It didn't keep me engaged and wanting to continue reading it. I found it ""dry"" and not interesting. I never finished it. I believe it was a ""Free"" book, glad I didn't pay for it!"
2,I love this stuff,"The Pills are gel caps a lil larger than i thought they would be ,but i bought this to clear up acne and control pms symptoms and so far i love it and my skin is looking amazing after only 3 days so i would reccomend this to every one also a plus my cervical mucus is back i was dry before so i just love this product"
2,Good product,"I bought this over five months ago to replace a leaky ball (a different brand). This one is still firm from the initial inflation. It's round, it's the specified size, and it doesn't leak. What more can you ask of a ball?"
2,This works great,Quick delivery on these 2 wireless adapters let us install and get our TIVO up and running in no time. These adapters allows our two tivo's to basically talk to each other. We can watch what is recording on one can be view on the other. Great reception as well. The TIVO people will walk you thru installation if necessary.
2,Purchased for Gift,"While I'm not the one wearing them, they certainly are attractive and classic in style. Build quality appeared good. We are actually going to laser engrave on the side of the canvas part to customize for a friend. They will be Supah cool!"
2,"Good Value, blew my GeForce 2 away",I love this card. It is a great value and supported DirectX 8.0 very well. It is a good value at only $.. compared to at least $... for a GeForce 4. The DDR memory really makes a difference over the SD in the GeForce. I replaced a GeForce 2 32mb with this card and did not have any problems installing it. My Pentium 4 with 394mb RDRAM and this card run Operation Flashpoint and Battlefield 1942 really well. A+
1,Seriously Flawed,"Bottom line, there are some serious flaws in the author's thinking. For example, in chapter 11 (Tariffs), the author argues that imposing a $5 tariff on an import (sweaters from England) ends up costing the US. Never once does he add the $5 duty received into the equation. How can someone argue against an import tax without analyzing what happens to the revenues from that tax? When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports, I quit reading.In short, I couldn't agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costs/benefits focus is too narrow. Yet, in trying to expanding the analysis beyond the 'too narrow', the author's analysis in fact is often too narrow."
1,The plot is disconnected and unnecessarily tragic.,"Kathy Reichs uses too much narrative for my taste. The main character, Tempe Brennan, is not particularly likeable and it is not clear why she chooses to do some of the things she does. For instance, what was the point of the ""mugging""? Why didn't she at least tell Ryan about it? Maybe I would understand had I finished the book. I feel betrayed by her weaving me into her life and then killing her cat. I am not an activist but I don't understand a writer who feels he/she needs to kill an animal for what? Shock effect? I understood the reason for the other deaths - even the babies - which were remote and had some purpose to the plot. But to make the reader feel warmth and love for Birdie, through her writing in both books, and then kill him? I didn't feel it worth my time to finish the book. Nor will I read another of hers."
2,a good time for all,"Characters brimming with personality, and locations beyond imagination, it's hard not to get lost in the imagination of Periphery Stowe right along with Riggs.Though at times showing evidence of being a first novel, it hardly detracts from the beatiful prose and obvious skill the author has for writing.spread it around to your neighbors, your kids, your neighbors kids, all will enjoy.I'm just wondering what tricks Wagner has up his sleeve for his next book.."
1,Strong??? Nope... this one just doesn't cut it,"This tool attracted me at first because of the concave shape of the jaws. My current cable cutter is a basic straight edge cutter, and it does the job well, but sometimes the cables slip out of the jaw since the blades are straight. So, with this curved jaw, I was pretty excited (as one can be for a hand tool).My tool arrived today and I decided to test the cable cutter out on a piece of shielded 1/8"" stranded wire. First attempt, EPIC FAIL!!! It cut through the plastic sheath and only one piece of the wire strand was actually cut through, the rest, just bent at the point of contact.What's worse? The blade on the bottom jaw got chipped. Very disappointed in this tool, when my generic wire/cable cutter can do the job at half the price. Tool looks well designed and strong, but the blade edge is way too thin and fragile. This tool is being sent back to Amazon..."
2,classic,"I read this after watching the Disney film and was not disappointed. Enjoyed it immensely a novel well ahead of it's time and gives the reader an even broader perspective of the main character ""John Carter""Having never read ""Edgar Rice Burroughs"" I never knew what I was missing. ""SUPERB!"""
2,Love it!,"I originally purchased this for my pregnancy, as I was using 5+ pillows for support, and i was tired of chasing them as they fell off the bed all night long. I loved the support and have slept with it ever since. (i even take it with me on trips.) its great because of the refluff-able fill and because you can roll over and not have to move it. I have yet to wash it in the laundermat and see how it turns out.one con, because of its size, it can be difficult to fluff... do it in the morning while you have energy, not at night when you're ready to go to bed."
1,Diapers had strange stain,Some of the diapers in the box had a strange stain on them! Had to throw them out. What a waste. LM for Amazon to provide a refund.
2,awesome,"I thought Patrick Stewart did a fantastic job. He showed great feeling towards ""The great white whale"". I have seen this movie 3 times and I still enjoy watching it. It was much better than I was expecting. I wish this movie had been around years ago when I had to read the book in school, it would have given me a better perspective of it. also it would have made the book easier to read. I loved the movie!"
1,What a disappointment...,"Last Days was easily the worst movie I have seen since Eight Heads in a Duffle Bag. From start to finish, it was disjointed and each scene was entirely too long. In fact, I watched the last 30 minutes of the move in 10x speed and didn't miss a thing!Van Sant did not establish any kind of connection with the characters. You don't really even know Blake is a troubled musician (as it says in the synopsis) until half way through the movie, so you spend time watching him mope around the house in, what appears to be, a drug-induced stupor. But you really don't know what's wrong with him and it's not very interesting to watch.I had high hopes for this movie, especially after watching the making of it in the Special Features section, but it was a complete waste of time."
1,A waste of time and money,"Good cast, high budget movie. The movie was supposed to concentrate on a group of 4 people (all insomniacs) who were going to stay in an isolated house, to test their reactions to pressure situations.Was it the lack of direction, the lack of story line, or the lack of interest from the actors that led this movie to become a flop ?Watching this movie was a chore. It was about as exciting as ""The Avengers"".There's not a lot that can be said, apart from save your money and get a better movie (The Sixth Sense was made on a cheaper budget & was far more exciting)."
1,zzzzzz.....,"I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and have been reading these books for 20 years. I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great, and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid, but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money. Unless of course you're a chronic insomniac; then, by all means, buy this book."
2,The Best Sherlock Holmes -- And That's Saying Plenty!,"I have read and enjoyed many a good Sherlock Holmes story (e.g. ""The Red-Headed League"" is a winner), but at the very top of the book stack I would place ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"". Who could ever forget the atmosphere that Arthur Conan Doyle evokes by his use of those misty moors!In teaching English (Literature) to a class of 7th & 8th grade boys, I was at first a bit hesitant to introduce this novel as our text. Would a group of squirrelly junior high boys find anything of interest in a book written in 1901? Answer: I needn't have worried. They loved it (and so did I)! The fog from the moors drifted right into our classroom.First-rate mystery tale with one of the most famous fictional characters ever created. ENJOY! (But keep an eye out for a frightful luminescent hound next time you're walking home at night - just in case)."
1,My Son finds it annoying,"My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD."
1,barry marshmallow,I only listened to one song and please that was all i needed this type of music is just thatit really doesn't fit anywhere but broadway stage you talkin about a one album wonder. In this business everyone knows it is not just about how many albums you sell it is about longevity which people seem to forget about and please believe me when i say clay most likely did not doany writing. so who's really getting paid the songwriter of course. So don't let sales blow your mind understand most of that money went back to the record company. And i am not a fan.
2,Good for the price,"I have had mine for a month now and have to say I have enjoyed it. The Pros:Price! Almost half what an ipod would cost you! I don't care how it looks and I always drive so the size is not important to me.Sound quality is wonderful, I really like the smart volume sound normalization. Yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway. I quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song/playlist etc fast enough. I also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer!Cons. Creative software stinks. It's horrible. redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more! The front cover can pop off easily but I always have mine in the case so I didn't notice after first day."
2,Great Movie,"This is a great movie and a visually stunning one -- so it's worth having in a Blu-ray edition. The sexual content is not as shocking as it was when the film was first released, but it's still an emotionally powerful and unnerving work."
1,Disaster,The new illustrations are a complete disaster. The stories in Scary Stories To Tell In the Dark are fine. What made the book great were the illustrations. These new ones are a disaster and everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves.
2,Cowboy snuggie...,I gave this poncho as a birthday gift to my husband. He loves it so much he wears it while he watches TV. Of course he falls asleep wearing it! I recommend it highly.
2,Helpers when playing cards,We play a card game that requires holding several cards. These card holders are a huge help. I really like having multiple colors.
1,A waste of time,"Don't get me wrong, I believe in UFOs and certainly Mothman, since my friend's aunt saw it, but 90% of this ""nonfiction"" book is nonsense. Keel's semi-acurate listing of the real life mystery of Mothman wins it a single star, but the speculation that he pushes as the gospel truth is laughable, and is mostly based on questionable facts and ideas that are theoretical at best. If you want to know about Mothman read James Cohen's Book of Mysterious Beasts, if you want to waste your time and Amazon's time, buy The Mothman Prophecies."
1,Eh.,"I was really disappointed with this book, especially since it was so highly recommended by friends and in general. I guess perhaps when it was written the ideas Fromm expressed were new, or at least the way he expressed them were new, but I can't believe that any minimally self-aware person hasn't thought about at least 80 to 90 percent of these ideas themselves. Fromm seems to be the typical over-educated, intellectual psychologist/philosopher, who takes a simple idea (if you don't know and love and understand yourself and the world around you, you can't love another person) and over-analyzes it, giving historical and biblical examples. Just another 90-odd pages of psychobabble."
1,Not for the novice,"After reading just a couple of her receipies, I discovered this book is not for the faint at heart when it comes to baking. Although when I watched her on an early morning program, I gathered there was a more balanced experience of receipies. Her citation of types of flour is simply more information that I was interesting in having and boardered on what one might call flour snobbery. So far, the only method I have regularly incorporated in my pastry baking is her reference to chilling. So as all is not down the pastry funnel, I will pick and choose a few more receipies now and then to try."
2,Late to the party,"I never watched American Idol and I rarely listen to pop music, but I clicked on this CD one day and listened to the clips just to see what all the fuss was about. I liked what I heard, bought it, and I have played it every day since then. There's just something about it, there's not a bad track on there. Is it the most well-crafted, lyrically sophisticated CD made this year? No, but it is entertaining, catchy, and let's face it, Clay's voice could make the phone book sound good. There isn't anything that is going to appeal to everyone. If you like what you hear from the clips, you're going to like the whole CD."
1,do you hear air?,"This item loses air overnight. Must be inflated daily if not nightly. If you return this item the store won't take it back, you must ship to the maker at your expense. Or you must cut the air pump out because they don't trust you not to keep using it, like we have to trust them on their quality."
1,Not Happy,I recently purchased a used 8 GB View. It works well as a 8 GB View but will not support an 32 GB SD card. The literature on the internet said that it would support a 32 GB card.
1,Mis-leading packaging,"Curly, perhaps the most popular and most imatated stooge is on the cover, on the back and in all the pictures that come with this slick looking boxed set.But he is in only one of the three short films. (Also, there are hardly any short films that come with this. The other filler is cartoons, a movie without Curly and interviews and other junk.)This is not a good collection for fans of Curly. It is however good at misleading the 3 Stooges fan into thinking that he or she has found a gold mine of 3 Stooges material at a great price. Sadly, that is not to be.Instead of wasting your time and money on this blatent rip-off, you would be better off at building your 3 Stooges library on other collections that don't contain the words ""75th Anniversary Collection."""
2,Couldn't put it down.,"This was a great book. I must admit that some parts of the book, some of the chain of events seemed unrealistic and this frustrated me a little bit but it did not keep me from wanting to read more. I was ready to give the three and a half stars until I reached the end, where I was hit with sorrow that the book was coming to an end and the characters had grown on me. The ending had a huge effect on me and was symbolic in that life goes on but you will never forget the hardships and the happiness that made you who you are. From the beginning of the book, I felt attached to the serene 1900s Brooklyn setting of the book and I can only imagine the blend of hardship and morsels of happiness that those times brought to a child and his/her family. I was very sad to say goodbye to the characters in the book and goodbye to life in early 1900s Brooklyn."
2,Great Book!,"I just finished this book. Great story, great humor and all around great reading. I highly recommend it."
1,Didn't like them,"The first thing I noticed about these is they are very dense, with a very waxy but dry and gritty texture. And there really is only a slight chocolate flavor, with a strange aftertaste. They are filling though, but then again so is eating compressed cardboard!"
2,Fantasy/Martial Arts Extravaganza,"This movie was made to be a fantasy/martial arts movie, and it delivers as promised. I have a very extensive collection of Martial Arts movies and I can honestly say that this movie is one of my top 15 favorite movies. I gave it a 4 instead of a five because it does go a little overboard with the fantasy element, but not enough to distract you from the fighting, and believe me, there's a lot of it."
2,Vreeland is the ultimate icon!!!,What a life!What a Lady!!Diana Vreland's book is a must for all fashion victims out there.You really get an insight of the weird fashion world.I really recommend this book.It's relly funny!
1,Although to call it garbage is a bit harsh,"Songwriting lacks creativity, almost all straight major chords. Singer has good voice. There's much better electronica available."
1,"I am yet to receive this book, first time I ever had a problem",I am disappointed that the book has not yet come. I have always used Amazon and never had a problem before. I assume the seller is to blame. My calls have produced no results
1,Ethanol is for drinking,"I would not recommend this book. Anyone looking into alternative fuel should consider biodiesel, or electric power. Ethanol is a waste. Anyway, this book provides some useless diagrams of how to not make a still at home."
1,Flyboys,"What A Stinkbomb! A cross between a video game & high school play, what were they thinking? One blaring fault is that No One Smoked! How can you make a film about WWI & not admit they smoked? This bunch did & it really bothers me as it's playing the past - this is a trend I'm seeing in American productions about history - what else are they changing that young audiences won't pick up on?"
1,Not good for regular use,"This ball is great when it's inflated, but it doesn't seem to stay that way for long. When I pump it up on a Monday, it's already soft by Tuesday and needs another pump to be usable for anything but bouncing around. I'm pretty disappointed with its performance but waited too long to start using it and therefore am unable to return it..."
2,Drinking music,"I stumbled on this album by hopping from list to list on Amazon. It caught my eye and I read the reviews on it and purchased it without even so much as hearing a track performed by Bonnie Prince Billy or any of his various other incarnations. Admittedly, the first song, ""A Minor Place"" is kind of a dud in my opinion. It generally annoys me but a few times as of late, it has seemed a better song. The rest of the album, however, is all beautiful, haunting tracks featuring Oldham's amazing song-writing and his simple voice that seems as old as time itself.Some of the particularly strong tracks on this album include Nomadic Revery, I See A Darkness, Today I Was An Evil One, and Black. And for the record, track 4 is called ""Another Day Full of Dread"", not Bread.Quite simply, this is an album with a beauty and haunting quality that cannot be described with words. It is also some of the best music to listen to while drinking with a close friend."
2,A NEW ASSKICKING MOVIE MADE BY LLOYD,"this movie whas relly great.the movie is much action in it much fighting.and its hilarius very good movie.the director lloyd kaufman did it again a new toxic avenger movie that gets a 9/10this movie isnt just one dvd its 2 dvd with one special feature with an including 95 minute dokumentary""apocalypse soon!""and much more special features.i got this movie as a present.you should go to the nearest store and buy this DVD.CITIZEN TOXIE:THE TOXIC AVENGER IV."
2,love it,"Thank you for making my baby happy, he is very into this type of music. just waiting for the next cd"
2,A great study of the human psyche,"Circa 1962 Clavell astounds the reader with his insight to the human condition. From the beginning until the end, King Rat never ceases to surprise and evoke the dark humor concurrent withthe grim reality of terrible circumstances. I remember seeing this book in countless rucks during Viet Nam, read and re-read, taped together, dog eared and in heavily stressed condition then, passed along."
1,Not worth it!,I thought this book was overrated and disappointing. The plot was undeveloped and lacking and the characters were not lifelike. the ending was abrupt and silly. Overall the book was a major disappointment and not worth my hard earned money.
2,Tehe sadest book I've read.,"This book is the reallity of life. People always take advantage of those who can't be self-suficient. however, people should help other people even if they don't always like it, just like george did."
1,Not what I expected as a big stooges fan,"This is not a collection of shorts, as you would expect it to be. Rather, it's a disappointing collection of odds and ends. As others have noted in other reviews, there are only a few shorts. You're better off finding a different collection if you want to see the shorts, just as I will end up having to do. I think the case is very misleading as it says there is over 11 hours of material there and it doesn't specify what the material is."
1,Guess i missed what was cool,"I bought this thinking that it was going to be one of those major life-changing experience moments in horror or something. As i said in my title... I guess i missed what was cool. It was ok for a low budget, but even then i guess i just didn't like the story, concept or style of the movie at all. People running down an alley flailing their arms does not invoke terror to me... sorry. So i suppose this movie ranks as a: Either you hate it or Love it kinda thing. Watch a trailer, if you like what you see go for it."
1,There are not very many books I hate. This is one of them.,"I find this books to be incredibly disrespectful of it's own contents. The information is at best laughable and at worst horrifyingly stupid.Others have mentioned the concept of the 'new' triple Deities(as everyone knows that you can create deities just by reading about them in a book and wanting them to exist *real* hard). I also found the concept that these deities would be thrilled with offerings of trash and garbage particularly 'interesting'(by which I mean nonsensical and silly.)This book is garbage of the lowest common denominator. A sheer money grab by a person who lives in a self created commune in a rural area. If I could chose one book to permanently remove from all bookstores and shelves this would be seriously in the running for that spot. Dare I say it - worse then SWR if only because everyone knows she writes garbage whereas people, for some reason, think this is the best stuff ever."
1,"Don't waste your time, money, energy on this stinker!","I didn't realize this movie was a comedy when I went to see it, but I did end up laughing through most of it because it was such a piece of garbage!"
1,Advertising,"It is one brand name after another, don't waste your money.<br />This book has more fluff then recipes that you can use everyday, plus it will not save you money with all the package and can food you have to search out and buy."
1,Most overrated book of the century,So if nobody understands what the heck the author is trying to say means that the book rates five stars? I think not.
2,It Was Hard To Put Down!!,I like everything that I've read from Ms. Jackson and this is no exception. I had a hard time putting this book down and just finished reading it and now I am sorry it's over.
1,burned 3 times!,"I bought this for my daughter last Christmas. She was so excited she started playing right away. Shortly after she said there was a glitch. 2 Frodo's would suddenly appear on the screen. I took it back, and since you can only exchange the item for the same item we did. Again the glitches. During battle the players would split and you'd have 2 Frodo's or Aragorn etc.. on screen. We threw it out. Later we found several on a discount rack, Spiro's, race cars and LOTR's. So I figure what the heck, third times the charm right? WRONG. The third one had glitches also. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Especially because it wasn't an all battle game. It has action and puzzle solving too. It just should have had the glitches worked out before it was marketed."
1,A MAJOR ( PUN INTENDED) DISAPPOINTMENT,"I was so disappointed in this book. Having read most of Feinsteins other works. It was certainly not, "" Inside the Ropes"", as the sub title implies.I was totally bored by the business end of the open. Aside from the introduction, the golfers don t enter the book for about three hundred pages.I found myself skimming to get to the good stuff, which took a long time to materialize."
1,Disappointing and deceptive,"Poor quality recording, and though it calls itself ""Trinity Rides Again"" it is not a Trinity movie and lacks the humor and characterizations I was expecting."
1,Not as durable as I thought it would be.,"The crocodile dentist worked as it should for about one week. Great concept, but too flimsy. Pushing any of the teeth makes the croc chomp down. Not supposed to work that way."
1,"Honestly, a joke!","I am not one to be pessimistic or have a bad attitude in any way, but honestly.. I have to say that the first words that come to mind are that this DVD is a joke. With that being said, the one good thing that I can say is that it is at least entertaining and made me laugh. Sadly enough... being from Austin and listening to tons of live music for years, I cannot think honestly of a time when I have seen a worse live music show. Ringo doesn't even play on most of the songs and at least his band covers up, to a degree, his deficits. I will say that it appears that Ringo himself is enjoying it, which I have to give him credit for, but that doesn't mean that others will! When I first saw this DVD, I was really looking forward to actually to see Ringo playing live, not having heard much from him in years. I could go into more critical detail, but would prefer to just think of this DVD as an amusing entertainment experience, but for serious music lovers.. save your money!"
1,Disappointing,"I purchased these fireplace tools with great anticipation of beautiful, warming fires. The tools are cheaply made and if you don't put them into the holder the right way they get stuck and it's difficult to remove the handle. Do not recommend."
2,A Good Ponder...,"This book is not a fast read in the page turner sense but a very good ponder. If you like to ponder the big questions in life, this book should be on your shelf. The author has an amazing ability to see life so clearly and put it on the page. You'll find yourself saying, ""yeah, that's what it is!"""
1,Causes Kindle for Freeze,"This book causes my Kindle to freeze. Must do a complete reset to get it to work again. This is the only book, so far that caused a crash. I don't know if I will try to re-download it from Amazon. Weird huh?"
1,Disappointed,Into the Wilderness was absolutely top-notch so maybe my expectations were too high for Dawn on a Distant Shore. This story contained little action and far too much gossip. These wonderful outdoorsmen (and women) were confined to rocking in ships for 300 pages! I was as homesick for the mountains as Hannah was. I love Ms. Donati's characters but I was as uncomfortable as they were in their oversea adventure. I do hope she brings them home for the next installment. If I hadn't read the first book I would never have finished this one - the plot was too much of a stretch - but the Bonners are terrific and I had to know what happened to them.
2,Really great 'baby book' for your 4-legged children,"This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves their dogs as children. I bought one for our 3 year old adopted beagle, and am getting one for our daugher-in-law's birthday for their rottie. You can personalize it as you wish, and I have included comic clippings (Marmaduke, Mutts, etc.) that are appropriate along with the photos and have created the beginning of a great book for my best friend that I will keep forever."
1,Spun Out,"The best things about this heavily formula vehicle are (1) Elvis' opening production numbers (including a nicely staged ""Adam And Evil""); (2) Deborah Walley's ""girl drummer"" role; (3) the Deusenberg; and (4) Elvis' closing production number, the medium walking blues ""I'll Be Back"". Everything else is redundant."
1,A Real Disappointment,"This fan is a colossal waste of money - it's not worth the shipping cost, much less the purchase price. When the tent got hot, the poor performance of this fan was a real disappointment."
2,Angel-The Puppet Show,The VDO is good i like the angel episode:D...the puppet show wz ok but the VDO is worth it 4 just the Angel episode:D
1,"poor quality backpack, don't buy...","I bought this backpack when I wanted to have a new bag for my laptop. I got a good JanSport Backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one, so I chose JanSport again. It's out of question that JanSport is generally a good brand.But this particular backpack is really poorly made. The texture is made by some cheap materials, and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website. There are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings, and the space is not as big as that was described at all. Nevertheless, the laptop sleeve is too wide for my 15' widescreen notebook. So I bought another backpack of Swissgear this weekend when I saw it on sale with only one third price of this JanSport. And the quality of my new bag is Much Much Much BETTER than this one.Don't buy this backpack!"
1,Disappointing Follow up .........,"The book is definately a disappointing follow-up from Mail Order Bride. Its so hard to like Annie, who is out for herself and very immature. Usually in historical romances a 20 year old is a little more mature. So it makes it difficult to root for her and Colin, when all you want to do is smack her in the head.I love Maureen McKade's books, and I would tell you to read this, just to get closure from the whole Trevelyan tale. But man oh man, Kate and Trev raised a brat!!!!!! I expected way better. Sorry, Ms. Mckade..."
1,research before buying,"i have bought several of these types of camera's form other sellers that work way better. spend the extra couple buck for something reliable. now saying that, with the cost you can't be picky if you are willing to gamble.SECURITY - DON'T BOTHER ( the tuning is way to sensitive, whereas it it really hard to get a constant clear picture.I would not use it for home security of any type as i live in a townhouse, and when set up it literaly make a cracking sound on the monitor when the unit transmits through one wall. )the range is not 200 feet..... maybe 10 feet line of sight. the advertising is false and i think this is why it was a dissapointing buy. i spent $50 bucks on the same type of unit several years ago and it works through the entire house and outside with no problems. this one has trouble transmitting clearly in the same room if large.Sorry to the seller for the bad review, but people need to know the truth about the item."
2,Wonderful device,"I purchased this for my husband to load a recertification course on and study. He also has music on it and is enjoying it very much. It was a great price, especially for this much memory. And Amazon's service was great as usual."
2,Wonderful Storm,"By far- i must say, this must be one of the best movies during its time with an all black cast. The enterntain was great, but it had a creative storyline that went right along with what was going on in the film."
2,A great choice if you're looking for something simple,"Very simply, with few words, this book explains that there is a beginning and an end. In the middle is life. Beginnings and endings are going on around us all the time. For plants, animals and humans too. Everything has its own lifetime, some short & some long.Doesn't overdo it in sentiment or with pictures. There is typically 1 pictured item per page, not a lot to look at. This is perfect for the premise of this book staying simple & too the point."
2,Mystical truth accessible to everyone!,"What an awesome book! Author Hilary Hart offers intimate and really moving encounters with eight contemporary and mostly hidden mystics from different backgrounds, like Buddhism, and Sufism. It was amazing to read the ways so many different people can come to experience the divine.What sets this apart from so many spiritual books is it brings divinity down to earth wihtout losing the divinity!And finally, a spiritual writer who finds a way to be honest and real, herself. Not an ounce of pretension!!!"
1,Absolute Waste,I purchased this product last week and discovered that it was garbage. The strips shape is terrible and it does not remove the hair. Complete waste.....:(
2,Sad...Just Sad,Very quick read. Love the detail of the story and you just feel like you are right there with them. Sad is it? Indeed it is...if you're looking for a story that might bring a tear drop from your eye...this is it.
1,"""classic"" does NOT mean good!!!","If you havent been forced to read this book while in school, or hadnt had a chance to grab it at the library, run while you can. 1984 might have been scary 100 years ago, but not now. If you like reading about old people think they are beating the system by saving a PAPERWEIGHT, then by all means...The book has multiple plot holes as well. Beware the ""government runs the world unchallenged, but still needs to brainwash old people"" hole. Read something else instead... ANYTHING ELSE!"
2,Clay Aiken is a Gem,"I can't understand why some people are bashing this perfectly wonderful CD and the immense talent of its singer. What do these so-called ""critics"" (or ""bashers"") think real music is -- someone rapping in nonsense or screaming inaudible and offensive lyrics?? Clay Aiken is a breath of fresh air in this day and age and deserves the accolades he receives. Everyone with the money should spend it on this perfectly wonderful album -- not waste it on the mainstream of trash."
1,Self-absorbed garbage,"Of all that has been written about the 1996 Everest tragedy of errors, this is the weakest piece. It consists mainly of diary excerpts and the author's commentaries on them. The only insights for the reader are into the mind of an enormously driven, self-indulgent, and self-absorbed person. Reading this book is a waste of time and money."
1,"Good for the very religious, but not for the rest of us","A TON of the quotes in this book are religious in nature--whether they be bible verses, quotes about ""god in christ,"" about faith, praying, etc, etc! As an Atheist, I didn't appreciate having so many religious quotes in what is billed as just a book of quotes on ""Wisdom."" And they aren't only in one section of the book, but ALL OVER--in the sections about art, nature, love and friendship, conscience, etc! I feel like a ""bait and switch"" was pulled on me, and that this book should be advertised as a religious quote book. So I'd say buy it if you're religious and draw your inspiration from religion, but not if you aren't/don't."
2,best diapers,This is my baby's favorite diapers.It fits very well and Flexes for a snug and comfortable fit.Ultra absorb core for outstanding leakage protection.
1,THIS ITEM DESCRIPTION IS VERY MISLEADING !!!!,"This calendar begins with August 2005 and ends with July 2006! My son bought this for me for Christmas and was very dissapointed when I opened it and found out it was 'halfway used up' already. He felt very cheated and I felt very sorry for him. I think it is absolutely terrible that the item is not described truthfully. Shame, shame, shame on you! I wish I could give this item a negative number of stars!!!"
2,Warm & Comfy,"These boots are some of the most comfortable that I've ever worn. Even after being on my feet for more than 6 hours my feet felt good. The boots are very warm which is kind of a draw back since I live in Las Vegas. However, after a day of work I was pleasantly surprised to find my socks were still dry. These would probably be best suited for cold climate hiking, but they work pretty good in the desert. Well worth the money."
2,"they're back, they're better, and they'll continue that way","I know the members of the band and they're some of the greatest people out there and they're music is to match. William Goldsmith's drumming is amazing and his energy is not to be beat. Anyone who says that they're too quiet don't know anything about quality. This is quality few ever hear in music.They are talented and emotional and willing to experiment. More experiments with intense, emotional music will be on the next album. If you like this, check out Diary and the Pink Album."
2,better than Decameron,"To acknowledge the mastery of Chaucer you 've got to read ""Decameron"" by Boccaccio and ""The Consolation of Philosophy"" by Boethius.Read them and send me news on the online-review. ."
1,late shipping!!!,"Placed an order on 09/08/04, today is 10/08/04.I've been waiting for 1 month already and it still has not been shipped!!!Are you challenging the customers' patience???"
1,Boring,"I bought this book thinking that I would learn something or at least be given food for thought. What I got is a bad travelogue full of inane information about restaurants where the author ate, people he met, what he wore. There is nothing there for a serious or even amateur scholar. Just junk."
2,Dance album of the year!,"Wow! ...finally something new and creative for the dance floors this year. Got a promo of this album about a week ago and havn't stopped listening to it since. All of Mynt's hits in one place plus their new single ""Still Not Sorry"" which I think is really going to be a huge smash for them. Lot's of cool 80's production and fat synths on this one and I'd say it's definitely a worth while buy if u are into dance music/electrohouse 80's style./DJ Eric"
2,Fantastic read,The story kept me turning pages. Ms. Austin brings the Old Testament to life and gave insight to what can sometimes be overlooked passages. I found myself anxious for Hezikiah's life and his return to Yahweh. I can't wait to read the remaining books in the series.
2,Loved it! (P.S. Stephen Colletti is so hot!),"I initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti (who I'm in love with) was one of the leads...and I really didn't expect much from what looks to be a low-budget indie horror flick. But, I really did like it! The lead girl who plays Jennifer (Nikki DeLoach) is really good. I can't believe I've never seen her in anything before? Maybe I have, but I didn't know!?! It was cool to see the guy from Weekend at Bernie's (Terry Kiser)...he is a really good actor. Too bad he was dead the whole time in both movies I saw him in, lol. Anyways, this was a cool movie and I'm glad I got it!"
2,great movie,"this is just a great movie, nothin needs to be saidjust watch the movie and you'll know whyo yeah, did i mention, its an awesome movie!"
1,I don't get it.,"all right. i admit it. i don't get it. i had never heard of her before that irritating commercial started airing 500 times a day. i keep the remote handy just so i won't hear her bland, uninspired, amateurish rendition of a great stones song. this cd is all fluff. where's the emotion? what, does her dad own the studio?"
1,In the immortal works of Monty Python,"RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY.When and if it works, it looks great.I wish I could rate this at NO stars because of the paper jam or out of paper issue. I guess it's come to the point where we have to beg, plead and pray just to get something to work as advertised. I purchased this a Wal-Mart for $50, so I would bet that American manufacturers are thinking that ""if they only spend 50 bucks, what did they expect?"" ""They should have paid more so it will work."""
2,Large!,"Ordered through Amazon prime. Item arrived on time in perfect condition.You may not realize this product is HUGE! It's nearly the size of a container of oatmeal! VERY reasonable for the price, especially considering how much this stuff costs in a small spice container from whole foods.This is my first experience with nutritional yeast. The taste by itself kind of reminds me of those mystery fried chips you get at fairs sometimes.The product was sealed and even I could tell it was very fresh.I'd buy again."
2,Intex Pillow rest Twin,I ordered this for a friend who was displaced and has had to start over. He had a Airbed from a store but kept having to bring it back due to leaks and other problems. This bed looked much more comfy and with my Prime discount I sent it to him. Within the two day time frame it arrived and as soon as the other bed sprung another leak he put it to work. He says it's very comfy compared to the other so if he's happy I'm happy with the product
2,AWESOME CD!!!,"i just got this cd for my b-day and it hasnt left my cd player since. this cd is so amazing. my favorite song is ""Aerials"". the lyrics are so well written and the music to it is awesome. if u are thinkin about buyin this cd, stop thinkin and buy it."
1,Just a bad movie,"Poorly acted, written and plotted. Sci-fi and action movies are my thing but I couldn't get through this one as it seemed like all involved just ""phoned it in"". Worst movie I've seen in a long time."
2,Of Mice and Men,"The book Of mice and Men was a good book. It keeps you wanting to know more the whole way through. The characters are described very well, but the two main characters are opposite. One, named Lennie, is big tall and stupid, he acts like a five-year-old as they put it in the book. The other one, George, is short and kind of smart compared to Lennie. Unlike most of the other ranch hands the two are traveling together from ranch to ranch, and even more than others are because Lennie is always getting into trouble. Lennie loves soft things, which gets him into a lot of trouble. At this last ranch they think they will finally fulfill their dream and earn enough money to buy a piece of land, Lennie gets into the biggest mess of all."
1,Scarlett Letter,"Very disappointed! The book was missing several chapters. Because it was needed for school, we were forced to purchase another copy."
2,Fun for about 15 minutes.,"Very neat toy, although I think I liked it more than my 8 year old. My first one didn't come with directions, so we were a little confused on what buttons did what. The company sent us some directions after I called and it made it much easier. My favorite part was the lights in the ""horn"" that change colors. My daughter was only intrested in it for about 15 minutes though."
2,A must read for barn lovers....,"I was enchanted with this fascinating book on barn conversions. Barns are great relics from our past, conveying a sense of history, but many have been ruined by weather, time, and neglect. I didn't realize how many creative architects and owners have made barns useful for both residential and commercial use through renovation and restoration. The intrinsic character of these old barns brings an integrity and charm rarely seen in new construction. In many gorgeous illustrations, Rooney describes the history of barns, their adornment (who knew that it was all because of a 9th century pope that there are so many roosters on weathervanes?), and their use as gorgeous residences and fascinating commercial and establishments - including an architectural office, inns, and even a funeral chapel. One entrepreneur even used several to develop an office complex. If you love barns and if you like to see the past preserved in the present, you will love this book."
1,Out of Business,"These eMarker guys are out of business, so not sure if this thing even works any longer."
2,Easy!,Love ordering these from amazon! It's so simple and easy! It's great not having to run to the store to get diapers - these are delivered right to my door! What could be better than that?
2,great gift,my brother in law was thrilled with the clarity and instructional commentswill be looking for more titles by her
1,doesn't come with what's pictured......,"Does not come with gaskets!!!!!!!! These pictures are maddeningly misleading at times. I could have saved money buying another but this showed all I needed, but didn't come as promised."
2,Fun toy!,My 11 month old son received this for Christmas and he loves it. He loves to watch the animals pop up and make noises. It's fun to watch his face light up and hear him squeel with delight when he hits one of the buttons and the animal pops up.
2,She is a good singer.,Stacie Orrico is a good singer. She has a God given talent. Even though her ways have changed she always has the ability to sing.
2,A really good book,"Although this book kind of falls apart if you try to look at it as a realistic view of how human life was 35,000 years ago, If you view it simply as a fantasy novel it turns into a very good book.The story is not especially original (outsider is adopted into a society, big changes start to occur, etc...), but it is carried off very well. But where the book really stands out is in the detailed, sometimes almost too detailed, picture of the world. The author clearly knows the world, the animals, the plants, the conditions exceptionally well, and only rarely does she really go overboard in the detailing of this information.Although at times the structure is kind of awkward, especially when characters are thinking, it is a fascinating, absorbing and hard-to-put-down book with likeable, understandable characters.I definately recommend this book to everyone."
1,Worst ever,"I would have rated this minus 5, but that was not an option. This is neither instant nor is it DVD. It took 2 weeks of intensive work to try to get it to work--it never did! I even had to reinstall Windows XP! Tech support NEVER got back to me, and by the time you finally give up, its too late to return. This will make you homocidal! Don't waste your time and energy."
1,Uncomfortable pulsemeter,"While this unit may be as accurate as described, I nonetheless had to return it because it was an extremely uncomfortable, annoyingly intrusive fit on my wrist."
2,A Must Read For Ice Age Purists!!!,Thank you Auel for giving us this great prehistoric ice age novel. It is refreshing to see that the heroine is such a strong female character portrayed with so many different layers. It reminds me of Etok inThe Age of Eternal Firein how forward thinking they are from their tribe mates. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this delightful book and look forward to reading the rest of the series.
1,They really need to improve the pump,"While I think it's a good quality ball, the pump is terrible. Mine broke before it was fully inflated. The thing is about as cheap as they can possibly make it.Very disappointing that they can't provide a higher quality product."
2,Better than spiderman and x-men,"Yeah I said it big deal. Everyone is in this big hype of Spiderman and X-Men.Their used to fake action scenes not real action scenes like batman begins Both those movies sucked. What you want batman to act like a punk like wolverine or spiderman. Batman Begins is the real deal. Everyone is in denial that this movie is good. There just jealous that D.C. not Marvel came out with a better movie. Though I like marvel comics, Hollywood has ruind The Marvel moive franchise.I hope that SuperMan Returns will be just as good. D.C is coming back stronger than ever."
1,Not SYNC with the spirit of Amy Grant,"All the songs give you that ""uh, yep,,,right,,,ok"". If ya face facts,,,,Amy is due out for a ""Best of"" to make up for the really BAD songs lately she has produced that were not hits. Remember Journey's off songs,,,,,simuliar here with Amy Grants,,,,,,I have owned her entire collection to date and ""Heart of Motion"" CD is SO vastly superior to the rest of her CD's. I have loved the ""Angels"" song on the ""Straight Ahead"" Album for instance but not much else. You will not find this spirited type song on this album. She lost it"
2,thrilling thriller,"This mini-series is a taut thriller that I recommend to anyone. It's no surprise that an American version is in the works. It is well written, the charcters are real, the choice of actors is perfect, and none of the dialogue is gratuitous. Very compelling TV."
1,Riddled With Errors,This book is sloppy and riddled with errors. Coverage of topics is uneven. The author delves into some subjects but tap dances around others. You don't need this book for the FRM. I don't recommend it.
1,Very bizarre one-sided perspective,"I've read most of this book and the more I've read the more bizarre it is. Noble claims that hypertension, anemia, and gestational diabetes are natural aspects of pregnancy that can be harmful if treated. She says bedrest is actually harmful, that ultrasounds increase fetal mortality and left-handedness (???) and a host of other claims. She implies that those carrying multiples many years ago gave birth to healthy 7-lb each infants with none of the problems that some of us having multiples face today. She is an advocate for veganism, water births, home births, doulas and midwives and avoiding pain meds. Though my twins are big and healthy I certainly didn't take the advice in this book.This is not medically sound advice nor is it objective or open-minded. It is a book of extreme views."
2,Nice Book,"I think this is a good book even though I enjoy reading other kinds of books (like science fiction.) However, what I found special about this one is that it is very realistic. The characters and the situations in the novel makes you feel this happened in real life. The book is about the summer romance between two teenagers: Brenda Patimkin (one rich girl) and Neil Klugman (a poor boy). Neil sees her for the first time swiming in a pool, and falls in love with her. After that, they begin to love each other romantically; but after awhile they start having problems with each other, which will make you wonder if they'll stay together as a couple (but that's for you to read.) I'd say it is an entertaining book; it has funny parts, sad parts, happy and romantic. I haven't read other Roth novels, but this one is very good written. If you enjoy realistic novels, then it's a good choice."
2,Best and Most Realistic Horror Film of the Year!,"The entire family had a wonderful evening wathing ""The Haunting"" tonight. The scarriest part about it is that it is so realistic. You feel like you know the people and that you are there in the house with them! One of the best parts is the Special ""Behind the Scenes"" portion on the DVD. We really enjoyed this part of ""The Mummy"" but this was even better. A movie in itself! A good movie for a cold winter night (the kids will certainly join you on the couch!)"
1,two hours of my life I'll never get back,"I don't know what it is about this movie, but it's horrible. That's a particularly sad thing to say after Heroic Trio is one of the best Hong Kong movies in a long time. I'm not sure if I'm annoyed with Michelle Yoeh's prolonged death or her prolonged presence with nothing to do for the rest of the movie, or the fact that the husband is killed 20 minutes into the movie.It's not just that this is one of the dumber Hong Kong movies I've seen, it's also that it had a potential to be really great. It has great stars, it's a sequel to an amazing movie and it just falls flat. Too many places where nothing's happening, dumb jokes, awful musical montages and the fight scenes don't excite me.Nothing really to recommend in this movie. I suppose if you are a diehard fan of Anita Mui, Michelle Yoeh or Maggie Cheung (whose better in Green Snake) watch it, but be prepared to be disappointed."
2,Probably The Best Canadian release in this decade!!!!,"Less than a year ago I saw maybe a 30 sec. of one of her songs on MuchMusic, and I was...amased. I remembered her name, and soon I saw her perform live in Toronto on two occasions. MAGIC!!! I picked up a copy of her CD, and it's one of my favourite albums EVER. Beautiful!!! I'm allways on the lookout for interesting artists, being one myself, and I've been involved in the music industry for a long time working in a recording studio. I can't tell you ""Buy This"" because I think it is great-that's a personal opinion. But I can tell you ""Buy this"" because I like it and so will you, and anyone else you play it to. And if you ever have a chance to see her perform live, DO IT. It was the most intimate performance I ever saw artist deliver on stage. And her band shines with her."
2,Having a Ball!,Received this ball yesterday and was impressed that it came with both a pump and a DVD/CD with instructions for use. It took about 10 minutes to pump it up and it was immediately ready. I have not viewed the DVD yet and I have not read any of the instructions yet. I got some professional introduction to how to use the ball from my physical therapist. The quality of the ball is SOLID and it looks like it will last for a long time to come. The price on Amazon is better than local stores. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone that would listen.
2,Love it!,I am very happy with the weight and quality of this product. I wear this necklace often and love it!
1,stay away if u sre using T-Mobile MDA / T-Mobile SDA,Poor sound quality when paired with T-Mobile MDA / T-Mobile SDA.
1,"Paris, Wyoming","First off, my copy, Hudson House Publishers is a subsidy and self-publishing company. In old terminology, ""Vantage Press"" publishing. James paid to publish his novel. PARIS, WYOMING came as a gift as I generally do not purchase subsidy or self-published books or novels. Most do not exert ""tight"" editing and consist of numerous passive voice verbs and common writing errors. Secondly, I will finish this novel as my ""thank you"" to the one giving this gift. To complete reading PARIS, WYOMING, Wyoming will take forever. Lastly, whatever is the ""Wyoming Writers, Inc. 'New Horizons Award'"" as Jim James is a recipient?"
1,Didn't Last,I bought this for my 8 year old to sleep on in temporary housing during a corporate move. This bed didn't last two days and it came apart in the seam where we couldn't patch it. I would not waste my money on this product again.
1,Pathetically bad!,"This is some of the worst trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. The language is overwrought, the plot far-fetched and shallow, and even the readers sounded embarrassed to be involved in the project. However, it did make me laugh out loud quite often. Maybe the book was better. For a good S&M story, try Alasdair Gray's ""Something Leather"""
1,massivie waste of time,"this by far the most ,waste time i have ever spent on a movie let a lone money.a horrible try at predator and an complete failure. they did not even put letters on the dog tags,how pitaful.do not waste your money as i did.Sorbo is out of shape ,compltey,show's the same senre mutible times,who ever has been in a jungle with no incests ,sorbo was."
1,Makes it's point but pathetic (no pun intended) photography,"Coffee table book of girls at weight-loss camp, exotic dancers in Las Vegas, actresses, children play-acting withmakeup. Not sure if Ms. Greenfield was trying to emulate Cindy Sherman or Diane Arbus. Either way she has my sympathy."
1,"Started out fine, but petered out...","Too much time spent on secondary characters or too much time spent apart by the main characters made this very slow reading for me. I really liked Jake to begin with but I eventually came to not really care. The initial conflict was very strong, but then the author seemed to drift off and care more on Jake's in-law's relationship. The final conflict was resolved too easily for me to really buy into it.But it's not all bad. Ms. Wells writing voice is smooth and easy. I'd be interested to see what she comes up with in the future."
2,Solid game,This hockey game actually gives the player a challenge. You will not be able to score all the time like other hockey games and sweeping teams through the Stanley Cup Play-offs will not be easy at all. Hockey fundamentals come into play with this game and you must know how to run a power play. Great game!
2,Crazy to think about,"There is a lot of information and insinuations in this book - so many that I will definitely have to read it over and look deeper into Orwell's meanings. Most of it I did pick up on though and I must say that I love the story as much as I love Orwell's intentions with this book. Much more graphic of a novel than I first expected, and humorous at the most unexpected times, I know now why this is a classic novel."
1,1,"ive bought some cheap and bad games in my day but wow! really, this is the crappiest game i have ever bought. i finished it but was contastantly reminded how lame the gameplay was ALL THE WAY through the game. if you want to try a cheap game like this one that is good, get conan for a few bucks."
2,Majestic,"This is a masterpiece. Lhasa has a unique and powerful voice - flexible, sexy, and captivating. So subtle in its beauty, it will make you tremble. And the laments will crush your heart. I am not fluent in Spanish, but the music totally gets inside your skin. Beautiful arrangements, beautiful melodies, beautiful voice. It can only make your life better."
2,"John Steinbeck ""Of Mice and Men""","John Steinbeck`s novelette ""Of Mice and Men"" is about two friends who work as farmhands in California during the depression. George and Lennie are opposites in outer appearence and behaviour. The one, George, is small, smart and intelligent, but Lennie is huge, retarded and acts in a childish way. He has to rely totally on George. These two guys hold together because of two things: a promise and a common dream. George had to promise Lennie`s aunt Clara to take care of him after her death and so he does. Both dream of an own small farm where they can live and work for themselves and be happy.To realize their dream they earn their money as farmhands. A short time before their dream comes true Lennie makes a big mistake which ruined everything...""Of Mice and Men"" is an exciting story giving an imagination of the simple workers everyday life at that time with their hopes and dreams but also the problems."
2,FLYBOYS,I enjoyed this movie as it was entertaining with a war era/love story theme. It hit pretty high marks on both of these targets. The cinematography was nice and the love story was good. If you are looking for newsreel stuff on World War l go to the history channel because this will not take care of you. First of all it is in color not black and white like most everything you see there. To see Jennifer Decker get a role and nail it like she did makes this film a winner and a movie that will go in my personal collection. If you liked the movie Pearl Harbor you will really enjoy this film as well.
2,Comfortable,"These tend to run bigger than the Cruisers so if you're not ready to move up to the next size they help. I've had a few leakage issues though but that wouldn't deter me from giving this five stars. They move well too, when they get wet they don't become overly bulky"
2,camera lucida,"Great book for ALL photographers. It is out of print and available on here for a great price. Everytime I have read it, it offers new insight on how I view photography"
2,In good condition,"I ordered this movie used, but it didn't matter. It was in good condition and far less expensive than buying it new. A good movie, but I liked the 2nd one better. We'll see what the 3rd one has to offer..."
2,"An awesome Rock N' Roll album, from a great band!!","""Be Here Now"" is for sure the best Oasis album. It has their greatest songs, and it shows how well they can make music.When I bought this CD I wasn't sure if I was going to like, but after I listened to songs like ""D'You Know What I Mean?"", ""All Around The World"", ""Stand By Me"", and the title track ""Be Here Now"", I saw that once again Oasis did a great job!!"
1,Miscast Actress Playing Emma Is Too Old!,Anyone who knows the book knows that Emma is susposed to be about 20 years old so why do they have an acress playing her that looks like she's between 40 to 45 years old?Isn't this actress in this 70's BBC made version a little too long in the tooth to be playing a young woman in her early 20's?Buy or rent the Gwyneth Paltrow or Kate Beckensale versions instead. They act good in their versions and are young enough to be believable as Emma.PS: The guy playing Knightley in this movie is too old too.Jeremy Northam and Mark Strong are way better Knightleys.
1,A Lame Ghost Wannabe,"Very sad. If you must, rent the ORIGINAL Haunting--a very good flick. This film suffers from the Hollywood mentality: that special effects and big name actors can rescue a weak plot. Was there a single scare in the film? No. Was the ending telegraphed right from the start? Yes. CGI spirits do not make for chills."
1,Great But?,"This is a great printer for any use up to 8X10 photo production. The ""But"" in the review is the cost of ink and the fact that it uses a single cartridge. I run out of one color ink even with it set to a lighter setting in the printing menu and I am out of luck. The rest is wasted. The two sided printing is great ...particuclary with all these programs now having the 'manual' on the CD to print...."
2,It's great.,"This is the great and very interesting book to read.So for your great experience, pls. try it as soon. :-)"
1,Dark is right!,"A fan of Rinaldi, I was looking forward to reading this book. The original plot was set up well, but as I read on it became more gruesome and frightening with every page. Its title says it all: the book is just plain dark. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone not in for a horror story. Dead bodies, detailed accounts of hangings, nightmares, and assasinations are not what I look forward to in Ann Rinaldi's books."
2,Cheap and works really well!,"Bought a pair of these after reading about a little DIY someone did with the SonySony SS-B3000 Bookshelf Speakers (Pair, Black)and adding a crossover to them. Was an incredibly straight forward install and so far I'm really pleased with the noticeably richer sound I'm getting. I'm a college student on a budget which is why I went with the Sony's in the first place but these cross overs definitely stayed in budget and were worth the purchase.I was contemplating making my own cross over but gave in to the simplicity.Also wanted to note that these shipped very quickly, arrived 3 days after ordering and they made a very far journey."
2,MISS JANET...SHOULD I SAY MORE?!!!,"I TAPED THE SHOW THE NIGHT IT AIRED WHILE IT WAS TAPING I WAS AT THE SHOW, TOO HOT, MISS JANET TORE IT UP. EVERYONE WAS SINGING WITH HER. IT WAS SO LOUD, SOMETIMES YOU COULD HARDLY HEAR IT, BUSTA WAS THERE, T-BOZ, AMONG ALOT OF CELEBS WHO WERE THERE, LISTEN, ENOUGH WITH THE TALK, JANET IS TOO FIERCE, GET THE TAPE, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED."
1,Dated,"I borrowed this video from the local library. The video could be used to teach beginners to classic cross-country ski provided there was an experienced instructor doing narration, otherwise you may put the class to sleep. The footage consists of long and repeated shots of a single skier traditional skiing, to soft almost hypnotic music in the background. The video is somewhat dated in its technique, equipment and filmmaking, and would be hard pressed to compete with modern videos the likes of Warren Miller (Alpine), Christian Begin (Mtn Biking) or xczone (cross-country skiing)."
1,Under the tuscan sun,to be honest I expected a little more from the movie. it was too mellow and somewhat boring.
2,it was good i dont see the problem,it was different and maybe not her best but it was still good. i mean it did have soulmates in and we got to see ash again which gains any book about three stares however short a time its for. i hope as is in the last book
2,Great book by Great Guru,"In my college days ,i found Edward D gaughan's 'Introduction to Analysis',amidst pile of other books.I read the preface countless times.With his words of encouragement and admonishment ,writer makes you more comfortable ,in your long journey of Mathematics which is real and abstract at once!! I liked this book;After a decade still i fondly remember this book !!I recommend this book whole heartedly, to any one who is sincere in his approach and wants to become first rate mathematician."
2,"Simple, quick, and fun","I loved how this game had number concepts that were beyond just counting skills for young children.I also loved the simple and quick charm that the game had, which reminded me of the games I played as a child. I'm in my 20s and I think this game would be great for when my friends and I want soething to do, but don't want to explain the hard and long rules of the games marketed to our age group."
2,Good Buy,"It isn't the best movie in the world, but it is definitely one that should be watched in HD with Surround Sound. It is a must for my library."
2,Really good.,"When I bought this anime, I thought that is would be good but not excellent. After I finished watching it, I realized that this was one of the better animes that I have watched in a while. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that it was only like an hour long and it would have been a lot better if they spread this anme out into 2 hours instead. I hope that they come out wth a sequel!"
1,"Great plot, horrible writing!!!!!!!!","I believe that the plot of ""The Scarlet Letter"" could have been wonderful & something I would love to read, because the events are all such interesting ideas. I just think that Mr. Hawthorne made them boring through his writing style. Sometimes it just dragged on forever & I really think more of the book consisted of descriptions than dialogue---I couldn't enjoy a book like that. I think if this was written by a different author, with mainly the same plot, it could be wonderful. But this, was terribly boring!!!!!!!!"
2,the best music for the best videogame,"This Cd contains every track you hear in the video game. If you liked the game, you'll love this cd, just to hear it is like playing the game all over again. A MUST HAVE FOR ZELDA FANS."
2,Not appropriate for 16 month old - see update,"The pegs and the pictures do not match at all. So, the child has to count the objects in the space of the number and then find the corresponding number. Notice in the picture that they are not even the same color. So if your child does not recognize numbers yet then this puzzle will not work. I know the manufacturer recommends 24 month age but my son is doing other 24 month puzzles already. I'm sure it will be challenging in a few months as he approaches 2 years of age and/or he learns to count. The 6 and the 9 are similar but not interchangeble.update: I stand corrected! My almost 18 month is doing this puzzle and loves it. I do not give enough credit to the clever little brains. He can see the shape and match the shape to the puzzle piece. Amazing. They just seemed so similar to me but I was wrong. 5 star puzzle. . . ."
2,Works like a charm,"When we converted over to Time-Warner digital phone service, we could no longer connect via the wireless modem jack. so, we hooked this up to our Linksys WRT-300N Wireless Broadband Router and it works like a charm updating Tivo all the time plus a bunch of extras. Good Price (less than the Tivo website)& quick delivery."
2,19th Century Views For Today,"This is an interesting book which will give you a lot of insight into daily life in the 19th century. There is a lot that is outdated in terms of daily living, education and of course technology. However, there are some gems in this book. For instance, she talks about how she helped her corns on her foot by placing a cut cranberry on them. She also recommends a raw onion for a wasp sting.For anyone interested in historical views, there are sections on raising daughters, how to deal with poverty and philosophy about travel."
1,Colombian family values -- part II,"Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what *may* be an atypical Colombian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilections.And speaking of predilections, Marquez, along with some other of intellectualdom's best and brightest, recently decided to weigh in on the Klinton-Lewinsky scandal (New York Times, Sep 26, 1998). I think this is entirely appropriate. When it comes to judging contemporary sexual mores, who better than Marquez to judge our beloved Bill?"
2,Batcave a good buy!,My boys got this for their birthday and I put it together the night before. It is quite large and impressive and my boys' friends found it their most impressive present. One friend thought it was the neatest toy he had ever seen. My sons actaually spent more time playing with their Justice League Watch Tower but this toy was next most popular. They already had all the Batman and sidekicks action figures to go with it so it worked out perfect. My sons still play with it every day. Well worth the money.
1,spend the additional money and get an MK,"My main complaint is the fence, getting both sides square to the blade and locked down will take you about five minute's and even then don't put to much pressure on the fence as it will ether bow or one side will move. An MK is much faster put the tile on the carriage push the tile to the blade make sure the kurf is going to be on the correct side of your mark slide the carriage back set the fence (if you'd like) turn the saw on and cut. I renovate older home and many times the walls are out of square so your cut tiles are going to be getting bigger or smaller as you go God help you if you get into this position with the Plasplugs tile saw...."
1,Digital copy is expired,Digital copy expired 2 months ago so unable to put it on ipad. Would not have bought if i knew the digital copy wasnt included
2,The impact is enormous!,"This book was magnificent. I started it knowing how it would end, yet I was still close to tears when I put down this wonderful book. A wonderful book for someone who wants to read an amazing classic, yet doesn't want to have to spend four or five months reading it."
1,moonstruck,"This title, Moonstruck (BlueRay) is not widescreen , as advertised, nor are there any special features. Amazon's return policy is quite cumbersome, so I didn't bother to return it assuming a replacement would be the same. Things such as this are becoming more common with Amazon as is my dissatisfaction. They could easily lose this customer who makes about 100 purchases a year."
1,Too difficult,"For trying to be a popular exposition on mathematics Devlin's book is too difficult for the lay reader. Unless you have university level mathematics in your luggage you won't understand much. The explanations of basic conepts are missing, the proofs are not there and the history is condensed into a few pages. Thus if your mathematical imagination cannot fill in these gaps you will not extract much pleasure from this book. You will rather be frustrated. I myself have read mathematics at the university and still couldn't follow him everywhere. The problem is that the labeling of the book is misleading. This is not a book of popularized mathematics. This is leizure time reading for mathematics professors and math-freaks. If you want to read something that is easy to understand but still interesting try some of the American Mathematical Society's wonderful publications (you can find them all on amazon)."
2,Excellent SciFi Crime Drama,"A large percentage of the book is from the Lisa's point of view, a young girl on the brink of puberty, but this is not a young adult book. It has none of the typical angst you often see in today's teen characters. There is no romance. A Coming of Age is more like a SciFi Crime Drama, a mystery set on another planet with twists and turns so complex I was always on the edge of my seat.One thing I found refreshing was the lack of over-explanation. Zahn left it up to his readers to interpret subtle clues about the plot and alien terminology from the context. I felt like a grown-up, reading a book that gave me a chance to flex my brain.I don't say this often, but this book would make an exceptional film!"
1,Trash CD...,"Dont buy this album, its a bootleg [Unofficial] CD. Tatu will not recieve a dime from the sales of this CD."
1,Tivo set up,"I'm so sorry that I couldn't use this product. I'm not very good on the computer end and didn't realize that this product would not work with the new ""black box"" and digital tuner etc. Still don't understand it completely, but the technician that came to my house to set it all up said I couldn't use it. With this new system coming upon us I feel that when things that won't work on your old TV should state that it would be obsolete after a few weeks. I'm a senior and had no idea that this would or could happen. However, the service and cooperation of all was superb. The customer from whom I dealt with was so friendly and helpful and gracious as well as Amazon themselves. No complaints!!! Just think for us who haven't the knowledge the obsolete items should be marked. Something of that importance needs to be known. I truly have no idea on how or if this product works. It was rated very high when I bought it, but for me it didn't rate at all. Thank you !!!!"
1,"Comfortable, but leaked the first night","it inflated easily and was very firm, by the morning i noticed it was considerably softer, and as i sit here now typing this i find myself gradually getting closer to the floor. easy enough to reinflate, but still, this should not happen the first night."
1,CD Fahrenheit 451,"I marked one star only because I cannot give it anything lower. I placed this order on Jan. 10. Time to get the order came and went. Here it is Feb. 7, and I still do not have the CD of Fahrenheit 451. Is this company located on the moon? Why is it taking SO long for my order to get here? I am MOST displeased. I will never order anything from this company CheapBks4U again. This service is atrocious."
2,Exciting read,I really have enjoyed this book for it's amazing details that bring the listed bible scriptures to life. The research that was used makes it more credible as I also go back and read those verses in my own bible.
1,Don't waste your hard-earned money,"This book is an absolute waste of money. I have more than three years of programming experience in procedural languages like COBOL. I am familiar with C. I am familiar with basic OO concepts. I thought I was an intelligent and competent programmer. This book did its best to destroy my confidence.To be frank: this is the worst programming book I have ever come across. It gives you half baked ideas, and keeps them that way. Before a concept is fully grasped, the author goes on to say something else in an equally vague manner. If you can find even one single concept clearly explained in this book, you are lucky.Bottomline: This book is great for you if your ambition is to drop a few heavy-sounding technical terms in a gathering of programmers who are not so comfortable with Java. If your ambition is to learn and master a new language from scratch, look elsewhere.P.S. The sale of this book is a classic example of what media hype can do."
1,SIGNATURE STYLE,"I found this book to be extremely boring. While the pictures were done well, the content was way too traditional and museum-like. The rooms didn't look like anyone could live in them, and that the furniture ought to be slipcovered in plastic like some of our Grandparents homes."
1,Way Overrated,"Pretty dumb, unrealistic, and not scary at all. In comparison just shows how great, realistic and well made The Exorcist is."
1,You have got to be kidding,"The book was pretty well written, but is typical in that the conservatives are the evil ones and the liberals are the good guys. How tiresome that plotline is!! But the unforgivable sin is the third secret. It is just plain stupid. Any one who knows anything about Catholicism will just laugh off the third secret. It is just wishful thinking by people who want their Catholicism in the cafeteria style. I stopped reading it after that."
1,They are the has beens and wanna bees,"hmmm...just think....Noel, a brilliant man, maKING A CD that is just crap. What happened!!!!! I can't believe it....over played solos....awful lryics!!!!! Just when you think they could make another brilliant album, they make a crappy album. Haaa...just think.... 4 yrs ago Blur was being called the has beens because Oasis brokoe the US but blur did not. Well....who are the has beens now??? Well Oasis... all I cam say is RETIRE!!!! Geesh, for Beatle wanna bees, I would expect better."
1,A disappointment,"Having heard the author speak on the radio, her works praised highly by the host, I decided to start with the first of the Monk series. Unfortunately, I found the main character thoroughly unsympathetic and unlikable. The story was slow as molasses with bits and pieces of useless information thrown in to fatten the book. Also, I don't know the clinical features of amnesia, but it seemed that Monk's memory loss was selective and inconsistent. The ending was highly anti-climactic and the fate of the characters in question never revealed. I was very much looking forward to reading her books, but was sorely disappointed."
1,Disappointing!,"This looked so cool, I thought my kids would love it. But the gum base is impossible to stir - you need to nuke it for way longer than it says to and then it hardens up and is impossible to work with. It becomes hard and brittle rather than smooth and workable. Save your money and don't bother with this! My kids were totally disappointed!"
2,Horrible!,"Man this game is horrible! I mean, the graphics are pretty good, but the fighting mode is terrible. First Frodo attacks and most likely misses! And in the Mines of Moria, there is a huge glitch. I got past it, but there is another one! This game stinks!!"
1,Somewhat outdated,"This book was published in 1987 and reprinted in 1994. The book does recognize that it is really when the MIDI-instruments are connected to a computer that MIDI takes on its real power, but only 10% of the book talks about MIDI and computers. The chapter on computer tells you about the choice between PC, MAC, Atrari and Commodore, and explains in length what a CD-rom is, and why we need it (not all programs fit on a floppy disk...) Sequencer program are mentioned, but barely so.The book does a fair job in explaining the MIDI standard and how it works, but it does not help me at all when I want to get started in connecting the components to my PC. I do think this was an excellent book in 1987, but digital music has moved on a long way since then."
1,Level 2 NOC tech,"its is unclear rather this really works with G4 Powerbook. the connector that plugs in to the powerbook fits , but the connection itself is unstable and easily disrupted by just a little wiggle or touch of the cable or connector. If you are looking for a replacement cable go with Apple branded. that one works ."
2,Cat treat,"Our cat acts more like a dog every day. Whenever the dog gets a treat, our cat also begs for a treat. The combination of catnip and seafood is perfect."
2,The pleasure of ethical paradox,"Social satire has ever been an interesting and delightful way to discover and examine the basics of human behaviour and believing, both to show the weakness of logic and the strength of hypocrisy of many rules and customs. Butler, in his novel, developes this theme as a XIX century writer can do. The result is a pleasing reading, made a bit difficult by a slightly obsolete style and too much care of details, which sometimes gives some obstacles to thread. An example of how, about half a century later, a writer could have faced the same subject is given by new world by Huxley. The book is nonetherless quite readable, and an example of the high level tradition in which Butler can stand together with Swift."
2,Hidden Gem!!,"After listening to tracks off this CD on KKSF in San Francisco 15 years ago, I decided to search high and low for one of the last albums on the Columbia label by the jazz piano legend. I finally found a used version in a second hand book store for 5 bucks! It was worth the wait. ""My Love Leads You Home"" & ""Shamballa"" are the highlights on this 7 track CD, which I wish could have been longer. To this day, Ramsey Lewis continues to entertain and gives us a hard to find treasure!Buy it if you can find it!!"
2,Truly and excellent book.,"Actually, I rate this an 11. This was the first, and the fifth, and the last Clavell novel that I have read (yes, I read it three times). Clavell even coproduced an excellent movie adaptation in the late 60's (though filmed purposely in black and white) which captured the entire mood of the book. The reason that this book works so well is that Clavell himself lived the story. The character of Peter Marlowe is based on Clavell himself, and it shows.This book is a brutal, depressing display of humanity at its basest. Not for the light hearted, but a must for anyone interested in WWII or in Asia."
1,utterly unbelievable,"Expecting a decent read, I was severely disappointed as I have read other Belva Plain books. The character of Hyacinth is totally unbelievable. How can a person live in this world and be so utterly ignorant of what real life is? The further I got into the story, the more incredulous and indignant I became. She allowed her husband to victimize her. Yes, he was despicable but she took it all. If this woman loved her children and wanted them with her as much as she claimed, she would have at least pursued some kind of second opinion, confidential consultation, something! And what about any true and lasting remorse expressed for the accidental death? She only expresses fear of spending time in jail. The woman exists in a complete cocoon. How sympathetic is that for a character? Spare yourself this book."
2,real life hero,just as good now as when i bought the album when it first came out. good diversity in the music. This album was originally thought to be the Beatles reformed.
1,Not a good movie at all...stinks!!!,"Well the critics got this one right; Michael Bay was a good director until he got big and lost his perspective. Dirty old man syndrome? Yes, what a joke. I was looking forward to intelligent Sci-Fi and got crap. The reference to Obama in an unreal world was stupid (I came to get away from real world politics). The treatment of the woman in the movie was degrading (glad the other actress bowed out...what a tear down}. It was a shame that the very good actors that came back to do this film had to deal with a totally self-involved director. The animation was excellent but the story was trash. I am soo sorry I spent any money on this film."
2,This book revolutionized the way I look at myself,"I finally understand why I've always felt different and like an outcast and I've learned to accept the things about me that are ""different."" I never knew so many things I thought were ""wrong"" with me were commonalities to being gifted. Now that I know, I recognize it in my friends and students and I finally have a structured way to improve how I communicate and interact with ""normal"" people. I highly recommend this book for anyone who's smart and feels like they don't fit in."
1,this is the worst book i have ever read!!!!*-,"1984 is the worst book I have ever read. I would advise anyone who is thinking about reading this book to reconcider! George Orwell is not a bad writer, however, this book he does not do evry well on, as some of his others. Prehaps he was getting old and lost his touch. Animal Farm was okay, but 1984 was horrible. It took him forever, it seemed like, to get into the accual book. If someone were to take out all of the useless part of 1984, it would be half as long. Why would he wirte so much about nothing? I havent ever meet someone who could wirte such a boring book about the goverment. I have meet many people who have loved this book, but i dispised it. I am not at all intrested in the goverment. This may be part of the reason that I didnt like it. I would advise you not to read this book."
1,Do not order this part from RitzCamera,I ordered Panasonic 1GB Secure Digital (SD) Card ( RPSDH01GU1A )Which is a 66x speed (10BM/s)I received RP-SDQ01G which is 33X speed (5MB/s). Ritzcamera will cheat you. You can find the part they sent me for $20 less on Amazon with free shipping.

1,Wasted Talent,"Here is a guy with an exceptional voice. What is he doing singing boring, emotionless music that could be sung by countless no talent others on the BMG label. I hope the guys at BMG can rent David Foster to help Clay to get it right next time. Clay could be as good as Michael Buble or Gosh Groban if only he had someone who could bring out his incredbile voice."
1,Blurred Audio,"Audio is technically flawed. The instumental sounds are Not crisp and clear. The musical selections and the Ellington orchestration are excellent. But the unclear Audio makes listening to this album like viewing a blurred, out of focus photograph. Definitely NOT a worthwhile selection for serious Duke Ellington afficionados."
2,Flea control,"This is a great product and I have used it for years. It is a part of flea control and should not be expected to be the one answer for every flea. Pets need to have flea medicine/baths as well as continuous vacuuming of the house since fleas can live on pet hair. A flea cycle is 21 days-using this product in a combination with proper flea control is the best way to get the maximum performance. Spray where pet sleeps, all carpets, furniture, area rugs, and fabrics where fleas can lay eggs. Keep it up once a week or more for the first 3 weeks to break the flea cycle while applying flea medication to your pets. Humans can carry fleas into the house as well as pets. The trick is to stay on top of the flea cycle so it doesn't become out of hand. If it is allowed to go through a few cycles without proper flea control, it will take much more effort, time, and products to get it under control."
2,Great Deal - Great Fit,"Exactly as advertised the famous Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Sneaker is a great buy! Looks great, fits great and is super comfortable. I highly recommend it!"
2,It's my favorite book about 5 years,"There are many funy things about money, wishes and so on. I smile every time when read their. When I have some problem in my life I get this book and read from any place I opened the book. And all the time I start to feel better."
1,clay has done better,I like clay. But I was not to thrill with this cd. Rueben seem to be more impressive
2,great!,"perfect for my using to froth milk for my morning coffee, or my after dinner decaf! Love it! Would purchase again."
1,sorry....,"Sorry, I couldn't get into this one at all. If you want to read some GOOD thrillers located in Bangkok, try John Burdett's books beginning with Bangkok 8."
2,Wife Follows it like the Bible,"We were wanted to try and sleep train our daughter so that we could get some sleep, she found this book and decided to try it. Lo and behold, it worked, our daughter is now 19 months and she sleeps on her own and sleeps through the night and this has been going on since she was 5 months, so for us it works, it was a little tough at first and she cried and we would not go her but over the long run it works. Highly recommend, if anything for your sanity."
2,Great Book,This book is really helpful for learning about color theory. Its technical but really interesting so you can get through it easily.
1,"Didn't Work, Period","I read several of the reviews before buying and kept in mind several of the recommendations. I actually ordered 2 thinking to give one as a stocking stuffer and keep one for myself. I tried the first one and it basically didn't work from the get go (broken I guess). So didn't give the other one as a gift, kept it (didn't want to give a bad gift). Finally got around to trying the second one out... put a steaming cup of hot tea on it, probably drank half the cup pretty quickly but the second half sat there for quite a while and when I went to drink it, COLD. I hate to say it but I would not recommend it."
2,Great watch...,"I ordered this watch back in 2006. I wore it every day for the last 6 years and it had many hours in the pool/water and close to 100 dives on it, with one dive as deep as 137 feet back in 2008. Awesome watch. However, the last time I took it in to have the battery changed, the jeweler (I guess) didn't put it back together correctly and it flooded 2 weeks ago. So, it is no longer working. Although I did love this watch and it's smaller size (I'm not a large male with big wrists) I am going to purchase an automatic watch this time so I don't have rely on jewelers to change out the battery."
2,Mystery galore!,"How can a film be this good? You are in thrall for the entire running time, pulled right into the house with them. Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier are on target and the supporting cast is stellar, as well."
2,Perfect for a first grader,great for a child just learning basic math concepts. has really helped my first grader gain an edge with math facts
2,This is a good book,"I am a sixth and I'm reading a book about five teenagers who died in the Holocaust. the first diary is about a teenager named David Rubinowicz and his diary is called ""The end of the world will soon be here"".Yitzak Rubasheuski is the second diary of the book and his diary is called ""Long live the youth!"" Moshe Flinker is the third of this book and his diary is called ""My name is Harry"". Eva Heyan's is the fourth diary and her diary is called ""I want to live!""Ann frank is the last diary of the book and her diary is called ""I must uphold my Ideals"". The reason I didn't wright anything about what happened is because I don't want to spoil the story for you. I liked this book because of the detials. The only bad part is that all the teenagers died."
2,Awesome baby prunes!,My daughter loves these! The only thing I wish they would change would be to make the package recyclable.
2,The best eye gel I've ever used!!,"I have been using this eye gel for a few years now and while I am approaching 50, my eyes sure don't look it!"
2,Fantastic shoes,"I think these are possibly the best shoes I own! I don't know how people have such a problem with them. The leather is soft and doesn't rub anywhere at all. I'm so picky about shoes and have no tolerance for ""breaking them in"". These required none of that. I'm on my feet for 7 to 8 hours a day, every day, and wear these almost constantly. Yea, they're not big on arch support, but they're ballet flats, which never have arch support. Relatively speaking, these are pretty good in that department. Cute with pants, jeans, or casual skirts. Perfect shoes - at any price!"
1,Is there oregano in this product?,"Have tried the more expensive product from North American and it cleared up mine and my husband's stuffy noses within 24 hrs. Occasionally you would get a slight after burp with that product. With this product, I've been taking for a week and I still have a stuffy nose and never an after burp. Plus the capsules are huge compared to p73."
2,A Charlie Brown Christmas Is Very Good!,Like other reviewers I also grew up watching A Charlie Brown Christmas when CBS showed it every December and I liked every minute of it including the heartwarming speech by Linus about the true meaning of Christmas and I think this is a great Christmas cartoon but I was disappointed with the extra feature cartoon It's Christmas Time Again Charlie Brown because It was very uneven and choppy!
2,One of Heinlein's better Children's Stories,"This book is an excellent adventure in the Heinlein series. He once again creates a captivating set of charecters that drwas the auidence in. The story is set in space, as the main charecter is attempting to become a part of the elite space patrol. It is a story about duty, honor, and becoming a man with responsibility"
1,Save your money,"I wouldn't bother with this one. Although I am a big fan of LPs guide books, this phrase-book was not particularly helpful. 9 times out of 10 they didn't have what I was looking for and when they did it was a real hassle to find. The pronunciation guide was not that helpful but the food section was good. If you already have the guidebook you could probably get by w/out this, but if you feel you need something, get a used copy over there(or maybe an Amazon auction.) If you do get fed up with it (as I did), it makes a very nice gift for a Thai friend. Next time I'll bring a pocket dictionary. Hope this helped."
1,Remember: there's no DRANO for the brain-o (beware!),"If you want a sick, disgusting, perverse movie, look no further. You've found it.One word: Feh!In NIGHT TRAIN TO TERROR, glum Jehovah and amused Beelzebub sit opposite each other in a train's dining booth. Three repulsive stories are presented in-between performances from an early-Madonna influenced pop band, complete with breakdancing vocalist. Ancient spectral black conductor and porter inexplicaby shuffle between cars. Visuals in the first segment alone include lobotomy, amputation, heads preserved in jars of formaldehyde and hanging body parts. Lots of booby shots for ogling snuff perves. (grabs some filth-removing eyewash)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(2.7) Night Train to Terror (1985) - Richard Moll/Cameron Mitchell/John Phillip Law/Marc Lawrence/Ferdy Mayne/Tony Giorgio/Earl Washington/Gabriel Whitehouse"
2,Very good,"I've been around a while and sometimes certain hardcore bands can seem a bit distant for me to relate to. This band however, is not the case. Good, fast, packed with emotion hardcore. Get all the Champion stuff. It's worth it."
2,Classic Fantastic Sci-Fi,"I know the book/series is dated, but it's still a terrific read. This man was so far ahead of his time in imagination and futuristic ideas. I read many of his books as a kid and it has been a treat to read this one again. The chivalry and romance and epic adventure is classic even if the ""science"" is entirely BS. Burroughs' prose makes you long to know what happens next. Can't wait to read more!"
2,Shoo Goo,We always use this to support shoes that we love. Glad to still find it somewhere. The price is also right
1,Pretty bad,"This game is only for kids and if you play the game for a while you will get bored unless you are usually the age of 8 or under. The game is cute. I'm not looking for cute games. I mean shooting water, getting slimed, and doing a food fight is for kids. When you buy it, you will only like the games for probably like the game for 3 days unless you are a big Nickelodeon freak."
2,Great!,This is my fourth-grade son's favorite book. He loves cooking and this book is fun with great recipes.
1,SO Disappointing,"A great voice impeded by dreadful songs, most written by a committee (it seems) and humdrum orchestration. Clay, please listen to GREAT songs by the master songwriters -- Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, so many others. You have the voice. Please find the music."
2,Wow - not hating Steinbeck,"I've always made a big deal about how much I do not like Steinbeck or Hemingway, but after reading a couple of both of theirs this year, I have to admit that I LOVE both. As far as Steinbeck, I know that I still despise The Grapes of Wrath, but this is an incredible book. Especially short and easy to read, the writing is simply superb. The characters are well-developed, the dialogue is simple and to the point, and the descriptions are detailed. This book deserves it's frequent consideration as a classic. And while I still can't imagine ever liking GOW, I can no longer dismiss Steinbeck."
2,The purest novel describing the human condition.,"This is not a happy book as many other readers have said in their reviews. It is a novel of depression and introspection showing both the saddest and brighest sides of solitude. But the characters' solitude is not like me locking myself up in my room to read this book. It is deeper, describing something existential, a way of life that is disciplined in the joyous festivities and in the deep mourning. My lasting impression of this book is not that of beauty or wonder, but shock in the speaker's accurate description of the human condition."
2,The best Batman of the three with Christian Bale,This is much better than The Dark Night or the Dark Night Rises. Bales role in Batman Begins was outstanding. It really shows the dark side of Batman and makes it believable. The next two were more corny and seemed to focus more on the effects and not the story.
2,The best of SG-1,"This is a great episode. It was good to see Don Davis as General George Hammond for the last time. It was a parade of many loved characters, though Braytac and Dr. Fraiser were missing. I love the alternate universe stories and this was just as good. I definitely recommend this for anyone who likes Star Gate."
2,Read this book,"Amazingly written!! Ray Bradbury is a visionary. The book was intriguing, and suspenseful. When I read it I couldn't put it down!"
1,waste off money,"this is not waterproof.its GARBAGE where batteries go in broke,while trying to adj.DO NOT BUY.you turn the end to control it,that loosens the battery cover where water gets in so how is it waterproff?????"
1,:0( BOOO!,"first the acting was so so so bad the movie, this is what i have to say ?but they get E for effort."
1,VERY limited lifespan,"I loved this when I first started using it and recommended it to everyone -- but after very limited use, it was totally shot. Either the keys didn't respond at all or if you pressed one key, multiple letters appeared (""a"" became ""as""; ""q"" became ""qw"") and it was impossible to return. One friend who also purchased it had exactly the same problem within a month, so it wasn't just a bad unit.If I coud give it NO stars, I would."
2,Loooove it!,"Had the cassette when I was 16, missed having it and had the chance to purchase it again. Fast shipping, great condition, just love it!"
2,Good buy!,This brush reaches where it is intended to reach and is well made. It is exactly what I was looking for.
1,"Zombie Lover or Sex,Sex,Sex","This is the worst of the Xanth novel, that I have read. I was greatly disappointed in the emphasis on sex. This book seemed to be written for the politically correct, morally lost society member. Piers Anthony did his Xanth fan's a disservce with this novel. Also take note of the cover picture, a small peite ""white girl"" and a zombie, well part of that is in the story. Why was the cover misleading, possibly to sell this trashy novel. Save your money, don't buy this book."
1,Cinderella in the South,"This story is more than a little farfetched -- quirky unlicensed but sought-after physician grandmother enlightened enough (in the U.S. South, in the 1940s and 1950s) to give abortions and do CPR on colored folk -- silly mom -- plain young girl who has no exposure to males in any form or at any age, who suddenly falls in love with a rich privileged handsome guy with curable war wounds. It instantly blended into a dozen or so such chick-lit feel-good southern stories I've read over the past decade or so, and like them left not a trace on my brain or imagination."
2,Conversation Piece,Thought this would be a great coffee table book at my place in Myrtle Beach. Was in good shape as described.
1,junk,"this thing is nothing but s piece of junk it came broke,didnt,work i wouldnt of rated it but i had to:[DO NOT BUY THIS ITEAM-it is nothing but a piece of junk"
2,Magnifico libro,"Brian Weiss ha dejado una magnifica guia para quienes no tienen mucha informacion acerca del Hipnotismo, La historia de Katerine es tan impresionante que podria ayudar a culquier persona que se ha hecho la pregunta mas de una vez sobre la continuidad de la vida."
1,Not a Masterpiece.,"First off it was made by a Perv, Second it is creepy with everybody in on it type of thing, and it's representative of the era and Hollywood's Obsession with The Bizarre and Plain dumb. Masterpiece? NO."
2,Adds new fun to the track,"The mechanical switches are a wonderful way to add new fun to my son's Brio track. It seems easy for him to operate the switches and it adds a new dimension to his layouts since he now can redirect trains as they move about. They are a little pricey, but appear durable and well worth it."
2,A masterpiece,"My favorite Garcia-Marquez title, and one of my favorite booksever. What a treat this book was to read. I remembergetting to the ending, and about 10 pages from the finishstarting to cry uncontrollably, and not stopping until longafter the book was done. A true work of beauty."
2,Nearly Sanders Best,"It took a while to get into this cd. Though I often admire Bill Laswell, sessions that he produces are often terribly uneven (except Sharrock's Ask the Ages where he basically lets the music do the talking). The title track starts with an ""ambient"" percussion section that makes you want to say ""laswell is a genius."" This is followed by an ""afro-pop"" song/rap that makes you want to say ""why does Laswell have to mess with everything."" The problem today is, everybody thinks you have to fill up a whole CD with music. Try programing this disc without the ""smooth jazz"" Midnight in berkely and the title track and I believe you will find this could have been Pharoah's best album and it still clocks in at about 50 minutes."
2,Great movie,I think this is a lost David Lean treasure and it is one of Mitchum's finest works. He was a really good actor and I am glad this movie is showing up again and getting good reviews. I think the academa award going to John Mills was a BIG mistake his performance does not hold up over the years. There is a fun book you should get that explains all the complications that went on with the making of this movie that should be included with the DVD
2,Interesting...very interesting.,"It may not have the most complicated, interwoven plot, but what can I say, I like it. Kit fits fits perfectly into the time period without becoming one of those overly sugary ""porceline dolls"" which is what happens to many of the characters in all kinds of historical fiction because the author is not quite sure how the characters of the past should react. It's interesting to watch as Kit tries to fit into her surroundings, but then finds out she can't. She is who she is, and would be who she is. So soon she learns a way out of the suffering of being different but has another problem--her unique character and ""evil"" way of dressing lead the people of her town to believe she's a witch. Now she must rely one the people she trusts most to save her, and hope that some of the people she found hopelessly mistrustful of her would find a way to forgive for being different."
2,Electrifying Jams,"Jiggle's last studio album, ""In It Again"" is a totally different animal than this new live disc. The studio album concentrates on the songs, whereas ""Live at the Stone Coast Brewery"" is all about the jam and great improvisation. Each song packs a punch. There is great guitar and organ work throughout the album, backed by a grooving and very solid rhythm section. Highlights include a great extended vocal jam, too. Overall, this album is a must have for lovers of jam-rock, improvisation, or just all around fun music!"
1,Bluetooth,This Bluetooth does not work that well. It seems to understand my commands only part of the time. I will opt to buy a more expensive one with noise reduction too.
2,I really enjoy the series.,"Ever since I read Clan of the Cave bear and its sequel The Valley of Horses, I have been looking for books just like it. If i were you, i would rush to the bookstore or the library and get it. Don't wait. Its a good book."
1,Berberich's exagerations do a disservice to readers,"He makes the process even scarier than it already needs to be. He exagerates. For instance, he describes the pain of the biopsy as horrible. Having just had one, I can say the pain was not noteworthy.He goes to a hundred doctors to determine his course of action. Doesn't that, by itself, show he's at least a little bit crazy?"
1,You cannot make sushi with rice made from this rice cooker.,The quality of rice is inadequate to satisfy anyone who likes sushi. I am really surprised that Sanyo makes such bad quality product. I returned the product.
2,Great CD!,Prison Song - 10/10Needles - 9/10Deer Dance - 10/10Jet Pilot - 9/10X - 9/10Chop Suey! - 10/10Bounce - 8/10Forest - 8/10Atwa - 9/10Science - 8/10Shimmy - 8/10Toxicity - 9/10Psycho - 8/10Aerials - 10/10
2,Solid product!,"I had the reported switching problem (""UPDATE: This device has one annoying defect ... a ""clever"" feature of switching inputs automatically when it senses no input on one of the two stereo inputs ... any stretch of silence will cause it to switch""). I called AudioSource and I have to give them credit. The problem is relatively easy to solve by using Input 2 instead of Input 1 if you're only using one input."
1,"Boring, One Sided, Inaccurate","My review title pretty much says it all.One sided books are fine if not disguised. This book has an agenda, anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Facts contained are presented with all the reasons one should be anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Many facts aren't fact, like the statement that Asda took over J Sainsbury's in 2003 - didn't happen.As the world's largest and most successful retailer there are many more interesting books about Wal-Mart. Fine if you're anti Wal-Mart or pro union.......but don't preach, make a book, let me decide!"
1,"Pretty sad, fake pictures and nearly all adds.","Fake airbushed pictures, ie Andy Roddick. That guys arms turned out bigger than his waist. This magazine used to be okay. I think they spend more time with tanning, lights, make-up and Photoshop that they do with real athletes. If they cut out the ""4-page advertisements"" every 6 pages along with all the adds at back of the magazine it would consist of the cover and a 1/2 page article. They should pay people to accept it in the mail, hard to charge for a brochure. I just wish it was more ""real"" and less about selling us on smelling like roses and wearing $350 desinger shoes, cater to the average Joe who just wants to get good info and work-out ideas. I could watch QVC and MTV to cover any lack of B.S. I may be experiencing. Your best bet is to just surf the net, buy books, save your money."
2,Works Great!,"I had a Linksys wireless receiver that was not compatible with Vista, so after upgrading my computer, I found this on Amazon and based on reviews, decided to give it a shot. Worked wonderful right out of the box, and signal strength is excellent! Works like a champ, and easy to install. Highly recommend if you need a Vista compatible connection to your wireless router."
2,5 stars for michael pitt!,i love michael pitt and appreciate that i found this movie here to add to my collection. disc in good conditon and delivered promptly =)
2,"creative, interesting approach to Greece","I like the mainstream of travel books, but I've never seen one designed quite this way. The author has woven a plain-language retelling of parts of Homer with descriptions of the modern Greeks as he came to know them. Fair play to the author: he has given us something refreshingly different.Lundgren writes clear, quality prose with above average descriptive talent. His deep affection for his subject is evident throughout, which warmed my heart as it deviates from the accepted journalistic principle (one I despise) of pretending to have no real human feelings. I tend to believe that a traveler learns more about a people when s/he tends to like them, and the author clearly does.Recommended for the travel reader willing to try a novel approach to the subject of culture study. For the travel reader with any interest at all in Homer, feel free to add a star."
2,Great combination for camping...,I recently took this on my last camping trip. Realizing that the light would be more useful than the fan. Where I was camping the nights were cold and the fan was not necessary. What was useful was the light that gave me a bright led that helped keep my tent lit when getting ready for bed. When I did try out the fan I was impressed by the air that came thru. Although my experience is more with the light I would say this is a necessary purchase for anyone taking a camping trip.
2,Great for 1st Time Parents,"My husband works shift work so it was extremely hard for us to attend lamaze classes, but this video made us feel so comfortable in our own home. We can always refer back to it if we need a refresher course. The breathing technique and education was on point."
1,very basic self talk,"This CD was really only an overview of self talk, and didn't provide any real self talk, like a Shad Helmstetter or other more well known writer."
1,Anno Dracula Boring,"The book was boring and to far fetched to be entertaining. The characters were not believable and left me with wanting to many unanswered questions. The author took to many liberties with facts. All in all, I just didn't care for the book, skipped thru pages to end it so I could go on to more enjoyable reading. Amazon offers so many options and choices that I'm bound to pick a lemon once in awhile. I always read the brief description of the book before I buy but in this book that wasn't enough."
1,not worthy to be a chick flick,"First, this movie has nothing to do whatsoever with the book except for the title. That said, once again Diane Lane plays someone who is supposed to be sympathetic as if she's a sociopath. Really - when she looks serious, you think she's about to kill someone. When she's happy she looks like she just did. Then you have the fact that nothing that happens in the movie is realistic at all -- except, if someone like Cameron Diaz were in the title role, we'd probably not care and even enjoy it. I feel used and cheap after being duped into watching this movie and I'm no longer going to waste my time on DL's films. She doesn't deliver. If she plays a Black Widow, I'll watch. If she plays another sensitive caring woman, I'll hurl first."
2,Bravo!!,"Although I am not one to normally take the time to share my opinion on things like this, I would have to say I feel I wanted to add something to the list of rave reviews. I love this CD! Although I agree that I would have liked more than twelve songs, the songs included are wonderful! Sometimes with something new you are drawn back by one or two songs hoping that they may ""grow on you"" but each song on the CD is great in my opinion. There was a great review given by Billboard on this CD, it will be interesting to see how it does. I personally feel this music is refreshing and a great choice over some of the trashy lyrics out there. Good luck to Clay on future endeavors......it is nice to see good things happen to good people and I love to listen to that awesome voice! My three year old also requests Clay Aiken!"
2,Works like a charm,"I bought a pair of these to replace similar hoses in my 5'er. The came on time, were well packaged, and work exactly as they should work. I had a tiny leak in one of the originals, and so replaced the pair. Very happy with the results."
1,Bad bad bad,"The information indicated that it was a new book for $8. But, when I received, it was an old book and had a sticker in the back of the shown it was $5.60. I can not believe it. I wish I can give it zero rating. But, I can not. It is really bad."
2,awesome,"this product is awesome and my son loves it, he never takes it off, he has gotten headbands before but none with this durabilty and quality."
1,Worst one to date,"Got two kids have used tons of diapers from various brands big and small - but was never appalled at its quality like my experience with this one. These diapers invariably leak on a regular basis and seem to have very little absorption capacity. Its hard to believe that this comes from Pampers, I have been pretty satisfied with them in the past. I hope this is a one-off, but it does make me a little apprehensive picking up Pampers again."
2,Poetry you can understand,"Tony's work turned me on to poetry. I used to believe that poetry was supposed to be un-understandable [stuff] with strange cadences, stupid rhyme schemes and bizarre capitalization. Tony's poems are deceptively easy to understand and they hit with the force of a punch to the gut. However, the ease with which they can be grasped, should not lead to the conclusion that there is not a hell of a lot more going on under the surface of these poems. There is. Tony's writing tells it like it is, and makes you think about the assumptions and occurrences in our daily urban landscape.Read these poems."
1,"ok, while it lasted....","It was ok, unless I left it on warm and the rice caked onto the bottom terribly. However, it stopped working after 4 months of use. Not sure what happened...."
2,Bjork rules!,"Bjork might be somewhat of an acquired taste, but even if you don't like her you have to admit that she is completely original and unlike any other artist out there. Bjork is always ahead of her time! Not all the songs on Post blew my mind but the ones that did (HyperBallad especially) make this album one of my favorites. Become a Bjork fan, you can always wow non-Bjorkers with her wonderful voice and melodic weirdness :) (Plus, Bjork is so adorable! I love seeing her in interviews just to hear her talk! :)"
1,What About the Rest of US?,"I gave this book one star because the author, in the beginning of the book, gives me useful information about the signs of having a gifted child. That is one of the reasons I bought the book and some of the information was useful.Now, on to the rest... Upon reading this material, I found it to be a self pat on the back from the author on her impressive portfolio of wealthy clients. I found plenty of information if I were an extremely rich person living in a community where the schools for the gifted were plentiful. All of her clients were fabulously well to do and their children were profoundedly gifted. So what about the rest of us? My husband is gainfully employed and I am a student. We have a modest income and our son is gifted. We found little practical advice for ordinary working parents. If you gross less than $200,000 a year, I would try another book."
2,Works as it should,I think that if this warmer was any hotter... it might cook my coffee during the day. I am just glad to reach over and not have my coffee stone cold. I really like it.
2,Cave Woman,"I had the misfortune to read the other three books of the series before reading clan of the cave bear but that did not detract from the joy of reading this book.Ayla's story is just that,although the author has written about our ancestors one should not take it as a trueism.Ayla's constant fight for survival and her success inspite of Broud's dislike for her,simply because she is diffrent from him helps push the story along.Their battle of their will continues even after her brutily beats and rapes her.Her decision to leave the clan inserch of her own is out of selfpreservation,leaving her son is hard but so necessary.The book is highly intresting and this authors eye for detail is truly awsom.Keep on Mz Auel.There is a rumor that there is another book in the works.Hurry PLEASE."
1,Disappointed,"I didn't even get a chance to play the game because it instantly crashed my computer; the CD was dirty outside when i got it, I'm very disappointed."
2,How to be a Quick Turn R.E. Millionaire by LeGrand,"This book is an excellent value on the subject of Real Estateinvestment. It is directed to the novice. The contents delineate""Nothing Down Techniques"" involving no cash. The author explainsthat not all debt is bad. Debt is good if it can pay off themortgage and provide a positive cash flow . The book shows how topurchase the ugly house on the street at a low price and sellhigh. Buyers can find great bargains from lists of condemnedhouses. Today, the HUD has many programs directed towardfixing up neighborhoods. There is a website ""Findtheseller.com"".Some perspective investors even leave business cards in vacanthouses to develop leads. Overall, this work is a good investmentif you will implement the recommendations contained, do therequired research and be patient!"
2,Nice rest,"Really nice portable bed, I don't wanna back sleeping in a regular bed!!!. I highly recommend this item for everybody who is looking for a good bed to be sleeping like a baby."
2,An heirloom for every American,"As the Library of Congress marks our country's history as the U.S.'s continual time capsule; this tome offers a glance into her walls. Beautifully assembled, this keepsake will instill pride in its citizenry. Making selections from myriad possibilities must have been a dire undertaking, but those represented indicate a fair cross-section of time and geography. An excellent tribute to a worthy source!"
1,could not get my dog to wear it,"i tried everything but he hated it. it was a no go. even though i set it to a snug fit, he kept pawing at it until he was finally able to get it into his mouth and chew on it."
2,Good reading from a business savvy CPA,"Harvey knows his stuff, which is obviously based on years and years of experience and seeing it all. The would-be and budding entrepreneur would be well advised to heed his advice. This book stresses the importance of working ON your business, not just IN your business."
2,Blaze Horse Books,"C.W. Anderson wrote a wonderful series of books about the adventures of Billy and Blaze. I read them as a child, probably more than once, so I bought the entire series to read to and give to my horse-loving granddaughter and grandson. These books are classics."
1,Yoo has no clue!,The 2 biggest mistakes made by government in my lifetime are Congress giving away war powers in 1965 and 2002. The constitution holds that declaring war is the responsibility of the Congress. If the Executive has grounds for war let him/her present them and Ccongress vote. Twice I have seen Congress abdicate this important power with disasterous results. This is just one of many examples why Yoo has no clue.
1,It's a supernatural feat in stupidity.,"To call this movie stupid does not do it justice enough. It's beyond stupid and it's an insult to the people who write for the comic that it's based on. Keanu Reeves literally stinks up the screen with his worse performance ever and the script helps him in spades. The special effects are just awful and the direction is just off center in a lot of places. There are some points about it like the performances of Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou that make this film a little better than what it is but other than their grand efforts to be better than the script, the movie just falls apart in every area excerpt their performances which is in fact better than the film itself.I hold much respect for the efforts made by Weisz and Hounsou but not even divine intervention could have saved this movie."
1,Only 17 Watts,Made in China. Doesn't keep my coffee warm enough. If I have a traditional small coffee mug that is half full it will keep pretty hot but if it's 3/4 full or a larger coffee mug then the coffee gets gets cold or at least not at the 125-130F degree I like. I'm returning and looking for more wattage. 17 watts isn't enough for me.
1,Wasn't that impressed........,"It didn't do much to slim the midsection and all it does is pretty much push everything up to the top, making your breasts and back look MUCH wider. If I do continue to wear it, it will be around the house or under loose clothes/jackets."
1,Much Is Missing,"This particular Dictionary does not come with conversion tables, or any of the other information that is advertised with this purchase. All it came with was the Atlas of Anatomy and the word definitions. So very upset with this purchase."
2,It's a good book,This is the first in a series of very good books following the life of a prehistoric woman. She uses creativity intelligence to live in a difficult environment.
1,Not all that Great! This cd kinda gets on your nerves,their first cd was ok but this cd really gets on your nerves the constant chage from singing to screaming sucks because the do it so often. I mean the first album was great and then this one pushed the anyoying limitations that the first one only mildley had. So if you really want a good cd go get Reveille's Bleed the sKY which actually has a good lead singer and doesn't change from fast guitar playing to slow anoying songs all the time.
1,Tasted awful and did not really work for me,"I was referred to this product by a lactation consultant who swore by it. I had gone back to work a few weeks prior and my supply was dwindling severly due to the pump not being nearly as efficient as my little man. I began taking far more than the recommended dose of the More Milk Plus, in an effort to really up my supply. The product tasted really nasty, even when mixed with a strong tasting drink and I did not see any major difference in my supply."
1,Completely useless,I used this for a year and a half on a wart on the underside of my big toe. All it did was kill all the healthy skin around it.
1,Buy some other album from those nice people at amazon,With no harmful intentions toward the movie brassed off.(thats where the talk at the begining of the song tubthumpin came from)Thank God I don't have any guns. Otherwise I wouldn't be here to write this review. What is this bait and switch. I first heard tubthumping on the radio very most excellent. Or so I thought. I bought the CD hoping for some good British tunes and what did i get. Stuff the baby on the cover could have written better. Please save shelve space never make another CD in this genre.
1,"cheap, but not worth the money","This product does not fit tightly. It tends to fall out of the plugs it is attached to, both at the computer (the male end) and at the cable (female end). Complaint to the provider went unanswered. We will have to buy a replacement."
1,Needle & Thread Not Included,"I bought the Mega Playland for my seventeen-month old son this past Christmas. I bought it on sale for $40 after reading mixed reviews. Sure enough - upon opening I found that every piece had a couple of four-five inch spans of seam that weren't sewn. After spending an hour with my needle and thread (on Christmas morning) it was ready to go. My son likes it. Our 100 pound dog likes it too, and it seems to be holding up fine so far."
1,Didnt last long,"The strap only lasted one day. Tied my labradoodle up outside a shop and when I came back he had chewed threw the bottom strap. The funny thing was he was just sitting waiting for me like nothing had happend, even though his lead was detached to where I tied him. I think the strap around the snout is too big and needs to be adjustable. I will get the next size down and see how we go with that."
2,I liked the book because...,"I liked the book Castle In The Attic because it was a book on a Dragon and a Knight. My three favorite parts were when William climbed the tree and got the apple for the cursed man. My other one was when he fought the dragon,and my last one was when William fought Alastor.Other kids should read this book so they will be more interested in reading the sequel Battle For The Castle."
1,Poor Quality,"This item does not look like the photo. It is very thin (.5"" or so) and the round decorative end part is very small (about 1.5"" diameter). There is a piece of white plastic that shows at the end of the rod that is not in the photo. It does not look well made- I would have preferred one of the plain white ones that you can buy anywhere- they look heavy duty next to this one. I have had an Amazon account for 10 years or so, and I have never before returned an item. This will be my first time."
2,One of the greatest albums ever made!,"I was reading the latest issue of Rolling Stone where they were rating the 150 greatest albums ever produced, and I was ecstatic to see that Post was nominated. I just had to share that with all of you music fans out there. Do you need anymore proof? This album has beat out countless others to have the honor to grace Rolling Stone as one of the most incredible albums EVER. What are you waiting for? Go get it!!!"
2,HP Laser Jet 1020,"These laserjets are well designed, work well and are easy to use. (We use 5 of the similar 1012 model and they are good workhorses.The 1020's installation disk is great -- with good pictures, easy instructions that any normal person could follow. Much better than the manuals written in engineering language. HP should be complimented."
2,An exciting adventure,"As one of the 100 greatest books written, at least this book doesn't leave you wondering why. It's a classic in it's sense of adventure, sci fi, and originality. Relatively short, this book keeps your interest throughout and it's main character of Captain Nemo is a true joy. In summary, a very entertaining book."
1,Worst English dub of a great TV series,"This sucked!The WORST English dub EVER!Crayon Shinchan is long TV series that lasted close to 12 years in Japan. Funimation did NOT purchase the entire series just a handful of episodes, so you don't see how the stories and characters developed and changed over the many seasons.The English dub they made changed the entire dialogue and Americanized practically ALL the characters and situations to an extreme low brow humor. Granted the original show did have a lot of puns, and low brow humor as well, but Shinchan did retain an innocence for his mischief, being the focus that he was always this incredible force of fun shaped as a 5 year old boy. True fans of the manga and series should NOT buy this lame production by Funimaiton."
1,Kindle Price Too High,"Harper Collins is about to join Penguin books in the Kindle boycott.I'm was set to put my enter Pratches library on Kindle but won't when I can buy a new mass market paper back at 20% less, right here on Amazon, from an ""alternate"" seller."
1,"""eh"" What was I thinking?","Ok I loath britney and Christina.And though I'm more of a Rock Music kinda guy myself, even I sometimes get pulled in by alot of catchy tunes from the secular pop music world. And sometimes I hate myself for singing that shallow filth. Stacie is SO GREAT! I've heard all the songs from her album. They're all so good, and the quality is far beyond Britney or Christina. Cause the only good songs on any of there albums are typically the singles. Stacie's lyrics are uplifting, but never cheesy. The beats are too hot! She sounds nothing like a 14yr old. I am now an official Fan and will buy anything she comes out with! I think she's way better then Rachael Lampa, but thats only cause her music has faster beats."
1,couldn't give it more stars,I haven't been able to get into it ...read only a bit and it hasn't held my attention...maybe I'll try again sometime... I know it is supposed to be like a classic so try it ....
2,"Interesting book, a little more detail would be nice.","This book did give the reader some very interesting facts and folk lore about archaeological discoveries that could prove the existence of superior ""giant"" races in the Americas. The only thing I did not like about the book (except for the grammatical errors), was that the author would mention some dramatic event (such as the discovery of giants' bones in a mound) and leave the reader hanging after a couple of paragraphs about the find. This book could have easily been an entire set of volumes, should everything have been explained in detail. Overall, it was a very interesting book leaving the reader wanting to know more about certain discoveries and theories within the book."
1,What are these guys?,"Oh man. I don't even know what these guys are. Are they dogs, cats, or 5 dollar bills? I have no idea. I wish we could take a look at this movie 80 years in the future and see what futuristic space people have to say about busting boos with a vacuum cleaner. I mean the symbolism is magnificent, the vacuum cleaner represents the struggles of mankind to end racism while the boos represent Strom Thurman. It's a beautiful masterwork that takes a certain Narron/Dorinsky-esque look at how retarded you are for reading this review."
2,"Wuzzup, Mariah!?! I'm Kaligirl from Seoul!","""When You Believe"" is an awesome song. To me Mariah's songs hit me like nukes! The awesome duet performed with Whitney Houston I'll never get sick of. This song(to me) is combined with spiritual, and also relates to the racism. I personally recommend this song to both Kids and Adults!"
1,"Stoner Rock, I think not!","First of all, don't even bother mentioning Sixty Watt Shaman in the same sentence as Alice and Chains and Soundgarden. Cantrell has more talent in his pinky than Sixty Watt has all together. If you want to check out real Stoner Rock, Kyuss and Queens of The Stone Age are a good start. This album is mediocre at best. Red Colony seems to be the only song I could really get into. Cool album cover though! Maryland must have a really lame Stoner Rock scene, because out here in CA, Sixty Watt Shaman would go unnoticed."
1,"The original recording probably sounded good, but the mastering on this CD is poor...","Whoever mastered this CD had no idea what they were doing (this makes me wonder what other CDs on this label are like). They use about one-quarter of the dynamic range available with 16-bit audio. Five bucks is pretty cheap for the disc, but you get what you pay for in this case. I'd probably opt for the other Eddie Fisher CD that has multiple albums (one of them being a Christmas CD) on it."
1,Histories and mysteries do not mix.,The most overrated book in the mystery genre is this attempt to fuse the mystery genre with the history genre. The mixture does not work. And Tey's conclusions are very out of date by now.
1,Tastes like sweaty gym socks,"I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me."
1,Parents - Don't Let Your Kids Watch This Movie,"Someone I know bought this in a discount rack, thinking it was what it pretends to be -- a children's holiday cartoon. Nothing could be further from the truth. I could not believe what a disgusting piece of filth it is, full of perverted sexual innuendo. Movies like this should not be marketed toward children, and no matter what the rating, that is who they were trying to target by making it look like a children's holiday cartoon. It should be kept in the back room of video stores with the restriction that only adults could see it (and then only if they have absolutely no taste nor moral fortitude whatsoever). I can't give this as strongly negative a review as it deserves! I only gave it one star because they wouldn't let me give it none."
1,never received,"Never received product, if price was wrong or something. Sent emails nobody emailed me other wise. Just lost my money, will not purchase through Amazon stores again."
2,A Different View,"For anybody who loves Michael Wadleigh's Woodstock boxset and wants even more film document of this mecca, then this is it. D.A.Pennebaker (Monterey Pop Festival) and Chris Hegedus to a great job directing this documentary of three days of peace and music and presenting the music in order as it happened. There are a few quick shots and longer cuts of festival goers that were in the Wadleigh film but it blends in well to this 3 hour film. I highly recommend this documentary from this historical landmark event of 1969."
1,c'mon nintendo,"i'm not gunna lie. this is not a good movie. other game titles would have made a much better story. If they chose kirby, maybe. they could have made a million jokes about a wierd blob and an evil penguin. they could have had action with dark matter in a battle. they should make this movie, instead of more dumb mario movies. Kirby and King Dedede beat Mario and Luigi by a mile."
2,good batman but not great,"i think this movie good it,s has it,s flaws bale batman ,s was better than batman forever and batman robin but this movie put,s more foucs on the comics than the batman himself the blade movies were much better. bale batman wasn,t bad but it wasn,t great. a minor comeback for DC comics it,s better the batman films that before it,s even better than superman returns because christian bale is minor star he,s not a list like the people who played batman before him. keaton was a household or become household name when he played batman i think this movie a good step bale to help his career he did me forget about superman returns . one thing he had right or this movie the joker kill did not batman pranets like in the frist batman movie ."
2,New facts learned and old ones enlightened,"When I first saw this book in my local book store about a year ago, I thought: Great, another book on the Titanic giving the same old facts and the same stories that every book on the Titanic contain. But then I picked it up and started reading, I learned about the more about the feelings of the officers and crew that night and the feelings of the men who found her. Although the book jumps around a bit, it was still enjoyable to read."
2,Carlton edition is the one to look for,"This Carlton release has no problems, it is a genuinely good copy of the 1971 Hammer Film, Reg. 2 from Great Britain. It is an intriguing twist on the Jack the Ripper story with great performances by Eric Porter, Angharad Rees and others directed by Peter Sasdy, even though Hammer by this time was on the decline. Synapse Films who brought out a Reg. 1 edition of ""Vampire Circus"" is supposed to later this year put out ""Hands of the Ripper"" and ""Twins of Evil."" ""Vampire Circus,"" in otherwise a great presentation, was printed too dark and one must adjust the ""Contrast"" button. This Carlton release has no such hindrances."
1,I imagine if you get a working one this would be very useful.,I had to rate this low because the one I received was broken or had some sort of short in the wire and didn't work. I'm pretty sure a working one would be very useful.
1,This movie is a disservice to Vietnam vets.,"In 1967 and 1968, I was squad leader in Vietnam in the 25th Infantry Division. This is yet another Hollywood movie that portrays Vietnam combat vets as perverts, and heartless killers. Nothing could be farther from the truth. War is brutal and ugly and the Vietnam War was no exception, but young Americans served honorably in Vietnam as Americans have in other wars. Yes, these things may have happened, but they were the exception and not the rule. It seems that most of the movies I've seen focus on the same negative themes. If you REALLY want to know what the war was like, the only DVD I could fully recommend is ""Dear America, Letters Home from Vietnam"". This DVD contains actual Vietnam War footage, which is mixed with letters home read by Tom Berenger, Robin Williams, Robert Deniro, Michael J. Fox, Martin Sheen and many others. Please see this video if you really want to begin to understand what combat vets experienced and how they conducted themselves."
2,smoothing serum,"The product is wonderful for my hair which is very curly and tends to be frizzy. Smooths it and gets rid of allof the friz. Use it once a day, even in damp weather"
2,Beautiful story!,"This movie is based loosely on the true story of France Mayes. It's so fun and captivating! Diane Lane is flawless, as usual. The Italian scenery is breathtaking! I hope to see the landscape someday, but until then, this movie takes me away there. I love the whole vibe of the movie... beautiful and cheery. All of the characters are perfect!I also stumbled on to a daily planner based on the story... filled with gorgeous pics and quotes, stories, and recipes from Frances. So, keep a look-out for this years! It really is a nice accompaniment to the movie!"
2,Giono is a lyrical master comprable to Ovid,"In this parable of Elazard Bouffier, Giono paints a picture of hope. A quiet hope for the future, resting on the solid principles of classical learning, humanism and sound ecological thinking.Reading this book is like a run through the forest, like diving in tall grass and listening to crickets during summer. This slender volume is one of the most magnificant works of literature ever produced."
1,Worst Ever,"This product is fantastic for those whose climate never varies by more than one degree. When I saw the name ""Timex"" I was somewhat apprehensive but said to myself, ""How can they mess up a thermometer?"". I don't know how they did it but they did, big time. Admittedly, for $5.99 I didn't expect a device approved by the National Weather Service but this product is overpriced by about $5.98. Rather than going through the hassle of returning it I joyously took a hammer to it and took out many inner frustrations. I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy."
2,Great Activity Book - Cover Questionable,"This book is great for little active hands. Its a Pop-up kind of thing (the moving parts of pop-ups, not the actual 3D stuff) all made of thick card board so its pretty indestructable. That is, except for the cover. I'm not sure what they were thinking. Its a single piece of cardboard, flimsier than cereal box cardboard. I'm not sure why they did that, especially since the reverse of the cover is the first page of the book. The rest of the pages (and back cover) are all thicker than even the sturdiest boardbook. I still give it a solid rating though - sometimes you just have to wonder what people are thinking."
2,Hilarious,"I loved this movie. It was hilarious and Sandler's fans especially will be cracking themselves up. I must admit that it is very crude at parts, so although the cover looks appealing for youngsters, it probably isn't suitable for the young ones. Although, I must admit that a lot of the jokes will go right over their heads.The message is good and the overall story has a message. I cried for Whitey, and I think any movie that moves a person to the point of crying is worth a watch. But it is HILARIOUS, from the triple breasted lady, to Whitey and his sister, to the deer (who's significance I really didn't understand).A must see for anyone <over 13> with a good (but stupid) sense of humour and a desire for a couple of laughs!"
2,"Works well, but antenna cable is a little short...","Bought it for a 2nd computer that is on the other side of the house (100 feet or so). Used the drivers provided (running WinXP Pro). Usually has 3-4 bars (out of 4) of reception, has not caused a reboot that I know of (system is not on for long spans of time). The only problem is that the cable does not allow me to place the antenna on top of the CPU case (full-sized desktop case).Overall, a very good rating."
1,Need a dictionary!,"The Scarlet Letter is an interesting book. While reading the book I was filled with many feelings about it. I enjoyed some chapters, but loathed the ones describing the characters. I felt as if Hawthorne could have told the story more efficiently if he had described each character as they came onto the scene. The book made me feel inferior and uneducated. I made so many trips to get the dictionary that my legs got tired. I enjoyed the general story-line, but I could have left the adjectives behind. Pearl was my favorite character because she had a priceless intuition that helped me read the book. I would have been lost without Pearl's hints. I would not have read this book if not required to by my English teacher. Attack it if you dare!!"
2,The book of my life,"I have read this book once already and I am reading it agian right now. It is the most inspiring and motivating book that I have ever read. It seems that every time that I am loosing the sight of my spiritual path this book seems to pop up. I love it and recommend to every one, no matter if they are a spiritual person or not."
2,one of kerouac's finest,"I've heard it said that this is Kerouac's greatest novel. I still say that honor is held by On the Road, but this book is just as good. And it is his most spiritual novel. Kerouac combines his talent at writing with his philosophy of life and what you have is a powerful tool to enlightenment. This book should be read on at least two levels, as a work of great literature and as a theological tool. I can't recommend it enough."
2,A fail-free link from room to room!,"My TiVo and my internet connection are in separate rooms, so I was very happy to have the opportunity to avoid running big, ugly ethernet cables all over my house. This adapter allows my TiVo to talk to my wireless router (made by Netgear), which it has done for over a month, so far, without any lapses in connection. Set-up was very easy, even with my closed network (the MAC address appeared right on my TV screen, through the TiVo box, so that I could identify it from the router management page).My TiVo box is a Series-2, single tuner. The adapter is clearly fully compatible with it.It does just what I need it to do! What more can I ask?"
1,More info needed,"There are some many memory cards in the market, that I think the list of the camera brands and models should be available with the product description so it will be easier to find the more convenient for the one we are looking for, or when asking for products all of the choices for a specific brand of cameras will be presented in the results.R Limon"
2,Great book to start!,"The book is excelent because you can learn almost everything related do struts. The book is well written, but has some mistakes."
2,Perfect,"It comes in the box you see, the daipers are wrapped up tight in 3 big sets, it arrived in good time and has been a huge help with my newborn."
2,Interesting,"After watching the Disney movie 20,000 Leagues, I wanted to read the real story to see what else it had to tell. It was a very good read, long, but good."
1,You get what you pay for.,One of my Pioneer speakers broke so I took the cheapest path and bought Jensen. I should have known better. The magnet on the Jensen is 1/3 the size of the one it was replacing. I installed the one speaker and before I installed the second one I decided to try it out. Not only did it sound terrible but it blew within five minutes. Keep in mind that I have a standard Kenwood 40x4 head unit without any extra amp and I had it turned up up about three quarters. This speaker is week and as I stated in the title you get what you pay for.
2,no leaking ...,"Great, soft, secure diapers. My son [..]and I have been using Pampers FLEX for a long time. A few months ago I decided to try a cheaper brand for a change and sure enough, he leaked!!! UGH! Make sure you buy the FLEX DRY -- they are stretchie, soft and seemingly comfy for baby."
1,thin,"The picture seems to show a somewhat robust rod, but what you get is a very thin (1/2"") rod. When exteneded to near its mazimum length it becomes very flimsy and will barely hold my small shower curtain without bowing in the middle. I would have expected a little better for the price and the intended use. But, it works and it's black."
1,It is hard to describe just how bad this is.,"I like Billie Holiday.I like dance remixes.I just love the Sarah McLachlan remix CD.I feel I have a very open mind and a very diverse taste in music which ranges from country to classical to classic rock to dance/trance to pop. U2, Tiesto, Bach and Garth. As long as it sounds good.Which this doesn't. There are two basic problems. First, Billie's attraction was her syrupy lingering over the sound. It oozes sexuality but not the rhythmic mechanical pelvic thrusting kind. Second, when you take a sound track that is utterly devoid of rhythm and *then* do a bad job of adding a dance backdrop, the result is just too wierd for words.I can only conclude that this CD was released as some kind of joke just to prove that people will buy *anything*.Well, I bought and I'm sorry..."
2,a new king,"Steve Tene Bimbo was 25yrs old when his grandfather King Tene died. The grand father skipped over his son (a fat gross slob) to give Steve the medallion and the ring of kingship. This set off a war.Gypsies are mostly known for their grift, scams and cons but when called upon they can fight and kill too. Several attempts are made on his life but he survives. Read this book and see what happens.Steve tells author Peter Maas that he wants to change and he wants to change the way the gypsies live. The book ends there and we do not know if he was successful. The book is very very short. You can read it almost in 1 sitting. Some of the reviews are longer than the book.bbp okc ok2009"
2,Just what I wanted,Thanks for providing me with an oldie but goodie. The Greengage Summer came to me in great condition for an older book.
2,Bad boys meet bad girl,"25 years after the seventh Earl of Lucan clobbered his wife and killed the nanny, he shows up in Paris at the office of psychiatrist Dr. Hildegard Wolf. But she already has a patient who claims to be Lord Lucan. Will the real one please prove it? And what about Hildegard, who really is Beate Pappenheim, a fugitive fake stigmatic from Bavaria? The author has great fun twisting things around between these three bad people, at times coming close to the Keystone Cops. But blood will tell, with murder, with stigmata and with the British nobility. This book does not make much sense, but it is good fluffy fun.Amusing sideline: Bavaria had a well-known stigmatic - Therese von Konnersreuth - who ""practised"" there from 1925 until her death in the 1960s. She was never accused of fraud but, to this day, Rome is rather sceptical."
1,Arrived broken!,"Well, this is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" kind of reviews. Didn't pay much, didn't expect much, but basically functional would've been nice. The generator came broken (probably a miswire internally). Yep, I checked the outs with a meter... and if I finagled the probe inside and touched the right spot, I got voltage. Just not externally. Too much trouble to return it and convinced my 10-year old to go with a real light powered by batteries."
2,Odd that this is my favorite...so you know it has to be good,"I'll keep it short since I want to go eat my lunch. Out of the hundreds (at least) of CDs I've listened to, this is my favorite of ALL TIME. Which is weird, because I don't have any other Amy Grant albums, and I'm actually not interested in any other albums by her. So you know there has to be something great about it. I heard this album, and promptly went out to buy it. I went on a cross-country train trip by myself last summer, and this CD was a great one to have while I looked out at America flying past my window and thought about life. I don't mean to sound dramatic or over-the-top, but this CD affects me in a way that VERY few other albums do. It trancends the normal music world."
2,Phenomenal,"After just listening to a few clips of this CD on the internet made me want this one. Now after hearing the entire CD, I am soooo glad to have one!!!! Clay's voice is truly remarkable, the lyrics great, and the music is beautiful. I recommend this highly, you won't be disappointed."
2,THE BOMB,"I THINK THAT THIS ABLUM IS THE BOMB. I BOUGHT THIS ABLUM ABOUT 2 MONTHS AND LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME AND FOUND MANY SOUNDS THAT I HEAR ON THE RADIO. BUT THE ONE THAT I NEVER HEARD WERE ALSO INSPIRING AND MOTIVATING AND VERY DELIGHTFUL TO HER. EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEARD ME LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM ASK ME ""WHO IS THAT"" AND ""WHERE CAN I GET IT"" IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS ABLUM AND LOVE GOSPEL *GET IT* OKAY!"
2,Informative and entertaining to read,"For the fact that the book was written just a few years after Li's death, information was fresh and probably quite accurate. I just wish that the book has a lot more photos. I enjoyed reading it."
1,"DO NOT BUY, A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!","My daughter wanted this for a few months before I finally gave in and bought it for her. She was so excited. We got home and played it for one hour hoping that something different or better would happen. The game was so so boring. You get to choose music, outfits, and which of the three skaters to skate. That is IT. Everything else is controlled automatically by the game. Barbie does everything perfectly whether you do or not. My daughter hasn't played it since and is so disapointed in it. The store I bought it from won't let me return it because it has been opened. They will let me exchange it for the exact same game but hello that is the problem. This game was a waste of time and money."
1,Speed Race Car Remote Control,"this toy is bad, Send my time is bad.But business is good,trustworthyHope after business before the shipment can add check the quality of the goods."
1,"A predictable, formulaic, thriller",Psychosexual? I figured out the plot twist in the first few pages and the murderer as soon as he/she was introduced.
2,Like it,"I always buy Pampers Cruise before this. This is the first time I tried Pampers Baby-Dry. The quality is good, soft and a little bit thinner than Pampers Cruise, it's what I expected, especially in summer, I think thinner diaper is better."
2,Eliminated my acid reflux,"My acid reflux started a year ago. Whenever I lied down, my esophagus would start hurting within minutes. I tried just about all of the various acid reducing pills, both prescription and non-prescription as well as many natural remedies, with limited effect. I still woke up every hour or two at night and had to chew antacids to be able to sleep the next hour.After using this pillow for a few days my acid reflux pain disappeared and I don't need medication anymore. I place the back support pillow along the lower edge of the wedge pillow, inside the pillowcase, to elevate my rib cage. I use the neck support pillow together with a regular pillow, inside a pillowcase, to support my neck. I try to sleep as much as possible on my left side, although after a couple of weeks there was no discomfort sleeping either on my back or on my right side."
1,Robocop becomes Aerocop!,"Whoa!! A flying robocop with the strings attached and all. No way man, this one bombs. And where's Peter Weller? The dude IS Robocop!!! Cheesy movies I can handle, but this one's going moldy. Time for Robocop III to catch a wave. See yah!"
1,Dissappointing,"Purchased this bike rack after visiting the Saris website and searching for a bike rack that could be used with a VW Beetle and Toyota 4Runner. The rack arrived in a timely manner but.........instructions were vague and hard to follow. My husband and I spent a couple of hours trying to install the rack & 2 bicycles onto the 4Runner. We could get the rack on - tight & secure - but the weight of the bicycles caused the upper legs to pull away from the rear window. We finally gave up and returned the rack to Amazon. In addition, no way could the rack be used on the VW - straps and metal clips would have to be attached to glass which the instructions clearly said should not happen. I consider my husband & I to be reasonably intelligent but possible that there was something we failed to do????????A positive....Amazon paid for return shipping and credited my credit card - no questions asked."
2,Worth the Wait!,Clay sounds better than ever! I should buy another one for the car I can't stop listening.
1,"Terrible, Terrible Book!","Bradbury is a good writer (I'll give him that), but I HATE his writing style. He starts making huge long mini-stories within the main story that has no point and is useless. He could have written this book in 50 less pages, and it might've gotten 2 stars. I think this is a terrible book, no offense to anyone who likes it."
2,I really like this music because of the words and the story,"The singers are very good, both of them has a very nice voice and they are talented singer. I enjoy listening this music very much"
2,Great Fantasy,"This book was one my parents bought for me, it took me a while to get into it, but I was determined to read it. Halfway through the book I got to where I didn't want to put it down at all, I just sat and finished the entire book in one day, a great book that I would read again."
2,You should get if u haven't already!!!,"You should get Nelly's new Sweatsuit if you haven't already because it's a great album. It has songs from both his Sweat and Suit albums and 3 new songs including the hot single Grillz with Paul Wall,Ali & Gipp. So if you don't have it yet you should go cop it cause it's classic Nelly material"
1,Don't go there,"'Coyote Ugly' often gets compared to 'Flashdance'and sort of falls in the same genre, but it lacks both the charme and the choreography that made 'Flashdance' a success. It is hard to blame the actors for the failure to maintain the audience's interest, they simply didn't have anything to work with. The plot is entirely predicable, and all the characters (how did they do that?) remain without any depth. As a result, the different plots running through this feature appear strangely unrelated, maybe because as a viewer one just doesn't get engaged. Easily one of the worst offerings in the last 12 months, maybe ever."
1,note to self: read reviews before buying,"I'm now on my third charger for my Powerbook (my dad says I'm rough on equipment). Let me tell you, the Macally is NOT it. Like others, it fluctuates between charging and battery every 1-2 seconds and the brick makes weird squeaky noises. After not having a computer for a week and being so relived to finally get this charger, I was almost in tears to find that it is a piece of crap. It charges when the computer is off or in sleep mode, but that's not going to cut it. If you have a Powerbook G4, don't waste your money on this."
2,HAPPY FATHER.,"PARA EL PRIMER CUMPLEAÃ‘OS DE MI HIJO, LE COMPRE EL MEGALAND. EN CUANTO LO INSTALE EN SU CUARTO (ES FACIL ARMARLO), MI HIJO ENTRO GATEANDO Y SE PUSO A JUGAR CON LAS PELOTAS. CASI NO LO PODEMOS SACAR PARA DORMIRLO. AHORA LE GUSTA JUGAR MUCHO CON LOS PRIMOS Y AMIGOS. LAS PELOTAS QUE TRAE (50) SON INSUFICIENTES, LE COMPRE 150 ADICIONALMENTE. ESTAMOS PENSANDO EN COMPRARLE LOS ADICIONALES PARA AMPLIARLO."
2,outstanding,"I first read this book 30 years ago and I was certain that it explained much in American politics at that time. As I read it today, I see that it still explains much of American politics, but, it also explains much of politics of nations throughout the world and is fully consistent with much of the more cynical writings of political philosophy over the years, such as Machievelli. This is a fantastic story that is VERY easy to read, get involved in, relate to the main character, and find oneself caught in the truth of versus the appearance of reality. Excellent!!! A+"
1,Painful Experience,"I think the concept is great but with this particular product, they have these sections that are thicker rubber (or whatever the material is) and it literally pushed into my ribs every time I sit down. I commute a lot and have a desk job so its not a very pleasant experience to have that pushing and bruising your rubs every day. It would've been nice except for those thicker lines of rubber that aren't very flexible."
2,Perfect,"If you don't like this movie there is something wrong with you. It was easy to follow, and it had the perfect mix of action, drama, and suspence. For an added bonus they threw in some sweet techno music that you have to love."
2,Good set for roof tiles,"This has the more shallow sloped roof tile. There is another type that is steeper. They do connect, they are just not the same pitch.This is an excellent set to be able to get enough roof tiles to actually cover the roof of a house. It is a bit expensive, but it's not too easy to go about it any other way.The doors and windows are a very large scale. They're just fine, too, if you like this size. I'm not a fan, myself--I like the older style of doors and windows. But those are basically out of production. I would think most kids would be fine with them."
2,What a great toy!,"I had an RCA mp3 player that used cards. I decided to purchase this one based on its reviews and cost. I'm not sorry. The only thing I had challenges with was transferring music from my PC and CD's to the player. I searched and searched and finally figured it out. I think Creative needs to have a picture of the software in the quick guide so people know which window is which.I love the ability to organize and listen to music using several options: genre, artist, etc.. It transfers very quickly (using a 2.0 USB hook-up) and sounds great. I'm just beginning to play with it so I'm looking forward to finding out everything I can about it. It isn't much larger/heavier than an IPOD and is very versatile (not to mention a whole lot less expansive). I also like the fact that it's a ""mini"" external hard drive so I can store large files on it if necessary."
2,"The Canterbury Tales, Reviewed by Philip Moore","Have you ever sat amongst friends, or maybe even strangers, and swapped stories with each person attempting to make their tale appear to be the most impelling. This is in essence the design of Geoffrey Chauncer's ""Canterbury Tales"", a collection of stories told by a group of travelers on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Of these stories the most noted are ""The Knight's Tale"", ""The Wife of Bath's Tale"", ""The Miller's Tale"", ""The Reeve's Tale"", and ""The Parson's Tale"". Chaucer, born in the early 1340s (the exact date is unknown), lived a most notable life and had a profound impact on English literature. Much of his works are influenced by love and his distain for the Church in the form of satirical humor. The latter due impart to the corruption within the clergy and the condition of the people from their suffering of drought, famine, and disease. Chaucer's work brought to light a new age of literature full of wit, comedy, and daily life."
2,Easy read for brain information,"This book was purchased for a PhD level course. It is a very easy read. It gives practical applications to the latest brain research. On a down note, there are not a lot of references documented within the text when Jensen quotes a study, but he does give an extensive bibliography. This book can be used for parents to read about how their child's brain works, or for teachers within a school system. It is a good book to read if you want basic information about the brain from an education standpoint."
2,Great product,"I am so happy with this product. My drawers stay neat, clean and most umpotantly organized - I can find everything quickly."
1,Not this time,"This product has worked for me in the past but not this time. Not only could I smell this when plugged in, it smelled like burning plastic and made me physically ill.I used the collar with much better results, to be honest."
2,A Subpar Ripoff of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,"Seriously the art work, music and general theme reek of glam rock.But If you love Ziggy/Bowie and glam era its not bad, reminds me alot of the Velvet Goldmine movie for some reason for its sameless copying of bowies classic album. I picked this up around 1998 in a dumpster bin at a discount music store for probably around 99centsAnd its definately not the worst 99cents I've spent.Velventeen/Glitter Queen = Lady StardustShoeGazer = Ziggy Stardust"
1,What went wrong with this film?!,"This film was a major disappointment. I expected so much more from the director of freaking ""Die Hard"". The direction, acting, and writing were all a joke. This film left you with the feeling that it was all just thrown together, and no one took it that seriously. There were lots of things in this film that just didn't make any sense at all. Someone explain: Why was that desert chase scene filmed in night vision? WHAT IN THE HECK WAS UP WITH THAT?! The editing was choppy and scenes were just thrown together. I gave this film two stars for one reason: The skateboarding scene at the beggining was sorta cool. Thats about it.SKIP IT. ""Rollerball"" is a loser."
1,Pampers are worse than Store Brand,"I keep trying Pampers. With my daughter, they leaked and didn't fit well. With my son, I have tried Baby Dry and Cruisers at different stages and still, they fit awful. The tabs feel cheap and they don't stretch as well as Huggies. I give up on Pampers. Some store brand diapers fit and stretch better."
2,love my rice cooker,I love love love this rice cooker. It was finally time that I got a decent cooker. Don't bother buying a cheap rice cooker. It is a waste of money and they really can't compare to using a machine like this.
2,An amazing tale of friendship and loyalty.,"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a classic tale of loyalty and friendship. It is about two friends named George Milton and Lennie Small who are a couple of laborers going from job to job. Steinbeck is able to capture the personalities of two poverty stricken friends during the great depression. George, a small out spoken man is responsible for Lennie, a larger hardworking man whom is mentally retarded. Both share a common dream of owning some land and being treated fairly. But a cloud of bad luck shadows them. Of Mice and Men was well written and easy reading"
1,Femalien,For this kind of movie your not supposed to get bord and skip through most of it. But that's what happened.Only 1 person could act. Most of the women where max 5s. The best part of the movie is the front cover.
1,"Poor instructions, but once you figure it out... kinda cool","These wraps were not doing anything when we placed them in ""hot"" water. We searched the internet and found others having the same problem. The instructions are very poor. First off, you need to dip in boiling water (or at least some temperature level above what I would call hot). Second, the instructions don't describe what should happen, should the image shrink around the egg, transfer to it -- what?Needless to say, it was frustrating for a minute or two, but my wife - who is very intelligent and great in the kitchen - immediately thought, ""well... hot water wouldn't do much to change the properties of the plastic, so let's try boiling water - nothing to lose.""Should be more explicit in the instructions. (We were using the star wars version of this product)."
2,"Great Character Study, Fascinating and Expertly Acted!","This movie has a great script and wonderful acting by all the cast, I was surprised that Brendan Fraser did a good job with his role. If you know something about James Whale or liked his movies then it will prove more interesting. The movie starts out a bit slow but then grabs you and doesn't let go until the end, but fascinating throughout. I was surprised that the gay subject-matter did not make me feel uncomfortable (as with other similarly-themed movies). Expert performances by Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave make this all the more rewarding. See this movie. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie an 8!"
2,third secret,"Steve Berry has become one of my favourite authors. The Third Secret does not disappoint, Get ready for a thrilling ride."
1,"Why re-make a great classic as a horrible expensive ""b"" movie??","OK, I have to say that the original movie made in the early 60s is one of my favorites of all time. With very little in the way of special effect and all the crap now available to Hollywood, it manages to be a truly engaging and frightening film.So I had hopes for at least a reasonably good movie, I mean why re-make a great film if you're not going try to at least make one that is at least half as good?? Especially with the promise of the great talents of Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor, I expected a lot.What I got was crap. CGI assisted crap. Liam Neeson was sort of not there, and Lili Taylor was NOT good. In fact she was really horrible which was quite disappointing. Her work in other films is wonderful, but it may just be that Sci-fi/Fantasy is really REALLY not where she belongs.All around disappointing. Seriously, DO NOT remake great movies if you cannot do any even better job of telling the story! Its a waste and an annoyance!"
2,"The Clan Of The Cave Bear, and the other books were great.","In this book, you travel back in time to a world without the knowledge we have today. In some cases it was better back then. The world was fresh, unspoiled, and there were a group of people that called themselves:The Clan Of The Cave Bear. Ayla, the beautiful heroine, is left orphened in a strange world after her ""tribe"" gets killed by a natural disaster. As Ayla grows, she strugles to learn the ancient ways of the clan. She then has a son. When there is a new leader, he banishes her. To find out more details read the book! Even though I started the series when I was in the sixth grade, last year, I love this series, and have already finished it. I'm dying to read the next one."
1,"Wonderful book, except for the part with all the words.","The first time I tried to read Foundation, I was six years old, and it was simply too complex for my developing mind. Just a few months ago, however, I was cleaning out my attic and came across the same old book. To ascertain it's actual nature as interpreted by the adult mind, I read it again. I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it, not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter, but mostly by the writing, which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky, the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter, and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito. As a book, it could be improved by changing the title from ""Foundation"" to ""How Not to Write a Book"" or ""Please Steal These Ideas and Rewrite Them in English."" I highly reccomend it to people for use as a very expensive and ineffective paperweight."
2,Great Read!!!!,Shows how the story of one man can make a difference. Such a good read about the life of a slave. Something alien to a lot of people. The book draws you in from the start you wont want to put it down.
1,BEWARE False advertisement,"This is a Graber guadian 3 ike rack, NOT a Saris guadian 3. I purchased it and it looks very simular, but has no anti-sways and the straps are a hard cheap plastic. I called the company and they said all they could do was have me send it back and get my money back. I informed them that the pictures on the advertisements were not of the one they sent me and they just said if I was unhappy with my purchase, I could return it. This was a week ago, and as I see they still advertise the Saris with anti-sways and rubber hold down straps. BEWARE of this company!!!!"
1,"Not available yet,how can it be reviewed?",I don't understand how a DVD that hasn't been released yet has received so many reviews-all of them great. Has this DVD been released elsewhere?
1,"Great story, nice binding, difficult translation","The hardcover version of the Sterling edition is bound and printed nicely. Jules Verne's story is enthralling and full of detail. However, the translation in the Sterling edition is very old and can be rather tongue-twisting when read aloud. The word ordering in the sentences often reflects the original French a bit too much. Likewise, the numereous names of various flora and fauna are rendered in Latin form, rather than the more common names I'm familiar with. I've found Frederick Paul Walter's newer (and also unabridged) translation to be much easier to read:Amazing Journeys: Journey to the Center of the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, Circling the Moon, 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas, and Around the World in 80 Days."
2,"A great book, makes you believe in how good a story can be","""Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me: There lie they, and here lie we Under the spreading chestnut tree."" 1984 is a powerful book about communism and one mans defiance against it. Imagine the world split up into three huge superstates which all are communist. The government controls your way of life, where you work, what you think, how to love, what your provisions will be, and everythiing in between. It is a stunning tale of passion and rebellion that ends with a BANG. A must read for anyone who loves a good story. BEWARE OF ROOM 101."
1,Can't understand why this is a classic,"Started off with a bang, but then got bogged down with endless description of the scenery. I guess no one ever told Verne to show rather than tell."
1,Mr. Coffee Mug warmer,I was very disappointed with this. It barely keeps my mug of coffee warm - barely luke warm for that matter. I don't recommend this product.
2,A Great Selection of Flavors in an Attractive Box,This is a wonderful assortment of absolutely delicious tea. The tea is full of flavor and aroma. This made a great gift for me and will surely please the tea drinkers in your life as well. The box is also nice and my young daughter has plans to store little trinkets in it once it is empty.
2,great seller and product,"This seller was great, I recieved my product in a matter of days,....and not weeks. The product was exactly what the seller said it was, and it did everything the seller said it would do."
2,Great listening and worth every penny,"John Townsend is the man with the voice, and it might be one of the finest vocal performances ever. If you don't believe it, just sit back and listen to this album from start to finish. The lyrics are interesting and fun and the performance is outstanding."
1,The Ultra-PC Comic Book,"If you liked Miller's Dark Knight series, you probably won't like this one. In fact, unless you're into extreme political correctness, you won't like this one.All the good guys are minorities. All the bad and dumb ones are white. And so on. This seems like an 180-degree reversal from his Batman books, which were somewhat negative on liberal issues (well, justice, at least).But Miller obviously wanted it to be a work on par with Moore's ""Watchmen"" - why else waste Gibbon's talent on this book? Perhaps it was a catharsis, because it seems like a lot of venting - against Reagan, against white males, against evil phallic space stations, against ... well, enough said. Read ""Watchmen"" again instead. Or why waste time with comic books? Although Moore's stuff is always interesting, most comic-book philosophy is at the pop level. Sounds deep and attractively cynical ... until you delve. Read something serious. Recommendations: ""Darwin's Black Box"" (Behe), ""Nature's Destiny"" (Denton)."
2,Jesse a good story,"I liked this book , the story was interesting and it showed different sides of American culture from the eyes of an immigrant farm worker."
1,Seriously watered down,"There is nothing in this book that you won't find in a begining statistics course. The author gives lots of definitions of the most commonly used words and then provides examples. The reading is light and easy and sometimes amusing. However, it is a flimsy paperback made from low quality paper. There are LOTS of typos in this book. Definitely not worth $12."
2,The Greatest Love Story of Our Time.,1984 is a social commentary on history and the appalling state of public policy and society generally told through a love story that resonates with a deep familiarity for all modern readers.
1,Kindle Edition is a very sloppy copy/paste,"The Kindle Edition of 1984 is incredibly sloppy. There are some blatant typos I'm surprised weren't noticed by editors, but the real slap in the face is when there are page numbers (from the print edition) in the middle of sentences that someone didn't bother removing when they copy/pasted the book from whatever was on file."
2,TP-2 is Sexiest Album Ever Release !!!!!!,"When the Classic R.Kelly`s TP-2.Com Album was release about almost 2 1/2 years ago marked the way,to this date, from the R&B Music Point of View from a artist. This time is not a artist, IS THE BEST ARTIST HAS EVER LIVE, MR.GENIUS= R.KELLY. He brings the Most Sensual and Sexiest Songs Ever recorded in a complete album by any R&B Singer. Songs like: ""Strip for You"", ""The Greatest Sex"", ""Just Like That"", ""Like a Real Freak"", ""Don`t You Say No"", ""One Me"", ""Woman`s Threat"", ""I Decided"", ""Feelin On Yo Booty""(WOW), DON`T SAY ENOUGH?,WELL IS UP TO YOU TO BUY THE BEST SMOOTH AND SENSUAL BABY MAKING MUSIC EVER."
1,This is NOT the true story of the Manson Murders!!!,"This book is well written and highly detailed but it cannot be farther from the truth. Mr. Bugliosi's ""Helter Skelter's"" theory is just laugh out funny, plainly ridiculous. This is Bugliosi's story, not Charlie's. The biggest mistake you can make is buy bugliosi's story of the events and believe Charlie as the mastermind of the killings. But I won't lie, I couldn't put this book down. It would've been great if it were true, but it's not."
1,Not a Dan Brown,I bought this book based on buyer's reviews. I was very disappointed. This book is filled with much violence and little mystery/content.
2,Cool tools for PLAYTIME FUN!,My daughter loves this caddy and really enjoys playing with playdoh ( she's 3 ). It has a lot of cool tools like scissors and a pizza cutter that are very toddler friendly. I think the caddy center island needed to be a bit bigger. We have other play doh sets and it doesn't all fit in the caddy.
1,ugh,The packaging was coming off the back of the package and the box it was in was distorted. I wanted to give this as a christmas present but it doesn't even look new!
1,Don't buy the Kindle edition,"This is not easy to read in Kindle format. In paperback, it has two translations: one in Middle English, the other in Modern English. These are displayed side by side, with the earlier English on the left, Modern on the right. When it comes to the Kindle edition, there are no breaks between these translations. It switches back and forth without any notice, making it really difficult to follow. It would be alright if we could view it page by page (in it's original format), but without that option it's harder to understand. (Yes, it's obvious which part is which, but finding where it stops and starts takes away from the reading experience. It's too choppy.)In short, buy the paperback or perhaps a different Kindle edition. The format makes this a challenge to read."
2,Classic!,Literary classic that I am glad that I read. I just wish I read it years ago. I will have to go back to my childhood home to see if I can find the book I had when I was a child.
1,Not waterproof!,"It's not water proof and it rusts on the inside. The turning head is a nice feature, but I don't think I really needed it."
1,old and out of date,Was a good book in it's time but is out of date now.Don't waste your money. The up to date Black and Decker is probably great.
1,"Condition is very bad , But they just said scraches it is more than that",Thisis only item i am un happy with amazon.com. Head phones are in very bad shape. They also damageed right head phone.
2,no more leaks,"I have used Pampers Baby Dry on my son for several months now and have been very pleased. For reference, my son is in the 90th percentile for height and weight for his age. These Pampers fit him well and we have had no leaks, though this may not be the case for a baby with a different build. In comparison, I have also tried:1. Huggies Pure & Natural, which shed lint all over my baby's bottom;2. Huggies Snug & Dry, which also shed lint in addition to leaking at night;3. Pampers Sensitive, which is also a great diaper that I used for his first few months. It is just more expensive and we no longer needed the ""sensitive"" option.Overall, Pampers Baby Dry are great. The only downside is that the tabs can sometimes rub the thighs. Pampers has remedied this by adding ""wings"" to the front sides to protect chubbier thighs from the plastic tabs. Additionally, with Amazon's Subscribe & Save, these diapers are very economical."
2,review BF,Excellet service on receiving this book and it is perfect!It was received very quickly and in excelent condition.Pricing was also great. Keep up the good work.
1,Unable to Review,"Unfortunately, I have to say that I am very very disappointed with this order. I ordered this book on Sept 2 for my daughter to read and write a report about for school. (Report is due Oct 25) and to date, October 9, I have NOT RECEIVED it yet. When I contacted the vendor to report last week, I basically received a ""sorry for your luck, but once it leaves our hands, we really don't care"" type of response. Totally not impressed."
2,Bloody Brilliant !,"Was introduced to the lads by my daughter, Lindy. They performed in Cheyenne, Wyo last summer (looks like they'll be back this year too (can you see me smiling? ) I saw them last September in Estes Park, and they are brilliant ! Their upbeat numbers will get your feet tapping, your hands clapping and your heart pounding. My favourite, however, is a much slower one: Men of Erin,, it'll give you goose bumps and bring a tear to your eye,,,, We love ya, lads,,,, Slainte !"
1,Awful. Too many typos to even read!!!!!!,With almost two dozen typos per page this version of Aron's Rod was completely unreadable. Not just typos but many of the sentences were incomplete. I found out to my frustration that it was too late to return the book. In frustration I simply threw the book away. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PUBLISHER. I wish someone would have warned me about this.
2,SIMPLY EXCELLENT,"This is an excellent corpus of translations from an authoritative hand, including from simple ""funeral"" and ""biographical"" inscriptions from the Old Kingdom upto nice and good renderings of all the major ""tales"" and ""stories"" from the MIddle Kingdom: The Tale of Sinuhe, The Dialogue between a Man and His Soul, the Tale of Kheops and the magicians, and many other paramount titles of the ancient Egyptian literature dated to the aforesaid periods. Each piece contains an introductory notes with the ""history"" of the documents and end-notes full of interesting comments as for the translation's details and plenty of bilbiography. Most recommended, both for the beginners and the trained readers."
2,AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!,"I was really looking forward to an RPG for the Lord of the Rings, and, well, this isn't it. It's really dissappointing--the story is killed with absolutely NO drama, the music is skimpy and barely playing, and there are almsot no fights. Not that it should be a problem because it's a bare-bones system, with extreme difficulty, slow moving enemies, and confusing mechanics. To make the game even worse, you wander aimlessly through repeating areas to look for an ""item"" that helps you progress through. Although that's not a bad thing for many GBA games such as Castlevania, you'll spend pointless hours searching for an item so you could pass to the next area with the same system. It's gotten old, and this game does it poorly. So get the Two Towers game from EA Games (for PS2, GC, and XBox) and get a much, much better game with an excellent amount of action."
1,Thank god they were given a 2nd chance after this one,"Loved ""whats the story.."" so recently 4/05 got this CD. I cant believe its the same band. DM is boring and whiny and I can hardly listen to it all the way through. ""whats the story.."" is so much more inspired and less nasaly. Im glad I didnt hear it first or I never would have gotten the 2nd one. Music isnt that good either"
2,three's company,this is one of the best comedy ever in the world tv until now i am still watching this comedy every time
1,Gave a rash,The baby dry diapers left a rash on my baby. Not a diaper rash another kind of rash. I will never use these again.
2,Perfect,I bought this to go with my SD700IS because I wanted to keep it all oem and just as the one that came with the camera I have to admit I have never seen a battery last longer I have had the camera for almost 4 months now and between the 2 batteries I have only charged both 1 time and believe me I use my camera allot!
2,"Great price, works just as well as the Apple version","Bought this as a replacement for my ibook charger. Its about $40 cheaper than the apple proprietary version and does the same exact thing -> power my laptop. Its not as fancy looking, however, and the cord is kind of stiff. But if you dont care about that sort of stuff then there is no reason to buy the overpriced apple version."
1,Must Have Been John Austin,"This is the first book I have ever purchased on Amazon that I had to return. It seemed to have been written by a man, there was not one scene that did not include some type of phallus. I am a fan of Victorian tales and classic from writers like Jane Austin, this book seemed to be written by someone from modern times trying to speak with the syntax and semantics of Victorian times. I would not recommend this collection to anyone who likes sensual and sexual play between women. There were some scenes with incest and rape. I did not get very far in this book, about the first 5 stories, in an attempt to find something worth my time. I returned the book the very next day after receiving it in the mail.Take a look at it in a book store before you purchase it to varify my words."
2,Both my daughter and son enjoyed this book.,"It's not overly long, and it's written in simple enough language that my 8 and 9 year old children had no trouble reading it.It's a very engaging, sweet story, which introduces the concepts of chivalry and bravery. I actually think this book is very good for boys to read - it's about knights and fighting for one's honor, and demonstrating loyalty, but it's also about being able to cry when you need to, and being able to express love for others.In this story, the little boy's nanny is moving away, because he's growing up and doesn't need her, and he has some trouble accepting this. I think it's a wonderful, simple way to address some of the issues all children face when approaching their teenage years.I definitely recommend this one to parents and children."
1,Paper feed nightmare,"Like so many others, hard to believe this ever made itthrough HP QA - I end up hand feeding many, failure over75% of the time!!! Find another machine."
1,Some errors in book - disappointed,"The book is okay, but there are some errors. Chapter 7, page 123, says that ""Protein synthesis begins with the transcription process"". This becomes a quiz question at the end of Chapter 7, but according to the quiz key in the book, the answer ""transcription"" is incorrect. Also, quiz question number 1 at the end of Chapter 7 also appears to give an incorrect answer (according to the quiz key). Also, there seem to be more inconsistencies. So I am disappointed. Otherwise, if it weren't for these errors, this could be a great book - a five star instead of a two star."
2,"""Your God is Too Small"" will lift your spirits","This has been a favorite of mine since it first came out. J. B. Phillips is a Bible scholar who writes in a way a lay person can grasp his meaning. ""Your God Is Too Small"" has helped to mold my idea of a loving, inclusive God. I would say this book played a big part in making me a better Christian. I recommend it for Youth and up. Amust have in Christian publications."
2,"I was lost, and then with Emanuel, I was found...","This book saved my grade in Constitutional Law. A week before the final I was so confused and lost in the material and I was freaking out! I bought this book as a last hope at saving my grade, and not only did it save my grade, I got one of the best grades in the class!! This is the BEST supplement I have seen yet that explains and ties everything together. I would recommend it a thousand times over to all law students who need a little (or a lot) of help with Constitutional Law."
2,More than just John Wayne.,It was funny to see Shirley Temple in her teens. lol I have several movies of her as a little girl and now I have one with her as a young woman.
2,Another fun Rudy Maxa DVD,"We have enjoyed all of the Rudy Maxa DVD travel series, especially in BluRay. The programs help when viewed prior to travel and are most enjoyable post-travel. Rudy captures and best of every location. He also enjoys food and beverage, which we appreciate in our household."
1,Struggling to find fresh meat,"Here's how to make a good idea go bad in about 300 pages: sloppy and repetitive writing, careless characterization, zombies that aren't scary, and a story that shambles around as aimlessly as one of the undead it describes.For an example of this, see David Moody's 'Autumn,' a book which starts out strong, promising a fresh spin on the zombie story but delivering something stale and dull.I'll say this much - it's refreshing to read a first book in a series and be left with no desire to continue reading the rest. Life's too short to read bad books, and 'Autumn' was enough for me."
1,I so wanted to love this item,"Was very comfortable when I inflated it, but had deflated twice before the night was over. Boasts features like beds twice the price -- the internal 120 AC pump is handy (especially since it deflates so fast) but it is noisy,and who wants to interrupt their sleep twice a night to reinflate the bed? Not me, that's for sure. I really wish it hadn't been a leaker, I like this bed, everything about it except that."
1,Not Really Accurate,"I had thought that this book and the sample Exam on the CD would be a realy close reflection of the exam content. But whan I took the exam, it didn't seem like that was the case. The book and sample exam seemed to focus on Admin. stuff while the exam seemed to emphasize SQL, TSQL and database design a lot more. I also don't think the book prepares you for security-related questions very well. But it might still be worthwhile for someone who feels ready to take the exam and just wants some practice."
2,great!,"I bought this for a narrow entry tiled shower. It was very hard to find a tension bar that would work for my 26"" shower opening - not to mention I wanted a nickel or chrome finish. The bar fits snugly, but is not as heavy as I had hoped. It hold a thin shower curtain very well, but would not hold up to a heavier curtain. Perfect for my use/"
1,"Doesn't keep the coffee hot, don't bother trying this one.","I've read the reviews and disagree with most of them. The coffee will not stay hot, luke warm at best."
2,Indelible impact,Sea Runners will etch the coastline of British Columbia in your mind. An awesome tale.
2,larry levan definitive salsoul mixes,let me start by saying i am a massive fan so my thoughts are one sided okbut if you can lay your hands on this cd do it stand out tracks wellthey all stand out but instant funk crying bunny sigler by the way you dance & of course inner life aint no mountain high enough & sparkle handsome manif you are serious about quality dance music it doesnt get much better than this collectionits not easy or cheap to find but get it & play it for someone not aware of this music i assure you they will find something in this to move them its worked for me
2,Great Cover - if you can get your Bible into it,"My wife purchased this Bible cover for me as a birthday present. I had wanted this over anything else since my existing was falling apart. My Bible is a NAS Inductive Study Bible. And it is big Bible. But the XL, the largest cover they make, did not come anywhere close to fitting it. I really like this cover, but if it doesn't fit, it will do you no good."
1,Discovery Atlas:Italy Revealed,"When I selected the DVD Discovery Atlas: Italy Revealed, I anticipated a visual tour of Italy's major cities. Instead, it is the story of a goup of people challenged to achieve personal goals. The DVD focuses on the personal struggles and objectives, which frankly I am not interested! The cinematography is beautiful, and Isabella Rossellini's voice is charming, soothing, and will put you to sleep."
2,It came alive,"Yes, I have read the OT before but never like this. Thank you for writing this book. Now all I have reciting over and over in my heart is "" hear oh Israel! YWHY is God! YWHY alone. :D"
1,Does not work as described in reviews,"I bought this over the lower priced version, based on reviews of people who were very happy with it. I was disappointed from day 1. It actually arrived in the mail and looked as though it was a return from someone else, as the plastic was lightly scratched on the surface.I turned it on and used it with a cup of fresh HOT coffee and it only stayed at a WARM temperature. This only kept my coffee slightly warm, right about the temperature you would go refill your coffee because it's getting cold.I will be returning this product."
1,it works....i guess,"This thing works sometimes, and its cheep. Other then that I don't have much good too say about it. It uses up the ink in the expensive cartridges like water. And is so noisy it sounds like a truck going off road. I've owned quite a few cheep HP ink jet printers, and I've been disappointed by them all. I am going with Epson or paying a little more for a higher model HP. In the print world, you get what you pay for and buying cheep is a bad idea."
2,Every counselor should have this book for reference,I purchased this book when I got a divorce. I knew it would be hard on my 5 year old and I wanted to give her as much support as I possibly could. This book was amazing in helping my daughter work thru issues. I am happy to say that she is fairly well adjusted and give this book partial credit. She is now 8 and this books still sits on her bookshelf for whenever she may need it.
2,More Mrs. Heelis than Beatrix Potter,"This is more a Heelis family history than a bio of Beatrix Potter. There are occasional mentions of Ms. Potter (or as she preferred to be called, Mrs. Heelis) but it does give you a relative's view of the well-known author. I enjoy family histories so I found it to be an interesting little book but if you're looking for a straight biography this may disappoint."
2,Amazing book on Life!,"When Reich wrote this book in the early 50's He was supposed to have gone mad. After a first read of the book, you will find He was unusually lucid, much more than Nietzsche himself in the account of a Life ruling principle.Do not be afraid of any comment. Just enjoy reading it!"
2,Great Rick Astley songs!,"First of all, I just want to add my 2 cents here....gosh, what is up with some of these *BITTER* reviewers below? If you arent an 80's music fan, please do not post here. grrrr. Anyway, this is an awesome essential rick astley cd. All his US hits are here....even the ones that didnt get as much radio time such as ""It would take a strong, strong man"". Great cd. I also suggest Howard Jones greatest cd since I tend to group these solo British artists together."
1,Object-Oriented C++ Data Structures for Real Programmers,"This book has some good concepts and approach to the subject, but the examples have just too many errors, and some errors even cause system exceptions when you run them. Furthermore the author's web side, which is supposed to keep track of the errata, has no records of any errors reported. I personally sent notice of some errors, but received no response.It is just too frustrating to attempt to learn a subject with examples that do not work, a book that has no support after you purchased it, and the author's web site does not report or respond to its readers. Find something else."
2,Got a Laptop? You'll need the Lapinator/Mousitizer,"I got my wife one of these 2-3 years ago but I always used my laptop on a desk until recently. If I had paid attention to her use of the Lapinator with Mousitizer, I would have gotten one a long time ago. The lap table has space for my 17"" laptop and a clip-on USB LED light. The Mousitizer is what makes this combo work so well. The table itself insulates from the heat, and the Mousitizer fits snuggly to the table. I think the optional rubber bumper border is a must to block your wireless mouse from falling off at the slightest tilt of the table. I tried another laptop table brand that folds for travel, but at home I don't use anything but the Lapinator."
1,"The voice of the lord: a sermon preached in christ church, georgeton dc","It was unreadable, your could not read any page. However, Amazon refunded my money. Amazon is an amazing company, I buy all my books from Amazon."
2,Crazy about 8 Crazy Nights!,"This movie is awesome. It is the perfect movie for the holiday season. I am absolutely crazy about Whitey, the old man referee in the movie. Elenore and Davey are also hilarious! I love this movie and watch it over and over again with my whole family. Something you should buy because it is great!""Smell you later poopsicles!"" (A funny line from the best movie in the WORLD!!!)"
1,"No fun, no action, no good","I'm a 10 yead old boy who loves to read! but I totally hate this book. It was a summer reading assignament from school (4th grade). Nothing happens in 148 pages of boaring, repetitive and monotonus writing.They say things over and over again. This book is lable as an Eco mistery, but it seams to me like an encyclopedia type of reading. To much unnecesary information.I would not recomend this book at all."
2,This is a MUST have!!!,"We purchased this swingset for our 2 year old and he absolutely LOVES it! We love the fact that it is durable and safe. When our older son who is not 14 years old was little, we tried the fancy wooden fort type swingset andthe only thing we accomplished was spending a lot of money because the wood cracked and within 2 years it was junk. This swingset was made to last and will be around for a long time I think."
1,Doesn't do timeshifting with my Mitsubishi,This product I got yesterday doesn't do all its features when connected to my Mitsubishi 62525. It seemed to work ok but when I actually tried to record something it would lose its connection. Will probably return it if I can't get it to be stable this weekend.
2,Helpful in early pregnancy,"I am using this pillow now and about to enter my second trimester. I find the pillow to be comfortable and useful in training myself to sleep on my side. I actually find the pillow most comfortable upside down (with the connected piece at my feet). This allows me to use the side bolsters, elevate my feet, AND use my own pillow."
2,Great desk and a great buy! Thanks Amazon:),We bought this desk for my seven year old daughter to keep her lap top on and to do homework. It was not to disappoint. The desk is perfect size for her to sit and work. Very high quality and easy to put together. I would highly recommend this product to others?
1,Does not run on some DVD players,"I can run the DVD on a laptop computer, but it will not run on a 2011 DVD player or a 2009 DVD player."
1,Flimsy and incoherent.,"Incoherent thriller that has Keanu Reeves in full matrix mold and making a complete fool out of himself with a pretty bad script. His performance is not very good and he's miscast for the role he is in. The other actors in the film, most noticeable Rachel Weisz ( She does give the best performance in this movie, she is that good), Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton all do better than poor Keanu in there roles and manages to rise above some of the cliches and the flimsy plot to give solid performances but not even they can get pass the fact of how badly this film was made and how incoherent it really is. For their performance alone, the movie gets a star from me but don't expect much from the movie itself."
2,Buy It Now!,"Everyone should have this game. It is the perfect game for families because adults enjoy it as much as the kids. Even young kids can play, because there is no reading, just pictures on the dice. You start with some wooden mice and roll the dice to see if you put one in the cat bowl, take one from the bowl, pass one or do nothing. You never know who is going to win until the end, because even if you run out of mice early, there is a chance someone might have to pass you their's. The last person with mice wins. We have played games where only two people had a mouse at the end, but neither of them won because they had to pass them to other players. The game is small, easy to learn and a lot of fun. Buy it now, you'll be glad you did."
1,WTF is this?!,"Real words, unlike what you'd find in this book, cannot describe what you find in here. This book is the bane of my existence. James Joyce must have self-inflicted mercury poisoning in order to write this. The only other plausible explanation is that he became severely mentally retarded from a lack of flow of oxygen to the brain. If you want to actually understand anything, you have to read explanations EVERY ""sentence"". This turns it into a f'n time vampire. It is terrible in every aspect - there are no plot, characters, situations, comedy, horror, storyline, or anything else that books usually consist of. If the author came back to life, became unretarded, and then read his own book again, he would instantly want to drown himself in Lake Michigan. I award him no stars and may God have mercy on his soul."
2,Realistic Tree,This Xmas tree is a very lifelike and realistic tree and is just what we wanted for our living room! The lights on it are beautiful and the pine cones are a great added effect. Can't wait to put the presents underneath!
2,Best Rice cooker around,"If you eat rice then this is the cooker for you. The best feature, aside from the even cooking, is the timer that allows you to say when you want the rice done."
2,One of my favorite books as a kid.,"This ought to be required reading for every boy or girl between the ages of 8-12. Enjoyable, readable, exciting, and above all, heart-warming."
2,Charlie Brown delights as always,"The new blu ray version of A Charlie Brown Christmas is excellent. The colors are superb, the sound too. And none of the original charm is lost. Highly recommended."
1,"Great Discussion Book, Bad Airplane Book","I think that Mr. Marquez is a far superior story teller than he is a writer. It is too bad you can't sit around a fire listening to his stories instead. This book basically has no overall plot, but many smaller plots for each little story within it. I thought the sheer number of characters who names were similar (if not the same) was very annoying. I had a hard time connecting with any of the characters due to the weaving in and out of other characters. I know that there was a family tree in the beginning, but I just got tired of flipping back to the point that I just did not care.To the average reader, without a discussion group or a literary expert, many of the ""hidden gems"" will be missed if there are any. On the whole, I just couldn't shake the vibe that I was reading an extended version of the Old Man and the Sea.It was interesting from the point of reading a Mexican writer."
2,It's all true!,"If I hadn't already seen them live a couple of years ago, I would swear this was studio magic. But it's not, just one of the greatest bands ever, and the best live band I have ever heard! Buy this, you will not be disappointed. I bought it for the Blu Ray, and it is stunning. Video and Audio is breath taking. Enjoy!"
1,A Disappointment,"I am a professional player and teacher with students ranging from beginner to adult.First the good things: the book has songs that not represented on prior play-alongs, including ""Harlem Nocturne"" ,""Opus One"" and ""Bernie's Tune"". Plus, the players involved are quite good. This book could be useful for helping a beginner (to jazz) develop feel, at least in playing melodies.However, the flaws are pretty severe. Most songs have only 1 chorus of improvisation, some less. On ""Harlem Nocturne"" and ""Desafinado"", the solos are less than 12 bars TOTAL. Next, some arrangements are poor. ""A Night In Tunisia"" does not include the interlude before the break. ""Harlem Nocturne"" does not include the interval pattern at the end of the bridge.Again, this title might have a little value for a beginning jazz player to follow the melodies in an appropriate style. I can't recommend this to anyone else. There are better play-alongs out there."""
1,Next time read the item description Edgardo,"This is not a book so much as a bunch of quotes made by Tozer, put together in a way to look pretty and make the publisher some $$ off people like me who love Tozer's works. There is nothing of value here. Read the Pursuit of God by Tozer if you you want something to challenge you and guide you, not this."
2,one of the best debuts ever.,a few things:1. the beatles are my favorite band ever.2. this does not sound like the beatles. people who say it mimics them or trys to imitate them are just lazy reviewers. noel does steal his fair share past brit rockers though.3.it's up there for me with van halen I and appetite with destruction as the best debut's ever. it's just pure rock n' roll with great vocals and loud guitars.4. this is oasis' best album. the vocals are better in morning glory and the songs are more mainstream but this one is jamming.
1,NOT HAPPY WITH SCALE INNACCURATE,"I'm a large guy, and I just weighed in at DOCTOR at 346, he said ""Lose weight."" I got this scale to track my weight, set it up and guess what in less that a week, I'm 306, that's 38 pounds off the doctors scale. UNless these people call me to correct this complaint, I got RIPPED OFF BY DETECTO. What it detects is INNACURASY.VERY UNHAPPY, DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Not what I was hoping for...,"This simple game works exactly as stated: players take turns pushing the teeth in until the jaw snaps shut. However, I was disappointed at how small and cheap this game is. It's about as large as an adult's hand and seems like it could break very easily. I would've felt better about this size and quality level if it would have cost about half the amount I paid."
2,"Great Songs, Great Messages","this Cd is great and has some truthful messages. i like ""Deer Dance"" its about brutal police and is a great metal song.another one is ""Prison Song"" its about how america has too many priaons and is true, treatment should be increased, and law enforcement decreased. this is a great CD from a great band, buy it today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,one sigma handbook,"This book came with six pages of Errata. Even with that, I still found multiple mistakes throughout the book. This book about Six Sigma was written on the one sigma level. I would not recommend this book to anybody. You cannot trust this book!"
2,Good product.,"I ordered the same size 2 months ago. It was good. Now, this is my 2nd time order. Good product. As expected!"
2,Measure of a Man,"Clay Goes Beyond!Beyond anything you heard on AI, Clay shows his real talent. 'The Way' gave me goosebumps in the same way that his rendition of 'This is the Night' did when I first heard him sing it. Hopefully, he is hear to stay. I love his voice. If you stumble a bit on the first song, keep listening. It is the only one that is tentative in my opinion."
1,WIMPY!!,"Sorry Clay, I kept an open mind...but this CD is a corny, wimpy collection of out-dated pop. Clay should have stayed the red-haired, freckle-faced, 4-eyed christian singer that he once was. They have turned him into to a blonde, spiky haired howdy doody. My friends and I say......""CLAY NO WAY""!!!!!"
2,Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"I've only had it for less than 2 weeks, and have to buy another one because I've scratched it taking it between the car and house. You have got to get this cd if you haven't already! Number 9, 10, and second part of 11 are my favorites."
1,Worst Album by the Crowes,"I bought this album that day it came out, listened to it twice and put it on my cd rack severely disappointed. Every two years since, I grab the CD thinking, ""Hey, it's the Crowes, it can't be -that- bad"". And every time, I put it back on the shelf.It come down to this, if you like the Black Crowes and don't have this album, don't buy it. I read all the press when this came out. The album was supposed to be a return to their early days (ala Shake Your Moneymaker). In my opinion, Moneymaker is good, but not nearly as good as Southern Harmony and Amorica. Although By Your Side has the Shake vibe, it is at best secondhand rehash of that album.In reading the positive reviews about this album, I have to think the authors aren't normally Crowes fans. This album sounded like a hollow attempt to reclaim radio glory. If you like radio rock, it might be for you. If you think the Crowes are best when they are experimenting and grooving (ala Amorica) stay away from this one."
2,Great,"This bed is great, compact and comfortable. We've had guests who use it ask us where we got it because they want to buy it too."
2,MOAM is Wonderful,"Mr. Aiken has a phenomenal voice. There is no ""skippable"" song on this CD at all--they are all spectacular. My wife and I both love the CD and highly recommend it."
2,OFF THE CHAIN,THIS CD IS OFF THE CHAIN. THESE ARE THE SONGS THAT I HAVENT HEARD IN A LONG TIME. WHEN I SAW THIS CD I HAD TO GET IT THIS CD IS AWESOME. IF YOU LOVE THE VIP MASS CHOIR THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD. ALL OF THE SONGS ARE GREAT. I KNEW MOST OF THEM ANYWAYS BUT IT WAS STILL GREAT TO HAVE THIS CD. YOU NEED TO GET THIS CD IF YOU LOVE JOHN P KEE
1,"Big fan of Adams, but this book ...","I am a big fan of Dougles Adams books, at least in general.But this book is, at best, only marginally funny. Others have explored this topic, and with better results.The problem here is that Adams tries to make funny sounding words for things that don't have a name (like that little twist between link sausages), but constrains himself to using the names of small cities and towns from around the world. Occasionally, he hits a home run, but most of the words are strike outs.Disapointed.PS the 'name' for the link between sausages is kerry. Why, I don't know, and I have no idea why some think this is humorous."
1,Horrible CD,"I bought this CD thinking it was a ""Best Of"" or ""greatest Hits"" type thing. It is far from that to be sure. Sure there are alot of songs here but they are all old demo's or just poorly recorded live stuff from garage practices & small clubs. Maybe I'm just too jaded, but the sound quality was horrible. I mean I was disapointed in it not being studio recordings in the 1st place. But in this day & age you should be able to go in & clean the really poor sound quality up a bit before packaging it up & selling it to the general public. It basicly sounds like it was recorded usuing a portable cassette tape player, & a cheap one at that! I'm gonna see if I can get some fool to actually give me some money for this piece of trash on Ebay, but I doubt it."
1,Don't waste your time,"It's amazing how they can take some moments from a film, show them in previews, and make a person think, ""Hey, that looks interesting."" Well, don't you believe it! It felt as if they were making the plot up as they went along, the characters are shallow, and it was BORING. I don't know anything about the comic, but if I were the original artist/author, I'd be offended that my name was associated with this movie. It's not scary, it's not interesting, it's not thought provoking, there's nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat. Save your money."
1,Heavy Handed,"Candide may have been something in its day, but as a modern reader only marginally versed/interested in 18th century France, I found reading it to be rather dull. (Before I get comments about how I'm stupid, I would like to point out that although I sometimes like to read classics for fun, my career and focus has always been in the sciences)Like other satires I've read, Candide seemed heavy-handed and flat. The philosophy of optimism is silly! Absurd things happen! Cue another character who only stands for symbols and has no real personality!This is why I don't read satire very often.I gave this two stars rather than one because I recognize that one may potentially get a chuckle out of the some of the ridiculous situations, and that someone more well acquainted with the particular philosophies may find Voltaire's criticism more entertaining. And it only took one day to read, which I suppose is a mark in its favor as well."
2,most favorite,"almost all brand diapers we tried,this is the best,good price,over night protection,'soft,no red rash ever.love this product,will come againand the 30%off is great deal"
1,"Tried to like it, but bad music ruined it.","It was kind of an interesting film, but I found the music boring and monotonous. Some of you have good points about the technical merits and originality, but I just could not get past the music, so for me it was not enjoyable. If the director and producer both had tin ears, there are millions of cheap, underpaid musicians in the world. Or just leave some of the more obnoxious music out.Germany/Austria has given so much great music to the world: Mahler, Brahms, Schumann, Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, Handel, Bach, to name a few. It's a shame that this movie from Germany could not do better.The characters were difficult to identify with. Maybe that was intentional. It was difficult for me to understand why Lola cared about her worthless boyfriend.I have never rated a movie this low before, but there are some worse films than this. It would have been a decent movie if they had taken the care not to ruin it."
2,Good stuff,"No problems whatsoever... it came in fast, with no defects and held up really well in the wash!"
2,Leaves of Grass,"Having read only tid bits, here and there, from Leaves of Grass, I found that it was full of truly unique American poetry. Whitman definitely achieved his goal of becoming a truly innovative poet. The fact that he rarely uses any type of meter, rhyme scheme, or exaggerated rhetorical devices almost says that he has mastered the basic fundamentals of poetry and surpassed his peers. He is so far above the simple and frequently used methods that he must create his own fresh and new style of writing. I found Leaves of Grass to be a lot to grapple with as a high school student, especially his philosophy pertaining to Deism, and yet, it was most intriguing and made me want to simply delve deeper into it. I look forward to completing Leaves of Grass and recommend it to anyone looking for truly original forms of American poetry."
2,An Overlooked Classic,"There's no doubt that ""Till We Have Faces"" is Lewis' most profound book. Its prose is masterful: spare, stark, the best writing Lewis ever did. He creates memorable, fully human characters, especially in Orual, daughter of Trom King of Glome. She is ugly, brutalized by her father, friendless until love enters her life through two characters: her Greek slave tutor and her youngest sister, Psyche. The novel becomes an examination of loves true and false, of manipulation of love, and of the power of grace to redeem and love the unloved and unlovely. I've read this novel at least a dozen times; it never grows stale. You needn't know the original myth to enjoy the book. I only wish more readers knew about this book--even many Lewis fans are unaware of this one. It will move your heart and make you think."
2,Importance of nubmer 12,"Well, after reading the book the first time I was amazed how the number 12 is repeated during the history. The book is quite interesting ..."
2,JUST GREAT,"So it was long, and it was a slow read, big DEAL. Ms Lackey and cohorts have spun a gripping, involved tale of GREAT characters, involved PLOTTING and lots of FUN. I read for pleasure and this was a pleasure. I was always looking back to keep things straight, but it was FUN. I lost most of two nights sleep because I couldn't put it down. This team should write lots of sequels, and I WILL BUY THEM ALL.Be warned, if you pick up this book and start reading you will suffer. Yours friends and family will think you have run away, and you have, To Venice, where you can spend a ripping vacation in you mind. The lady has won me back."
2,One of the best albums I own,"These guys are really really freaking good, and even better in concert. Normally, with a lot of CD's, if you listen to the whole thing a couple of times, you pick out songs you like more than others, and are able to narrow down your playlist to the ""better"" tracks on the album. Not so with The Matches. After roughly 9 months worth of listening, I am still hard-pressed to pick out a ""best"" song on it, because they're all really good. This would have to be one of the best punk CD's I own. Download the free mp3's on their website, and listen to them. If you like the samples, then you'll love this CD too."
2,Meatier hooks than a slaughterhouse,"This rocks in a real r-n-r kinda way. I don't remember why I bought this, but I'm glad I did. Thick-n-crunchy (w/o any silly metal nonsense)."
1,A Bit Preachy,"This is primarily Grey's diatribe and condemnation of the lack of support of returning WWI combat veterans. A historical note: Those vets received no benefits and more than 200,000 U.S. soldiers suffered physical or mental injuries during The Great War, but in 1919 only 217 had completed rehabilitation programs. That sad chapter has similarities with the Walter Reed Hospital scandal over substandard treatment of U.S. troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan.Bless Grey for taking up the cause back in the day, it must not have been very popular to do so at the time, but it got weary hearing one of the primary characters wax on and on about that issue. In addition, I had a real problem with the ending...suffice to say it would not have played out that way. He wrote better books."
1,a disgrace to religion,"although this book was an intentional attack on organized religion of the past, i thought that it went to far in trying to humor the audience. In light of this book being fiction, Pratchett still wanders a little far into even joking about something that is as important to millions of people as a supreme power.even so, the comedy good throughout. the characters were a little shallow at times, and my own obsession with imagery in fantasy novels (see Guy Gavriel Kay), made me feeling a bit disappointed in such a huge phenomenon as Terry Pratchett."
1,!!!! Wrong MP3 files !!!!,The MP3 files downloadable from this site are not for Parsifal but Verdi's Traviata. Amazon needs to fix this urgently.
1,Good but frustrating,"This book deals with the ever fascinating subject of prophesies, the vatican church, and corrupt officials. The book does not have a good grip on the suspense it tries to create, but actually aggravates the reader, and frustrates him. The plot is different from the usual 'Da Vinci Code' type books, but it could have been handled much more efficiently. In all, this book is good for reading, but is definitely not a keeper."
1,Have not received my item in a month.,"My order was placed on August 28, but I have not received the printer in a month."
1,Horrible diapers,"I did not like these diapers at all! They leaked at night and even during the day. As soon as my 10 month old daughter peed in them, these diapers hung to the knees."
2,Price is right and it is a good stock replacement,There isn't much to say. It's a quality replacement for the thrifty buyer. Don't go to the dealership when you can just buy one of these.
1,OOOOOMMMMMMMM,"Buy this at a discount price, it's not something you want to buy for $14.00 at a music store."
2,I love Amazon.,Pampers are great. Pampers from Amazon are better. I ordered in bulk and needed a larger size faster than I thought. Amazon picked up the unopened boxes from my house and credited my card. I then ordered the correct size. Great customer service.
2,Works great with my Sony DCR-TRV103 video camera to Sony VaioPC,"works great! so easy to use with ""click to DVD"" software that came on my Sony Vaio PC. love it! I can finally have my home videos put on DVD easily, in about an hour or so."
2,Coltrane Supreme,"Absolutely outstanding, many words have been written about this man but he and Miles Davis stand alone as the giants of the original modern jazz era. What ever you want to call it, bebop, classic jazz or a new definitive sound that started to emerge during the 50's. It hit you smack in the face when the 1960's arrived. Yes a wonderful piece of work."
2,Can't get enough of those wonderful Simpsons - D'oh!,"This collection is absolutely hilarious and more than a must for any Simpsons-enthusiast. It contains Bart the Daredevil - Itchy, Scratchy and Marge - Two cars in every garage and 3 eyes on every fish [Blinky] - Bart vs. Thanksgiving - Tree House of Horror - Bart gets an F. Bart sez: Ay Carumba - Get it man or eat my shorts!"
2,Anastasia Rocks,The CD is great. Every song has its own personality and that makes the entire CD very diverse. I especially love the mixes on the second disc.
1,The Worst Movie Ever!,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen! The plot was impossible to follow, the action confusing and flashy, and the film editing awful. For example, there is one sequence in which a motorcycle crashes through a chain link fence and the sound effect boingongong is heard, like a spring snapping. Ridiculous! Concept - Terrible, Acting - Worse, Execution - Rollerball looks like it was made in 2 weeks using 2 computers that didnt work. I reccommend that you see this movie, just so you can tell your friends you've seen the worst movie ever made!"
2,An amazing voice...,I knew we had a winner the first time I heard his voice in the auditions. This CD is amazing and I listen to it constantly. I just hope he has another listen to all year CD coming out soon.
2,weird stuff,"Dredge is different from anyone I've heard yet. I can't Tell what this guy is singing about. By far Dredge has some of the most modern, but beautiful music out. Young musicians. you can call it emo maybe. evn if you hate emo check this album out. I bought it knowing nothing about it. Bug Eyes is fantastic, even though I have no idea what it means."
1,False Advertisement,"The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied."
1,Unbelievably Stupid,"How on earth this film ever generated the amount and degree of attention it did is one of most astonishing curiosities in movie history. Virtually every aspect of the film is risible. In fact, you can probably enjoy it purely for its innumerable unintentioned laughs. Marlon Brando gives what can only be described as one of the messiest and shameful performances that any formerly great actor could conceive (worse even than Vito Corleone or Kurtz). And clever Bertolucci shovels on enough pretentious artiness and pseudo-eroticism to steam up an academic's glasses. Everyone else will merely catch themselves yawning most of the time."
2,Believe in Atomic Dog,"Clinton's contributions to popular music are practically limitless; perhaps most importantly, he kept waving his freak flag high long after most musicians caved in to their labels' demand for conformity. Computer Games showcases his talent for squeezing archetypal beats and riffs out of his ever-changing cadre of musicians. Even though it was released in 1982, it still feels as fresh as tomorrow's flavor du jour. Try to keep from playing ""Where did I hear that sampled?"" and just let the funk wash you up and away to Clinton's psychedelic, sexed-up Disneyland. Every track's a winner."
2,TiVo Wireless Adapter,Pros:Works amazing! Love it. Uses wireless internet connection to upload the show times and titles.Highly suggest this product if your looking for a wireless adapter for your TiVo.Was a plug and play periphrial. Plug it in and your Series2 TiVo finds it right away.Great product and experience. Much like every TiVo product I own.Cons:The price seems a little steep but not too bad because it works like a charms
1,nothing of value,"It will make me unpopular to say this, as if I am not already wildly unpopular, but this was a terrible and totally overrated movie. In light of Marlon Brando's semi-recent death I thought it high time to see some of his best known works. Cited as a classic in many cases, at least for being raunchier than anything else at the time of its release, this film was flat, left me dazed, it was useless. I hated it. It was strange, mumbling, sleazy. The acting-particularly from Maria Schneider-if you could call it acting, anyway-was mediocre at best. Where's the story? This just strikes me as a film made at the time to push the envelope of what was considered ""art"" and ""decent"". To me, it was just a monumental waste of time, like roughly half of Bernardo Bertolucci's work."
2,A Scary Preview of the future of American Society,"I first read this book after my mother, a senior english teacher, was getting ready to have her students read Farenheit 451. I immediately fell in love with the book. In the almost 10 years since I fist read the book, I have read it over and over again. While in college, I wrote a paper for a Lit class showing the how Bradbury's science fiction is slowly becoming science fact (i.e. seashells= walkman. Its scary to see how a book written in 1953, as a work of fiction, is becoming reality. If you want to know what I mean, then read ""Farenheit 451"" and see for yourself. It is a definite eye opener that sends chills thorugh my body everytime I read it."
2,CLAY AIKEN ROCKS!,"I bought this cd along with clay aiken's single Solitaire last week. He has voice of an angel and I love how articulate he is when he sings with such passion from his heart and soul. WOW don't miss this one, he is awesome."
2,"So human, so hot","Vickery is certainly the best multi-dimensional male erotic fiction writer today. He is the Anne Rice of [homosexual] male porn.But even more, the humanity and spirituality of his characters [comes] through clearly - their pain, their joy, their search, their honesty, the lies, the hopes, the hot , out-of-control passion - everything else human. I was moved to tears, and compassion, and much, much more. Hot, hot, hot."
2,Excellent modern day horror film,"Realistic 1960's horror film filled with great performances by an ensemble cast. I felt this was one of Roman Polanski's best directed films. Well written script leaves the viewer wondering until the final few minutes whether or not the central character is truly a victim or simply paranoid. Dialogue closely follows Ira Levin's novel. Unfortunately, younger viewers used to special effects or gore may be put off or bored by the lack of both. Horror and tension is created instead with dialogue and the viewer's imagination."
2,the nay-sayers are nuts,"I've been reading SF for just over 65 years. My SF library runs to 1800 volumes. While Empire From the Ashes may have been one of Weber's early works, it simply sparkles with imagination. If you don't enjoy it, find another genre to read. He has grown greatly in the conversations between characters (in Safehold, they are amazingly good), but they are just fine in the Dahak trio. I have recently finished reading Asamov's Foundation pentology (including the Robot inclusions) and six of Heinlein's best. Neither of them can touch Weber's attention to detail, and INTELLIGENT conversations between characters who are at the top of Safehold's heirarchy and therefore intelligent. The monologues are so good they can bring an unexpected lump in the throat. If all you want is car-chase type reading, you may skip pages, but if you want a brilliant read from a great SF writer, Weber is your guy."
1,Defective version of great story,"As others have pointed out, this version is missing critical portions that totally ruin one of the greatest mysteries in the English language. Free is generally good, but not in this case."
2,"Alright, but sort of weird","Ray Bradbury's book, Fahrenheit 451 is actually a pretty good book. I read it in seventh grade and I recommend it to anyone who likes books. Fahrenheit 451 has a very captivating plot and is pretty well written, but at some parts it got extremely confusing, especially at the part when Guy Montag's wife took too much drugs or something like that. I read that part over 50 times and I still didn't get it until I had to asked my brother."
1,Don't read this book unless you're forced to!,"Jeez, was this book strange! By looking at all these great reviews, I felt I had to add my opinion. Steinbeck's a talented writer, that's obvious from the first page. But it had no plot or anything.I guess you either love it or hate it."
2,A better read as an adult -- not a great choice for teenagers...,"Well-paced, surprisingly easy to follow despite the language used. I hadn't read it in 30 years, and found it to be much more palatable as an adult than it was when I was a teenager. There must be a lesson in there somewhere..."""
1,Cheaply made,Cheaply made and difficult for little hands to slide peek a boo parts. Wouldn't but it again. Not manufactured well-it looked old after just a few minutes of handling.
1,This is Disgusting,The German Pinscher is a wonderful Family pet and this type of comments makes them sound dangerous. I own 3 German Pinschers and they are wonderful pets. I resent this type of product.
1,Cheating,"David Weber uses a trick in this book that I think is cheating at writing, and not in a good way. One chapter ends with the main characters in dire straits, and then the next one starts with them having overcome the problem without any explanation. Did he get tired of writing or is he just inept?Otherwise I'd say that I would recommend the book to readers age 12-16. To an adult the characters seems a trifle ""fantastic""."
1,Amazon says 50 minutes,"while in fact it is only 25, as specified on the DVD. I am OK with the price I paid for 50 minutes. NOT for 25. If Amazon gave the right specs I would not have bought it. Now I cannot even return it, cause returning anything from Croatia is too expensive. So I am stuck with most expensive per-minute DVD in my collection. And the fact that I overpaid it is gonna be buggin me, and I'm gonna feel cheated for a long long time. Bad business, Amazon. Bad business. PS someone wrote 20 min in their review, 5 weeks after I ordered. Bummer."
1,"Awkward, Difficult and Arduous","THE PICTORIAL KEY TO THE TAROT: BEING FRAGMENTS OF A SECRET TRADITION UNDER THE VEIL OF DIVINATIONLadies and Gentlemen,This is the MOST DIFFICULT to read book I have ever purchased in my life (and I purchase a LOT of books.) The references the author uses are ambiguous; trying to follow his train of thought and LEARN something is like trying to lift mercury with a fork. There are several GOOD books on the Tarot here on Amazon. Please believe me when I tell you: you'll do better picking ANY ONE of them over this book. In fact; contact me and you can have this copy I purchased FOR FREE ~ and spare yourself an expensive lesson.I hope I don't appear too harsh nor vindictive. I don't write ""Book Reviews"" ~ ever. I only write this one to Spare You."
1,Misses the Mark,"I have to disagree with other reviewers who have heaped praise and many stars on this movie which I found to be art house at it's least pleasing. You will have seen words like, dark, brooding, disturbing thrown around like confetti, when in truth the movie simply does not deliver. What leaves an sour taste in the mouth is not the disturbed main character, nor the semi graphic sexual scenes, but mainly a very very compelling film that ends abruptly, if not predictably leaving the viewer feeling cheated. Is it well made? yes - well acted? sure - but like so many of these ""critically acclaimed"" dramas it's missing one vital thing. Most stories have a beginning, middle and an end - and this just leaves you hanging after nearly two hours, saying ""What?"""
1,Sometimes it works,"At first this printer worked well, but after a year it is nothing but trouble.To begin with, you can't print more than 4-5 pages before the ""page grabber"" will start to grab more than one sheet of paper at a time, and the text ends up going across both of them.Then there is the printer driver, which is also not up to par -- where is the manual two sided printing that has been in the classic Mac OS for all of these years?In short, this was my last HP printer. The jamming paper feed is too much for me to handle."
1,Designed for dwarfs,"Great fabric and tight fit. Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall, then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso. This company does not listen to the customer."
2,Apple G4 Power Cord,"I just bought my second one. We have 3 Macs at our house and the cords do not hold up. I dreaded replacing them but I like my computer. I tried this the last time my cord went and it worked great, so when the most recent power cord fell apart I did not hesitate. It does the same job at a third of the price!"
1,Old plots with very little action.,"Not for my taste. ""Stargate: Continuum"" has a very old plot that has been reused over and over again in both ""Stargate SG-1"" as well as in sci-fi stories in general. The first half is lacking in action, and you don't see much of O'Neill in this one. He shows up in the first few minutes of the film and the last few, but that's it. And the story is lacking in structure. The second half of the movie wasn't that bad, but still not worth wasting your money on.Not recommended!"
2,V.M-L7,"Of mice and men -As never before John steinbeck wrote the most integrated story.Lennie was a tall guy with a mind of baby.George was a small guy smart and quick.They were the best friend in the world.They dreamed of a great future but it was all just in their mind.Almost since Lennie was born George has been taking care of Lennie.Lennie Small could't get away from problems and also forget everything except his dreams of tending rabbits.I love this story .I thing it was one of the best book I ever read,because it teach me a lot about friendship and also I couldn't stop reading into the end."
1,He who doesnt laugh at this cd must have a hart of stone!,"This record discusted me, mr Sanders ought to think less about money and care more for the quality of the music! I mean, this man has played with Coltrane and obviously he didn't get it. Dont buy this cd, its popular music in its worst sense. Instead you should buy a record with John Coltrane. In his latet period he is in to the same themes as Sanders but shows that this doesnt necessarily lead to kitsch."
1,Missing substantial passages on Kindle version,"I would give this Sherlock Holmes story 5 stars, the low rating is due to the poor Kindle formatting. I know it is free but there are substantial passages missing... parts that are very important to the story... such as the actual legend of the Hound of the Baskerville. If you are truly interested in reading this story, there is a version that is only $1 to download and is complete."
2,Halo Series,This is an excellent read if you haven't already played the games. It's a great compliment to the Halo Game Series in that it provides more detail than what is presented in the games. This had a few spelling mistakes and mis-print/duplicate pages here and there.
2,Episode List,"In the second half of Season Six we continue to slip away from the early film noir feeling of this series, and more into a sixties flavor. The acting and writing are not at their peak. But Perry Mason is a great show no matter what. Here are the episodes:1. The Case of the Prankish Professor2. The Case of Constant Doyle - Bette Davis filling in for an absent Raymond Burr (who makes a short appearance on the phone, in his bathrobe)3. The Case of the Libelous Locked - Michael Rennie filling in for Raymond Burr4. The Case of the Two-Faces Turn-a-bout - Hugh O'Brien filling in5. The Case of the Surplus Suitor - Walter Pidgeon filling in6. The Case of the Golden Oranges - Perry is back!7. The Case of the Lawful Lazarus8. The Case of the Velvet Claws9. The Case of the Lover's Leap10. The Case of the Elusive Element11. The Case of the Greek Goddess12. The Case of the Skeleton's Closet13. The Case of the Potted Planter14. The Case of the Witless Witness"
1,Not for the serious minded..,"Perhaps the larger model works well. This smaller magnetic set is tragic. The only upside is that if you're working on your grip strength, these will probably help. To get a useable amount of pepper, you'll have to squeeze 15-20 times. They feel cheap and destined for a quick trip to the trash can. Stick with a tried and true twist grinder."
1,Most Dangerous Man Alive...Yeah right!,"To label Charles Manson ""The Most Dangerous Man Alive"" is a farce. He is now a rambling senile idiot/inmate stored away at San Quentin. He is better known as a prolific liar than a prolific writer. This book well written, therefore it could not have come from his words or hands. Then again, he has always used others to do his bidding via murder or writing. Believe what you want but I believe it is pure horse manure, although entertaining."
2,"Fun and enchanting, but escapist.","I loved this book the first time I read it, and when I first picked it up I had trouble putting it down. I was fourteen when I first read it, so I would recomend it to people in that age group. However, there isn't much deeper meaning to the book. If you're looking for a fun, easy, dramtic book, this is perfect."
1,Last Tango In Paris,"I though the film was terrible. Brando mumbled in French and the plot was unrealistic. I purchased the film to see how sexualism has changed over the years, since this was touted to be the first of expicit sexual scenes."
2,Struts in Action Provides better insight,Provides excellant insight about the sturts. Eagerly waiting for next edition that covers 1.2x and 1.3.
1,wow..................,"Can Adam get much worse? This is a naturally bad and stupid movie. Adam Sandler needs to give up, he is not funny anymore. All he does is play the same type of character in all of his movies. Don't buy this film, or anymore Adam Sandler movies to come."
2,A must read for those who love Indian romances.,"1877 - South Dakota to MissouriCassie Edwards' love for Indian romances is very apparent! I get the impression her heart and soul is poured into each romance she writes. THUNDER HEART like her others, is a revealing, honest, and romantic look at Indian history.Thunder Heart's band has been named Musti-Ponca (Warm Ponca) because the white man has moved his tribe to Missouri. On the trip his loss was tremendous, and now as they sit and wait on the white man, his chieftain father and his people are ill. Dede and her son Johnny first learn of the Ponca's existents when they hear the haunting songs of the tribe. Bill who lives with Dede in name only is out to seek revenge on the Indians for his painful loss. As he and others make destructive plans against Thunder Heart's tribe, Dede makes plans of her own.Ms. Edwards paints the canvas of her romance with some colorful characters, interesting historical facts, and a steamy romantic moment or two."
2,Good Simple Bike,"This bike was fairly easy to assemple ... Though I must mention that I did not get assembly instructions as others have noted as well. I did find it rater easy to assemble once thinking about it though .. I spent probably about 45 min in all, and other 20Min tuning the disk brakes and height adjustments.My GF says it is a great ride, really smooth, and brakes work great ... comfortable seat. Worth the sale price I got it at .. not worth full price ;-)"
2,Pampers are Perfect,I love Pampers Baby Dry. I've tried other brands but nothing compared. These are soft and hold up well for long periods of time (12 hours overnight). Highly reccomend!
2,An intense and powerful Drama!,"I purchased this movie because I am a huge Brendan Fraser fan, but the movie is so moving that I somewhat forgot that Brendan was in it and became so captivated in the story, that I ended up watching it again a second time. It is wonderfully acted! I think it's Brendan's best work ever and Ian Mckellen is outstanding in this movie. For anyone looking for a movie that will move you and having you wanting friends and family to see it, this one will. It's such a powerful drama. One that I will watch over and over. I'm glad to have it in my Collection."
1,Manufactured garbage re-packaged,"Sweat and Suit were two of the absolute worst albums of last year. Sadly, both of those disasters are being re-packaged and released again. Everything on here is just terrible. ""Grillz"" is also one of the worst songs I've ever heard all year. It figures that only Nelly would make a stupid song about his diamond teeth. It also figures he'd make a song with that horrible H-Town rapper Paul Wall. I blame Nelly for the state of hip hop today. He also created hip-pop which is one of the worst music genres ever created. Hell Cash Money and G-Unit make better club songs than this idiot. One of the year's absolute worst albums."
1,"Not even adaquate for older, round downtubes","These Sunlite/Pyramid BB stands have a notorious habit of shifting under the bicycle it is suspending, rendering the bike ever so slightly angled to one side or another - but just enough that a misguided poke will send the whole mess flying to the floor.I once exhibited a series of vintage and modern lightweight road bicycles at a show wherein these stands were provided by the event organizers. I had the foresight to bring chainstay/seatstay hook stands (even then, not the best - crank mount stands are my preference) for my personal bikes, which served their purpose as intended during the event. On the other hand, we nearly lost a Cinelli MASH to one of these BB-shell stands, and had a few close calls with the other bikes as well.I might use one of these in an emergency, but I would not rely on it. Neither would I expect the vinyl-coated hook to refrain from damaging a thin, 1970's-era paint job - or a current-era clearcoat, for that matter."
2,AWESOME MOVIE!!!!,I saw this movie 3 times. It's an incredible movie and is worthy of all the praise it can get. The acting and directing is top notch. Also the story is great. Can't wait to see Bale and Nolan again in a few years.
1,Impossible to keep sheets and mattress pads on.,"Everyone who slept on this mattress, ended up with a jumble of bedding after a few tosses and turns. I would not recommend it."
1,I will never buy another HP printer,Please do not waste your money. I have had one for 2 years and have reloaded the software to make it work at least 30 times.
1,"Interesting Ideas, Poor Presentation","While the ideas that lay the framework for this book are solid, everything else is lacking.The humor is forced, awkward, and on occasion plagarized. A nearly verbatim quote from a Monty Python sketch stands out in my mind.The plot is slow and seldom rivetting. The only thing that kept me turning the pages at some points was my search for the origin of the ""REMIND ME AGAIN HOW THE HORSE-SHAPED ONES MOVE"" quote.The character development is poor. The main character, Brutha, makes a sudden transition from a bumbling idiot to a sagely leader-of-men and bargainer-with-gods. I wasn't convinced.The ideas, however, are the salvation of this book. Read it if you have a good imagination...you'll need it to make up a new story around the concept Pratchett so poorly utilizes."
2,wireless works great!,This device works just as expected. It was very easy to set up (as long as you know your wireless information). It took less than 5 minutes to install and configure. The seller of this item was also very quick on getting this product to me!
2,Excellent boot,"This is the boot I've been buying for general purpose for 10 years. An excellent boot - wide enough for my wide feet - fit well right out of the box - leather is tough enough to last many years and out sole is very close to being a 'mountain' out sole. Good support, good shank, good cushion. this my boot of choice of work and light hiking."
2,An absolute must for jigs and safety,"Without a doubt one of the best books on Table Saw jigs. Many of the others I looked at had USELESS projects that went along with them....just filler. This book has NO FILLER, just great tips!! I constantly reference this book whenever doing a new type of cut, to see what time saving (and safer) way I could perform the task at hand. GET IT!!!"
1,Review of Introductory Circuits for Electrical and Computer,I'm sorry to say this but this book is absolutely horrible. This is my third year in college and this has to be the worst text book I've ever had. The text is not very informative and the examples are unclear. The book doesn't go into detail on most of the basic material. This is NOT a good book for an introductory level circuit analysis course.
2,Metal all the way.,This band has some very good music. The track 'Let Me Be Your Tank' has to be my favorite off the entire album.
1,Complete garbage.,"I had just bought this printer in May and it worked fine to begin with, now it's having the same paper jam and out of paper issues as almost all of the other people's printers are on this site..please, avoid this printer at all costs..all it does is give a person a headache trying to fix the problem. The only thing good about this machine is the printing quality, but that doesn't make up for the fact that it is a completely dysfunctional product. Had I read these reviews before purchasing, I would have never invested in this product..the sad thing is, I have previously owned a different HP model and it worked great..too bad this one wasn't the same."
2,Smallville season 9,"My Fiance are fans of Smallville. We have all the seasons now. We loved season 9, can't wait till the final season comes out to complete our collection."
2,Unforgettable,"Friend had me watch, ""Last Tango in Paris."" I couldn't find it in any video store so I immediately looked it up on Amazon.com and abracadra...it was found! Great price and was shipped quickly to my house. How convenient!!! Keep up the awesome work. I use Amazon for book club on a monthly basis and I am really pleased with everything. Wish I could get better shipping prices...For example, my last book was only a one penny, but the shipping was over 2 dollars. Wish you could ship more than one book, better price.Happy customer, Riley"
2,My favorite gift for my grandchildren,"Both my grandson and grandaughter have gotten many years of use out of this wonderful kitchen island. Very well made, sturdy and looks great, It actually stays in our kitchen so they can cook when we cook. I absoluately love this product. If you are lucky enough to find one it will be well worth the money. A family heirloom."
2,Lightweight and Warm,"The comforter is not lofty, but does ""fluff up"" nicely. It's lightweight, but don't let that fool you ... it will keep you warm. I gave it 4 stars only because the loft is low, but it really doesn't affect the warmth of the product. Great for a guest room. Buy it!"
1,Died after 18 months,"Everyone seems to have the same problem with this rice cooker. It just dies after 1-2 years. Ours is worthless now. Bought a simple one for $13, works just as well. DO NOT BUY!!"
2,Incredible Christmas gift,This book makes a great Christmas gift with a beautiful message and view of all those involved in the birth of our Savior.
1,Contains Transfats,The nutritional information on the packages I got do not match what is on the website here. Each bag has 4g of trans fats. Why the discrepancy? Why do they need to add that to sunflower kernels?
1,Boring Characters,"I really enjoy the science in science fiction, and believable characters. I have watched the movie Aliens many times and I have always wondered why you would pick really stupid people to go into space. Is there going to be a shortage of smart people in the future? Are we going to rely on a bunch of idiots to take us into the far reaches of space? Is mister Renolds watching too many soap operas on TV?"
2,Project Samuel,"I completely enjoyed this book. ""Dr Jack"" captured the current possibilities of cloning in his new book. It was hard to put it down, especially since I work in the biotechnology field. I especially love the ending (which I will not give away). You will just have to read it yourself."
2,Carbon Monoxide Alarm,I feel that these are a necessity especially if you live in colder winter climates where you may have the windows closed for a few months.I prefer this model as it plugs in to an outlet rather than battery operated units.I found the models through Amazaon were several dollars cheaper than stores around my area.
2,Essential,This is an essential collection of Jennifer Warnes early work (pre-Famous Blue Raincoat) for enthusiasts. It allows the listener to hear the evolution in Ms. Warnes abilities although the purity of her voice was there from the beginning.
1,Tackling Diabetes with Dr. Neal Barnard,Not all that great! The first section was informative while the rest was a wASTE OF TIME UNLESS YOUR A VEGITARIAN
1,Malfunction and battery doesn't last long,"Got this about 6 weeks ago. One week into it, the device started getting ""stuck"" on rewind. It's supposed to stop rewinding when you release pressure on the wheel, which it still sometimes does successfully. About half the time, though, it gets stuck on rewind and the only thing I can do is turn it off, none of the other functions (like play or stop) work.Newer problem: it's supposed to skip to the next track when you hit the fast forward button twice. It did that in the beginning, now it usually doesn't, same thing with trying to go to a previous track.Either I got a lemon or this device is poor quality. This is my first MP3 player so I have no basis for comparison regarding battery life but it seems the battery drains very quickly."
1,Review,"this brush is extremly hard, we cant use it and now the wood is getting black, keeping water insise.... is not good"
2,very good,Beautiful movie. I always admired Danish cinematography and this feature was the best so far. Fabulous set of very talented actors. I loved it and would definitely recommend it to everyone.
1,Please don't even bother with this one,I saw the original movie made in 1963 and it was wonderful. I was very anxious for this remake to come out and man was I disappointed!! It was horrible!
2,Don't miss it,We felt that this book has something to teach to everyone. It talks about two men that try to survive together. Of mice and men is a book that you can't miss beacuase it treats reality so well.
2,Great boot. Light but rugged.,This boot is well constructed for a light weight boot. I experienced minimum break in time with no hot spots. Good support and quite comfortable. I have not hiked in wet conditions so I cannot speak to the water proof feature. The boot runs true to size. I would buy another pair if these were damaged or lost.
1,No good,Buy a roll of scotch tape. Cheaper and same effect. Was a total waste of money. I was so disappointed.
2,Good Book,"I love the book by George C. Kenny who in my opinion apart from Claire Chennault was one of the greatest air generals of World War II.The only reason why I gave it four stars was because there were a few things that General Kenny did not talk about a few things about Bong. I read the book Jungle Ace about Gerald Johnson and discover that Bong had lost three wingmen in three months and Bong swore that he would never fly with a wingman again. In the book, 49th Fighter Group by William Hess, I found out that Bong's aircraft was hit a few times in a number of engagements by the Japanese."
1,Put holes in our pool liner,"We loved this toy at first . . .great fun! But when my son decided to put his foot in it and bounce around the pool, he put 7 holes in our pool liner before we discovered the problem. Never thought that would happen and this fun toy promptly went in the trash!"
1,Awful,"Wow, how bad does it get.It was a chore to read this book. It contains the most unlikely and implausible plot. The characters seemed to be conjured up and very unreal. Not interesting, not funny, not entertaining and it was really hard work to get through it.I droppped my copy in the trash bin when I finished reading it. There is no way I could ever read it again and I wouldn't want to inflict it on anyone else.I've never felt this way about any other book. It was awful."
2,"FUN, DANCEABLE LATE 80'S R&B INFLUENCED POP",featuring the following tracks:1. CALLOWAY--I Wanna Be Rich (4:50)2. PAULA ABDUL--(It's Just) The Way That You Love Me (5:21)3. BABYFACE--It's No Crime (4:02)4. LISA STANSFIELD--This Is The Right Time (4:30)5. TAYLOR DAYNE--Love Will Lead You Back (4:37)6. SYBIL--Don't Make Me Over (3:59)7. JOHNNY KEMP--Birthday Suit (4:28)8. MARTIKA--More Than You Know (4:06)9. SURFACE--Shower Me With Your Love (4:54)10. TYLER COLLINS--Girls Nite Out [Seoul IV Seoul Bite] (6:02)AN ABOVE-AVERAGE COLLECTION WITH SOME ALBUM CUTS OR LONGER VERSIONS!
1,Something to read while waiting for a plane or train,"Fairly decent ""junk"" reading, full of cliches (e.g. news reporter uncovering sinister conspiracies; romance between reporter and predictably beautiful, spunky, and mysterious female correspondent), and simplistic characterizations (e.g. the Globe's military censor is downright demonic, with no redeeming attributes at all). Best part of the book is its description of the hypothetical Cuban War, and its immediate aftermath as America gradually withdraws from the world scene (some sections are absolutely chilling). Unfortunately, the plot steadily unravels as it plods its way to the disappointingly predictable conclusion (which any half-intelligent reader will figure out by the first 1/3 of the book). Furthermore, too much of the story is derivative of Harris' Fatherland. But JFK adorers, former hippies clinging to the 1960s, and anyone who loses sleep over the possibility that the Redcoats will one day reconquer America will surely love the novel."
2,Savage and brutal,"This is a great, great cd. As the first Mayhem release with the current lineup, they came right out of the box with a masterpiece of unanticipated power. Each track is just monstrous in every way; and the production is some of the very best you'll likely ever hear on a black metal release. Note that this contains the first part of their epic full- length release ""Grand Declaration Of War"", so be sure to buy both. You won't be disappointed if raw, seriously dangerous metal is what you're looking for."
1,Item not as shown.,"The item's photo is for the new Estes parachute designed to look like chutes from the 60's. The chute was solid red, not the classic checkerboard design. Returned for refund."
1,Do not read!,Wow I have only read part of this book and it is now an all time low for me! I really do not like William Faulkner and unless you have to read this book DON'T!!!!
1,What was this story about?,"Yes there were some good effects and wild looking creatures, some decent ideas, a handful of good acting, but where the hell was the story? How many times can you kill yourself and go to hell to see the same thing over and over. It was less irritating when the same thing was done in little nicky. Reeve's acting is normally garbage but he gets put in some good movies like the replacements. This time it was his bad acting paired with an awful movie. You need a good ending."
2,cute toy,Our son will be getting this for X-mas. He loves crocodiles so we are looking forward to playing it with him.
2,WOOW!....Best book I ever read...,"I will never foget this book, mainly because it was the first romance novel I ever read. JULIE GARWOOD IS AN AMAZING WRITER. This book was full of intrigue, heartwarming romance, suspense, adventure, and danger from the beginning to the end. Gillian is sweet, strong and very brave. Broddick is Macho, sexy, sexy sexy!!! did I say sexy! ^^ courageous, and sweet (when he is around Gillian). They make a PERFECT! couple. THE OTHER TWO CHARACTERS: Brigid and Ramsey ( he too, is gorgeous-sexy-sweet and, falls in love with Brigid). THIS BOOK WAS SO AMAZING, I WAS DISSAPPOINTED WHEN IT ENDED!! If you are looking for a romance novel, THIS IS THE BOOK TO READ! WARINING: Do not read this book at night, because you will not be able to sleep. :) :) :) ^^"
2,A GREAT BOOK EVERYONE SHOULD READ,"The book begins with Lennie and George: Lennie being an oversized mamoth of a man--Goliath--in a way, and George being your man of an average size. The roll between the two is that they both have the same dream and that is to live off the fat of the land and raise rabbits. Lennie, is best put as retarded, but is really the nicest guy in the world: it is just his size that interfears with the two men's lives. George has a short fussed temper and Lennie can't help but be dumb when it comes to any situation they may find themsleves in. The book has a great plot that you have to stop and think about long after you have put the book down, and this is without a doubt, the most realistic novel I have ever read. I would suggest reading this at a MATURE high school level. If you are too young for this book, you will not understand it. If you do understand it, you will see what a great novel it really is."
1,Worked like a charm! FOR 5 MINUTES,"Really wanted this to work, but sadly disappointed. Literally worked for about 5 minutes and then stopped heating altogether. How difficult can it be to make such a device that actually works?"
2,Excellent Documentary of one of the Greatest Albums in History,"This is one of those movies that I didn't want to end. It is that good. Seeing Robbie, Levon, Rick, and Garth look back at this album, and talk in depth about the making of it, was pure heaven. Seeing the joy on Levon's face when talking about Garth's playing put a smile on my face. I'm not waxing poetic here, folks. If you love the Band, do yourself a favor and get this DVD."
2,"Good Movie, worth watching","This movie was good, because it show's that Van Damme doesn't have to kick the crap out of people to star in a movie. It has a good story to it and some emotional scenes that show Van Damme's true acting abilities. Definitly worth renting."
1,a Mac user,NOT at all friendly for a Mac user. The instructions are not at all helpful and tech services are not available on weekends.
1,A sin to humanity,"No, I'm not talking about Hester's crime. I'm talking about this STUPID BOOK! If only Hawthorne had kept his job in the customs house (see prologue), this abomination would never have been spawned from the cess-ridden depths of Hawthorne's twisted thinking organ. (You can figure THAT out on your own). This book is untolerably boring (the only proven cure of insomnia - if you don't mind the side effects) and the descriptions are ridiculously entangling. In the words of Mr. Hawthorne himself, this book is ""ignominiously"" dull. PRESERVE YOUR SANITY! NEVER READ THIS! NEVER!I sleep now..."
1,yoga for surfers,don't waste your money .lots of wasted time talking about how great yoga is.content is good but alot of fast fowarding.not useful as a work out video.
2,Be the man God designed for you to be,"Bill Perkins does it again! This is a very practical book about being a man at war with our culture. His six battles are Fight for your identity, Fight for personal holiness, Fight for your family, Fight through pain, Fight for your friends and Fight for a strong faith. Bill's personal examples and insights will help you fight these battles. Become a mighty man today!<a href=""http://www.millionmightymen.com/"">http://www.millionmightymen.com</a>"
1,Not a good vibrator,I bought this item 6 months ago and was immediately disappointed. Metallic beads are a almost painful on higher rotation speed. And the the metallic rod connecting the top with the bottom broke after 6 months.Do not recommend this item.
2,Janes All the worlds aircraft 1996-7,Great to deal with. Very quick delivery. Very highly recommended. Thank you.
2,baby dry diapers,"Baby dry diapers are not quite as soft as the swaddlers, but they haven't leaked at all and I definitely like them better than any Huggies diaper."
1,Dreadful book,"If you are a Christian, don't spoil your money with this book. I tried to search the credentials of the so called ""reverend"" but only in the book I could find his true identification. The book tells the same known stories of the apocripha and is full of lies and misconceptions. I don't recommend it and I already deleted it from the memory of my computer. Since I bought the eletronic edition nobody else will grab the remains."
2,Great Book,I love this book even though the ending confused the heck out of me. C.s. Lewis did a great job of retelling this myth i had not heard of this myth befor until i got to the end of the book where the author tells you about the real tale and how he changed it he did a great deal the tale and he changed it for the good wich made the whole character change and gave her a different out look throughout the whole story in the real myth the main feelings of the character was jealousy twards her sister psyche and in the myth retold the feelings of jealousy arent twards her sister Psyche she feels anger twards her sister at times and she feels that her sister does not lover her anymore because she wont come home to her. This tale has many twists turns ups and downs like a roller coaster and if you miss something you might not get certain parts of the book. I still think I need to read it again. I hope this might of helped and I hope that you enjoy the book.
2,Effectiveness depends on the cup,"This pad does get pretty hot, but how well it keeps your beverage hot really depends on the cup that you use. The problem is that most (all?) mugs have a circular bottom, so the actual surface area that contacts the pad is pretty small. That being said, my drink never really got colder than a step hotter than lukewarm, so I guess it works fine!Safety is somewhat of a concern, though. It uses a simple on/off switch, and I'm not sure what will happen if it is left on for days at a time. I think a system where it is only on when a cup is on it would be awesome.Your cup also sits about an inch higher off the table, so risk of knocking it over is a bit higher.Overall, a good and cheap solution to the everyday first world problem of keeping a hot drink hot."
2,one of my fave movies,thank you for shipping me the dvd as soon as possible.. it was really good although there was some scratches from the dvd but i dont mind it coz it is working perfectly fine... thank you
2,Great CD,This is a very good cd if you are new to Anime Cd's that are not english. All of the songs on it are great. I am not new to this form of music anymore so if you are new to this form of music and are a Sailor Moon fan like me. This would be a very good buy. ;}
2,LOVE IT,Smallville needs to come back even if it is superman the early years. Tom Welling will always be my favorite Superman.
2,Worthy addition to the bookshelf,"Stumbled across this recently and found it an agreeable and on-target accound of life in Japan, based on my own experience. Some parts soar, others drag, but one could say that about almost any biographical work that rings true. I've found one other memoir that more thoroughly nails shut the whole (surprisingly huge) ""teaching in Japan from the male perspective"" genre, but Feiler's book fills in a lot of blanks for those who wonder what it's like to live and teach in Japan, and does it in an engaging manner."
1,Do not read this book!,"I am sorry to all of you who like this book but I would never wish a single soul to read this. This book has the plot: a girl goes to a farm, falls in love and everything goes wrong. The book just goes on and on. The only reason I read it was because my mother asked me to. This book could have been written in 50 pages but no. It goes on for 300 some odd pages. I would have rather read the dictionary. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because there was maybe four parts that consisted of 2 pages that were mildly interesting. Take my word for it. This book should be skipped."
1,DO NOT BUY!,1) Too many options to make it run smoothly.2) Not a plug & play3) Breaks connection haphazardly
1,Unexpected,"I had to read this book for a college class, and it was not what I expected. I liked ""Defender of the Jews"" but not the main novella, ""Goodbye Columbus."""
2,Economics,"Very clearly written with a minimum of jargon. Basic principles easy to understand even for the non-economist, but topics were not oversimplified. Essential reading for anyone who wants to make informed decisions in these troubled economic times."
1,I was rooting for the whale in this one,"Having seen both versions, the first with Peck as Ahab, I would have to lean towards the original. The new version with Patrick Stewart had it's moments, but Peck as Father Maple looked like he was in a daze and didn't know where he was (or who he was) Peck's performance was rather disturbing. The actor who played Quee-Queg in this newer version was more like a cartoon. The actor in the 1950's version was far more convincing.Patrick Stewart wasn't a bad choice for Ahab, but to me it was more like Stewart PLAYING AHAB v.s. BEING THE CHARACTER. I kept expecting him to shout ""ENGAGE"" rather than ""THERE SHE BLOWS"".For students of the book, the original 1950 version was closer to the text. This new version had far too many added bits for the purist. If you enjoy remakes, (I don't know why) then go for it. If you are a stickler for detail, pass it"
2,A 'must-read' for any cyclist!,"I found the chapters on riding in traffic to be invaluable. I commute to work every day, and ride recreationally on weekends. The lessons in these chapters will save you literally thousands of miles of trial and error, and could save your life. It is a 'must read' for anyone who wants to expand beyond being a casual cyclist, and wants to use their bicycle as an effective means of personal transportation"
1,Returned it,This book is not like he rest of Dale Carnegie's books. The rest of hem are interesting and easy reeds. This'd one is bad
2,The Winter solstice,Having read this book previously by borrowing it from the library i decided to buy the book. The only place i could find it was at Amozon. com. I was very impressed at the array of books and the speed of Delivery.The book its self is a wonderful representation of the time of Christmas and I would recommend it to anybody for its factual representation of that time.
1,Skip it - buy the full sized version,This one makes too small and too fine a grind of pepper to be useful in cooking. You'll be cranking away on this thing for ten minutes before you get enough crushed pepper to flavor anything.
1,Bad horror movie,"The effects are pretty well done on computer but they do not succeed in making The Haunting much scarier.Catherine Zeta-Jones is not only acting poorly, she is also a complete misfit in this movie. It's as if she has just been asked to be in The Haunting because the makers want some chick on the screen. But you don't even see any of her sexiness in this movie.Furthermore, there are several ridiculous movie mistakes in The Haunting.There are a few relatively scary scenes and even some good laughs here and there. Apart from that, only Lily Taylor's acting is worth mentioning."
1,Used it once before it broke,I bought this for my 9 year old to sleep on. We used it the first time and everything was fine. Pulled it out a month later and it has a slow leak somewhere that I can't find to repair. Basically a waste of $35. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Further proof that stupidity comes in all colors.,"Firstly, I find it startling that Vintage would deign to publish something so poorly written. The semi-literacy of this prose (I'm being generous) does, if nothing else, suggest that Miss Souljah didn't use a ghost writer. The words, in all their ghettofied glory, are hers. Booker T. Washington would have wept. While I can appreciate to some extent this woman's pathological disgust of whites, I cannot understand the roots of her homophobia or anti-Semitism. Her easy-way-out philosophy (Everybody's to Blame Except Me) is the very thing that keeps her where she is."
2,Kylie takes a bite at subtlety....,"Kylie Minogue isn't a very subtle performer - she's famous for hi-NRG floorfillers, not purring ballads. A ballad in the hands of a pop singer can be a nightmare but with Kylie, it's a dream and CHOCOLATE is a perfect example of it. Sweet and slow, it flows like its namesake throughout, with a catchy chorus that will for sure melt her fans down. Remixed for release, this CD also includes the funky CITY GAMES, two remixes (the EMO mix is the better one) and a live track, taken from her BODY LANGUAGE LIVE DVD, which should receive a late 2004 release in the USA."
1,Little practical advice,"When you are thinking about starting your own business, probably the last thing you need is this sort of fluffy advice to become ""mature"", wear a suit, and heavily network. I was hoping for more solid information, like the virtues of incorporating rather than being a sole proprietor and other real concerns of a small business person. Plus the author's ""voice"" really irritated me. There are *much* better books out there on this subject."
1,"Problems installing software, weak tech support.","When I run the software installation, it loads it's two executable files into my startup directory. This shouldn't happen.When I try to launch the emarker software, it says ""Cannot initialize encryption, Application shutting down"".I e-mailed their tech support for some ideas and the responder said they didn't think the software would work with Win98SE. ?????"
2,Wicked SWEET,"This game is the coolest thing ever, you can practiclly think of anything and it will get it right."
2,Great deal!,If your'e reading this then you already know you like these three CD's. You'll like it better knowing you're getting such a great deal from Amazon. Three CD's for the price of one. Need I say more?
1,Terribly elusive.,"""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"" is poorly advertised. If you're expecting a novel filled with accounts of the Salem Witch Trials, like I thought, you're wrong. It is not until almost 200 pages into the book will the subject be touched upon, and then gingerly dropped. Much of the writing is fillers and dribble; this book could have been 100 pages shorter. I didn't care for any of the characters, and all of them were typecast. The angry, strict Uncle, the caring, soft-spoken Aunt, two cousins - one being the flirt and one being sweet. And, of course, the outcast niece. I was very disappointed, as I had my sights set on a captivating Salem Witch Trial book. The title is very misleading. I do not recommend."
1,This book is a waste of paper and ink.,This book is a waste of paper. It speaks in terms of generalities that are meaningless. The paragraphs are double spaced and the book is specific to the state of New York. I wouldn't wipe my you know what with the pages from the book. SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!
1,Fahrenheit 451,"We thought this book was a good one, but it started out to be slow and confusing. It is about a person name Guy Montag and he is a firefighter that burns books. He is starting to find out that it is not a good job, and he wants to quiet. This is all i can say because if I tell you any more it will give the book away. I can tell you that this is a science-fiction book, and it involves a different society. This is what makes the book so great.In conclusion, this is a good book, and even though it is hard to read in the begining, it gets much better.\Thanks for reading this."
2,It is HDTV guys,"The guy who said this isn't HDTV is very, VERY wrong. This is an HDTV, but it doesn't have the tuner built inside of it. It supports HDTV, but you need a tuner in order to get it. This is an excellent piece of equipment for playing the xbox 360 on, although it definately has backlight leaking on the top and bottom. As said before, VERY bright screen and I also run it at 50%. Besides the backlight leak, it is an excellent HDTV/monitor and plays games well with NO ghosting. BUY IT!!"
1,boring,This movie was really boring. It was slow and uninteresting. the man who did this movie is the one trying to bring back the Zatoichi series. I have not seen the new Zatoichi movie yet but this movie gives me great doubts about how good it will be. His other movies may be good but this one is a definite time waster. Save yourselves.
1,"Great graphics, no story line, no point.","great if you like doing stupid tasks in a tony hawk style manner. only problem is the time clock is always ticking making this an arcade adventure rather than a video game. Don't waste the money, good graphics or not, this game is not entertaining."
2,"Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck","The story took place in Soledad, California during the Great Depression. There were two migrant workers mentioned in this book, George and Lennie. They were best friends. Their relationship symbolizes strong vs. weak. One of them always causes the other trouble. You will think the weak one always causes strong trouble right? But the truth is, the strong guy(Lennie) always causes the weak(George) trouble. Why was that? First Lennie cause tiny problems, then bigger and finally the biggest trouble. Now what and how should the weak one(George) help or save his best friend?I give the rate of 4 stars to this book. It's a great book for love, friendship and at a loss as what to do. The theme of this book is sometimes friends have to force themselves do something that he/she doesn't want to. I recommend this book to those young children and adults who have been lost as to what to do."
2,"It was a good book. It is a good healing book, journal.",This book was very good to help with the healing process. I used it for a journal and it's a great reference book! I would recommend this to anyone who has lost a child.
1,All rest no work,"This is the worst DVD - total waste of money! I agree the only way you would give a 5 is if you were here friend and felt obligated. I have never written a review but couldn't stand it this time. There is very little workout time and mostly rest periods with a blank screen while mortuary music is playing in the background. I think she definitely knows what she is doing, just a shame she made it so boring. F"
1,Way too much Catholicism,I liked The Amber Room and LOVED The Romanov Prophecy. I was prepared for another terrific book. What a disappointment. This book is far more a fictional in-depth look at the selection of a Pope than a mystery thriller. I found it too far-fetched to be remotely believable.The flyleaf says Steve Berry is at work on his next book. Let's hope it's better than this one.
2,Fun Read!,"This book was a fun, quick read if you like question & answer advice. At times funny and kept me reading!"
1,Warning... leaks ahead!,"These leak every single day! Please avoid and save yourself money, time, misery and agony.We committed the mistake of buying a big pack."
2,I never get tired of it!,"Not many cd's can grab your attention and keep it for very long. Version 2.0, however, is one of the elite few who will have you praying for Garbage's next cd! So every one, go out there and buy this cd cause it has to be the best I have ever heard!"
2,THIS CD IS EXCELLENT!,"I gave this CD five stars because of Clays incredible voice. I will concede the fact that the production and the song choices could have been better. Nevertheless, Clays voice is so AMAZING that any shortfalls in the production and material is easily offset with Clays musical prowess. There are however, some excellent songs on this CD, such as The Way, Perfect Day, Measure of a Man and Shine.DONT LISTEN TO THE CLAY HATERS THAT COME HERE ON AMAZON AND GIVE THIS CD ONLY ONE STAR! Those people are just haters of good music and they are trying to persuade you not to buy this CD. Also, granted some of the five star reviews may be from ""Claymates"" but that does not negate the fact that this CD is really good.BUY THIS CD! It is entertaining and fun. Isn't that why we all buy CD's, to be entertained?"
2,A must read for public speaking,Excellent book. This book has been in print for so many years and has tremendous credibility. Reads like a textbook. A person in business who communicates must read this book. I highly recommend.
1,not for me,"A pretty light read, fluffy really. So I went to see what other reviewers thought, and redheaded fan is (according to the Wish List attached to their review) also named Gary Taubes. Not the same Gary Taubes who gets thanked personally in the acknowledgments to this very book?! Wow, that would be TOTALLY inappropriate, to go to some site (or anywhere I'd say) and give a ravey review to an old friend who thanks you in that book. If Redheaded Fan is some other person who just happens also to be named Gary Taubes, then nice for you you found something you liked reading. I didn't."
2,Beautiful folk songs,"This is a truly amazing album. 24 songs sung in a variety of languages including Spanish, Hebrew, Yiddish, Russian, Portuguese and Italian.Malka Marom, the daughter of a cantor, came to Canada from Israel, and Joso Spralja the son of a fisherman, from the Dalmatian coast. Although they had seven languages between them, the only language they had in common at that time was music, since Joso didn't know English. These songs were all recorded in the mid 60's before they dissolved their musical partnership in 1967.This album is full of beautiful folk songs from the world over. It is also an album that has to be heard and deserves to be heard. Their voices are beautiful as are the songs. Please buy this album, you will not be disappointed. The 12 page booklet contains an interesting essay about Malka and Joso as well as photos."
2,An 80's classic!,I don't know what it is about this movie but it's a classic 80's flick! Mark Harmon is at his best. The plot is a little predictable but it's entertaining and takes you back to the decade past.
2,Oh!,"This cereal is so sweet....yet so good for you! One taste=ADDICTION!!!! I just tried this cereal out of curiousity and I was hooked! It is an excellent breakfast choice, or just any time to eat! Especially as breakfast because you will crave more honey taste and you won't be hungry later {probably because of how much you'd eat} and it is actually sweeter and better than Honey Bunches of Oats. Cap'n Crunch Berries is an option, but this splendid cereal is SO FILLED WITH A HONEY-FILLED TASTE! I have not tried much better tasting cereal than this! Oh!"
1,Every paint was dried up,I purchased this a month ago for my daughter for Christmas. She just opened them to decorate the shoes this morning and every single paint except the light blue is completely dried up inside of the tube. She is disappointed and I am annoyed.
2,Saving the Past And returning to the Present,This book is about a boy who gets a toy castle as a gift and working with a knight going from the present into the past saving a old town from a evil ruler(Alastor).The town was saved and they wanted the knight and the boy to rule their town but the boy refuses and goes back to the present and the knight stays to protect the town from any other evil rulers.
1,"Bad, just bad.","Bad Acting, Bad Camera Work, Bad Editing, Bad story line. Sigh. Being a native New Orleanian, I had great hope for the movie. But it is just a waist of time to watch this."
2,Great substitute for University Physics,"I purchased this book as a substitute for the University Physics series book on Electromagnetism on a hunch that there might be older texts out there that are better and cheaper than their ever-updated glossy counterparts.I purchased this along with Purcell and the Feynman lectures on E&M.; I found myself referring to this book much more than Purcell and I looked at Feynman hardly at all. The other two were too mathematically advanced for me at the time as I was concurrently taking Calc II.The material tends to be covered first in some R dimension using a lot of symmetry to get the main point across and then the second half of a chapter will go into the details in R^3.Compared to its glossy alternative this book was more serious. Yet, the explanations are not beyond the first year undergraduate. It's cheaper to boot.I enjoyed this book very much and did very well in class relying almost entirely on this book and not opening the assigned text even once."
2,mayhem are the gods of black metal!,"yeah,...this isn't as great as ""mysteriis"",but who cares,...brutal as a really brutal thing,.. buy it,you won't be disanpointed,...hellhammer,maniac,blasphemer and necro putcher,...do i need to say more?"
2,Most Intense Bat-flick!,"I have seen all 4 Batman films prior to this one and this one BLOWS ALL OF THEM AWAY (even the still classic 1989 film starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson)!Christian Bale's version of Batman is very intimidating! I remember watching this film originally in the theater and being scared to death for the guys he interrogated! The villians (Scarecrow/Ra's Al Guhl) were smartly handled well. Rachel, played by Katie Holmes, isn't eye-candy like the previous leading Bat-women. She actually has spunk and guts.Overall, all the characters in this film are very believable. For those that still want an ""Adam West"" type Batman, please rent the old 1960's film or 1997's ""Batman & Robin"" by Joel Schumacher! Otherwise, I'd skip this one because that style of Bats doesn't live here! For everyone else, get ready for great ride! :D"
1,DOA,"This item arrived as advertised. We plugged the charger into our car and it did not work; no light, no charging. We thought it might be the port in the car. Tried others in the same car; it still did not work. We tried the charger in another car with the same results. We did not send the unit back due to the price we paid plus the shipping. I guess you do get what you pay for."
2,The One and Only... MS. JACKSON (If you are nasty),"This DVD is one of my all time favorite musical DVDs. Miss Jackson proves why she is the highest paid singer in the industry. With a combination of costume changes, great choreography, Janet's greatest hits, and a sold out crowd at Madison Square Garden, the DVD makes for an excellent night of entertainment. I only regret that I was not able to see the concert in person here in my home town due to a cancelation of the concert;however, the DVD is definately a suitable substitute. I highly recommend this DVD to any fans of Janet, lovers of music, and owners of quality DVDs."
1,I am being gererous giving this one star!!,"What you have here it the single most worst cd ever made.How someone thought it was a good idea to take Hank Sr.'s low-fi mono recordings, peel off his voice and put it in modern, digital stereo surrounding is beyond me.Imagine Hank Jr. singing a line, then a great guitar solo, then Hank III taking a vocal turn, then a guitar solo, then Hank Sr. coming in with vocals that seem to come off an lp that was found lying in the gravel somewhere at a flea market.It is beyond bad. Not a good idea, and nothing like ""There's a Tear in My Beer."""
1,Not good for showers,"Nice, item for the price, but not good for shower curtain use; not enough tension force. Best for light curtains in small windows."
2,Brain based Learning,"This is a text book I ordered for my classes for teacher certification. This book is very easy to read, and I am really enjoying it. It presents info and then at the end of a section, recaptures the essence of the reading for you. I would suggest it for any teaching class. I am learning so much from this book. I have been buying all my text books from Amazon because they are so much cheaper, and sometimes I can get free shipping. So far, there has not been a book that I could not find here at Amazon."
1,came without proper clamps,I purchased the item as a gift for my wife. It seemed really good and sturdy when I took it out of the box. When I assembled it(which was very easy) I found that there was no bracket for one connecting section. The item is very unstable and has fallen over and broken apart several times. I have no response from the supplier on getting a new clamp.
1,Billy Connolly suitable to under 5s,"Unlike all other Billy Connolly dvds; this one failed to offend Catholics, Muslims, women, gays, schoolteachers,foreigners and the 'Good English' Society. My wife,children and our local priest were not offended by this 'Big Yin'offering.This is suprising for a Clydeside comedian who has a 'no taboo' regime with his comedy.the reason that no offense was taken is simple.DVDs from USA do not work in the UK.Oh yes it took yonks to deliver and the girls at work got a bit spooked with the packaging from Frankfurt airport.Fingerpost in St Helens is still at war with the Hun.It does have a nice box though!"
2,exactly what I wanted!,this was the 3rd one i have bought and tried. Finally found what I wanted! this keeps my coffee hot! and it will even heat up cold coffee in about 15 min!! I would deffinately tell everyone to buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,must have got a dud,"got it through amazon.only keeps coffee luke warm.old sharper image can warmer cooler died after 4 years,services tomorrow,it blew this mr coffee plate away.can not find that type anywhere.would not recomend this item to anyone.."
1,Exploding diapers,"Our daughter is 6 months old and 19 lbs. She has been wearing these size 3 Pampers, and we wake up to exploded diapers many mornings, with little gel beads all over DD. I'm switching to Huggies overnight, based on a co-worker's recommendation."
1,What was this....trash is what it is!!,"I was not happy with this book. Luckily I checked it out at the library, so I did not spend the money on it. It was filth, trash, and poorly written at that. I wanted the erotic sensations like the vampires get when drinking blood. Instead I got nothing but sorry, flabby writing that went nowhere. If the book had belonged to me, I would have burned it!"
1,Only read this if you like getting depressed.,"This is a good example of the fact that pessimistic and shocking books often receive rave criticism while dynamically optimistic books are dubbed ""unrealistic""... NO further comment."
2,C-Murder Is For Real,"Tapped In Crime is a MASTERPIECE cd. C-Murder has hits on this on every street. The good songs are Forever Tru, Concrete Jungle, They dont really Know you, Want Beef, Ride, On da block, What you bout, Down 4 my N's, That Calliope, and alot More. Down 4 My N's is the best song on this joint this song feat. Snoop and Mr. Magic. C-Murder is off the hook! C-Murder is a rap Superstar!! Cash Money is Phoney No Limit is for real now thats Forever Tru Ya Heard me. No Limit/Tru Records is on fire and you dont want to Beef with this Army. They have to Much Paper and ther the #1 Rap Lable! No Limit 4eva ya Heard me!! Master P,Silk, C-Murder is the realest Rappers out there ya Heard me!!"
2,"if you don't like this you are an idiot,,, enough said",This is an amazing record. I need not say anymore. Thank the good lord above for making this records happen.
1,Yet another disappointed customer,"Add me to the list of folks who received a vibrator-shaped paperweight instead of an actual vibrator. I tried two sets of batteries just to make sure, but it was dead. Also, as others have mentioned, the toxic plastic smell was over-powering, so I was a little bit glad it didn't work or I might have been tempted to try it and I may never have gotten that smell out of me. :o)Amazon, understandably, doesn't allow returns on vibrators, but the paperwork for a refund was done in under an hour and I should get it in a few days, so at least that part was easily done."
2,Clay's voice shines through,"Reading the reviews it seems that many are based on the like or dislike of Clay or the continuation of a Ruben/Clay competition. Get over it! Ruben won the AI contest, they are both talented singers and their styles are different. That said, my critique of the album is that the songs are a little weak, overly orchestrated in some cases and some hokey instrumentals in other cases. Clay's voice, however, shines through and overcomes the weak material and the little time that was taken to put the album together. If you are sentimental and romantic at heart, like ballads, like to sing along, love Clays voice ... or any of the above, you will like this album. It just makes you feel good. Despite its shortcomings, I couldn't give it less than 4 stars since I love it and listen to it at least once a day. My favorite is The Way co written by Enrique Iglesias and hopefully we'll see some more like this on the next album ... stronger songs to match the depth of Clay's voice."
2,Happy,"The Saris bike rack worked out great. I had borrowed a three bike Saris rack from a friend and decided to get one for myself. I only needed a rack to carry two bikes so thats what I ordered. When it arrived I was taken aback by the fact it wasn't quite like my friends although it looked exactly like it in the online picture. It only had one upper arm rather then two like my friends. Over wise it was identical. I almost sent it back but decided to try it out instead. Glad I did because my concerns about stability with just one upper arm was quickly dispelled. Great rack, rock solid."
1,The Scarlett Letter,Written in old English. It was very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said.
2,FANTASTIC BEYOND WORDS!!!,"I had great expectations of this CD. It has surpassed all expectations I could have ever imagined. I don't recall when I have ever heard a CD and absolutely LOVED EVERY SONG on it. I am a huge fan of Clay Aiken's and I knew he wouldn't let his fans down. If you don't buy another CD this year, make sure you don't miss out on this one. It is worth whatever you have to pay for it. FANTASTIC!!!!"
2,"Good box, hard to work in.","Pros: Sturdy, Sleek Finish.Cons: Difficult to work in, loud fans.This is a neat little addition to the living room. When the box arrived I was stunned at how big this box was, I guess in my mind I pictured it a bit smaller. It's about the size of a toaster oven. There is definitely a certain order in which the parts need to be assembled. I would suggest you pick up a modular power supply because cable management in this not so little guy is a royal pain.It keeps very cool inside thanks to a well done air flow design, but the stock fans are loud, very loud, and can be distracting, replace them for ones you can actually control."
2,Love Amazon Diaper Prices,"Amazon has the best prices on diapers. Join Amazon Moms and get 15% off, then join the subscribe and save for another 15% off and then lookout for 20% off coupons in parenting magazine. Where can you get 50% off of diapers? It's so easy to order and I get them the next day to my doorstep. How can you beat that?"
1,20-Questions Handheld Game - Big Disappointment,"This game, although somewhat fun, is very limited in its capacity. The only way that the game is able to guess the item about which you are thinking, is if you choose something (an object, etc.) that is very simple, and that you can describe with great accuracy. Otherwise, the game guesses your thoughts incorrectly most of the time. It is not very sophisticated, and is truly not worth the money. In other words, do not buy this product."
2,Happy with the product.,"I received my zen garden yesterday, I really like it. For the price it is great quality. Also mine did not fall apart out of the box as others were saying. I was impressed with the packaging. For under $14 this is a great value. It is sitting on my desk at my office now."
2,Wonderful Book,"This is a wonderful book. I am new to the Catholic faith and had many questions. This book answered them all. It is very informative without being too long. I could not put it down. Now that I have finished reading, if I need to answer a quick question, I can look it up in this book. There are many misconceptions about the Catholic faith and this book set them all straight. It is wonderful for someone who is a cradle Catholic, a new Catholic, or protestant who wants to learn the truth about Catholicism."
1,Mothman Fiction,The author claims the book is factual. My gut feeling is it's fictional. As fiction it is not well written. Just a bunch of short tales kind of mixed together.
2,An Exceptional Novel,"Betty Smit's book, A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN is wonderful! I read the book for the first time eight months ago. Since then, I have read this masterpeice two times, and each time, it gets better! I recomend this book to all people, young or old, or want to read a wonderful book."
1,A REVIEW OF TILL WE HAVE FACES A MYTH RETOLD,"Sadly , and with great disapointment. If i am honest i will have to say that this is the most boring and awful book i have ever read. Like the last commenter i had to put it down well before the end. the title should read ""a truely boring book""i am an avid reader. I love the classics. but this has nothing in common with the real myth and the book is distressing. i found myself wanting to slash my wrists because it was such an awful and boring hysterical book that never takes off. I kept reading because of the comments of other readers. However i could not carry on and had to put this book down. I dont think i have ever read such a boring and moronic text."
2,Subscription deal,"I love this new subscription deal- the prices are so much better than you can get at BabiesRUs or Costco and I rec'd the diapers very quickly- ordered Friday, delivered Monday. I will definitely switch from my RewardsRUs deal to this service from now on."
1,Stopped working after one week.,"This desktop warmer worked great for one week. It kept my coffee at a nice temperature. However, after one week of use, it quit working completely."
1,not good,"the shape of these is so weird. no eyebrow has that shape. it's ok at removing hair. it has to be long for it to come completely of, doesn't work well on the little hairs"
1,Infrared MASSAGER,Amazon responded immediately but forwarded to the supplier. Don't waste your money. It's a hand held wand that may or may not be infrared. Doesn't heat up to any degree that will be helpful. Still waiting to hear back from the supplier (two weeks now) to return this item. Know someone who has the EXACT same item and paid $10.... Enough said
1,Thin and disappointing,"After reading Tony Earley's exciting stories in Here We Are in Paradise, I expected a much stronger first novel. In fact, Jim the Boy barely counts as a first adult novel. The book seems to have been written for younger children (its simplistic piety would insult teenage readers.) It's sentimental to the extreme, giving us an idyllic depression South that never existed, comforting as it might feel to some readers. There's no coherent storyline, just a string of events with no tension. The writing is supposed to be luminous and understated but is just painfully plain, with nothing under the surface. It's the literary equivalent of the Emperor's new clothes. A great disappointment."
1,Yikes!,"I can't understand why anyone would spend 20 years writing thisThe book is incomprehensible. Read a regular book you can understand without having to read it aloudI love Joyce. Portrait, Dubliners, great stuff. Wonderful poetry. He starts to get a bit wonky in Ulysses, but even that is readable (if not altogether understandable - Giffords book is definitely a necessary provision)But why write a book such as the Wake? Didn't he say he thought people would be laughing while reading it?But writing a book noone can understand..He must've been out of his tiny little mind. Couldn't he have written another play, or more short stories about the Eire he loved/despised.It makes no sense to me! Why would anyone want to read what is, basically, a mess. How was this even published? Didn't someone tap him on the shoulder and say, ""Joyce, this makes no sense""Good grief! Joyce was actually a decent writer to this point!"
2,How Fun!,"What fun it is to read a novel by one of my favorite ""corporate"" writers! This is a definite departure from the more business-like stylings of ""Diversity Blues - How to Shake Them"". I found myself drawn into the story, not only by the character development - but also by the subject matter. Without giving away any details, I'd like to say it's thought provoking and entertaining! A great drizzly afternoon read and a brain-teaser to boot. A reminder that you may not be as ""enlightened"" as you think you are!!"
2,Great Quality Toy,"This is great, wife loves it. We've actually had 3 of them. Wore out the first 2 over the course of about a year each. This has never failed to please her.The only issue we have noticed with them, is the rubber seems to react with other rubber types and ""melt"". We have had it happen with all 3 of them. So if you keep your toys together (touching) like we do, you may want to keep this one in it's packaging so it doesn't get an impression of another toy melted into it.It does tend to get louder the more you use it or the older it gets. At first it was very quite, but now we have to keep a hold on the rabbit to stop the noise from being overly loud (Especially if the kids are home).Again, all the cons happen over time. We will probably keep on of these as long as we can continue to buy them. It's just really good at what it does even if it doesn't last forever."
1,A nice companion to McQuarrie's text,"I thought this was a terriable book by itself, but makes for a nice companion when reading through McQuarrie's book. McQuarrie skimps out on some of the explanations and instead leaves it to the reader to figure it out for themselves by solving his problems at the end of the chapter. One can usually find the answers (or at least some hints) within this book."
2,John Carter the movie.,This is the book that the 2012 movie John Carter was based on. Of course the books and the movies differ but it was a good book and very enjoyable. The language was early 19th century and quite pleasant for a change.
2,Best investment ever made,"For a residential use, this is a ladder system that can't be beat for the price -- quality is A-1... Light weight yet sturdy. Should have bought one years ago !!!!! So impressed, that I bought one for my son in Arizona as a ""house warming gift""."
1,Not satisfied,I was disappointed in this item the color was faded along all four corners and it did not seem well crafted. I bought this item as a gift but I did not give it away. Now I am stuck with it.
1,Action,"Lots of action, but totally unbelievable, just like watching wrestling. Amusing enough to watch but not to own."
1,Poor quality,"I gave this product as a ""special"" gift to my wife for Christmas, She just loved it for the first 2 times of use, except we had to make sure the kids were asleep because it is loud. Now it just spins away, but no vibrations. She will still use it on occasions, it can still get the job done, but for the money I payed it didn't last near long enough."
2,1984: The most brilliant political treatise ever written,"Brilliant, simply brilliant. I will resist the temptation to make my review the shortest one here by saying that I think that 1984, for all of its literary value must be regarded as one of the greatest literary works of all time. The way in which George Orwell composes his purposeful sentences makes us reminisce of the style of Daniel Defoe. Here is a book, similar to Brave New World and We which shows what we may be coming to. A definite read. I couldn't put it down for a moment."
2,Great Book,A fascinating look at a young man who is beginning to question his youthful ideals. Does he abandon his lower class family and everything he believes to marry into a wealthy family? It is beautifully written and very real.
2,Great overnight choice!,I had been using Huggies Overnites and this was a great deal (with an e-coupon) so I thought I'd give them a try. I like how thin they are while still being really absorbent. Great fit!
2,An amazing book!,"If you are looking for a very practical look at how to live a life rich in many more ways than money, although money comes to people living life with a 'definite purpose' as noted in the book."
1,Expensive Junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Our 8 year old son ACHED for this toy for his birthday and although we thought it to be expensive junk, we wanted to see him happy. The FIRST one we returned thinking it was broken but soon realized with the SECOND one that we just weren't shaking it hard or long enough. After a week of trying to figure this thing out, the screen has gone fuzzy and even a new battery could not revive it. Even our 8 year old is disgusted and frustrated with the quality of this toy. It is going back tomorrow - at our son's request. If your little boy wants this toy, please show him this review and suggest he pick something else. It's just an expensive disappointment. Please read the review by Diane. She says it so much better than we ever could."
2,Great Stuff!,"We use Permatex orange hand cleaner in our printing studio at the University of Nevada, Reno where I teach book arts. We do a lot of letterpress printing, which means that everyone gets printing ink on their hands. The Permatex is like magic, removing the ink and giving the students and I clean hands. Highly recommended."
1,Do I Hear Golden Turkey Calling?,"Bad film, which wastes the talent of Lugosi. Film is obviously low budget(where were you for this one Universal?), and some scenes are too dark. A better film is Killer Bats(a.k.a The Devil Bat)."
2,Great book. Informative and well written.,"Sometimes you need to ""tie the right knot"" at the right time, and this book helps a lot! Sometimes you need to tie two different size ropes together; this book has a knot for that. Sometimes you keen a knot that will slip; this book has a knot for that. Sometimes you need a knot that does not slip; this book has a knot for that too! And what if you need to hang up / organize your extension cords...? Use the Fireman's Coil knot! Great book. Lots of color photos taken at each step."
1,"Oh, puhleeeeaze!","I wouldn't have stuck with this improbably (even for fantasy) tale much beyond the parts where Ayla: 1) invents shampoo and 2)discovers fire, but I was in that proverbial ""desert island"" situation (it happens!). I guess you have to be into sci fi set in the stone age."
2,This is a great campfire book that really makes you think.,"""The Song of Hiawatha"" is the best book I have ever beenexposed to. Every time I hear the wonderful rhyme of HenryWadsworth Longfellow, I begin to think of what this land waslike before the Europeans conquered it. It is a wonderfultale of peace between nations and a great book to read tochildren."
2,Good product. Recommended.,"This works as well as the other reviewers suggested. Easy installation if you've opened up your cpu before and exchanged a pci card before. The antenna has good range, and I was connected in minutes to my wireless router. Thanks a lot."
2,Nice compression shirt...runs small...,like the other reviews state order size bigger...trust me I usually wear XL...I'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice. I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet. SO do order size up.
1,BAD: DONT READ!!!,I had to read this book for my school's reading list. It was by far the worst book that I have ever read. There was no plot at all. All of my friends also thought that it was bad. Even some of my friend's parents thought so too!! My final word is DONT READ IT!!
1,Just a few.,"These are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again. It's far from complete though.Missing such memorable tracks as ""sealed Door"", ""wings across time"" or ""At the Bottom of the Night"".It doesn't have a single battle theme accept the final boss.Hell this doesn't even have Lucca's theme and she's on the cover!Had I seen a track-list beforehand I wouldn't have bought this.I blame my self for not being more curious of the number of CD's.I'm sorry I paid $35 dollars American for this travesty, may Lavos have mercy on my soul.Save your selves(and your money) while you still can!"
1,"Terrible movie, Great scenery","From the onset, this movie was stilted and poorly developed. While Diane Lane is wonderful in some other films, she was(or her character was) irritating at best in this one. The plot is trite, Hollywood drivel. Some of the costuming and lightingwere well-done. I'd like my two hours back. This one is definitely going to be donated to the library where people canbe tortured by it for free -- but not me (again)!"
2,Engaging Period Piece,This Austen adaptation is a joy and a gem in spite of its low production values. Thickly British.
1,Little results - if any,"Wife didn't have any luck with this product. Much more luck with the fenugreek. She also claimed this tasted like ""goat ass."" She has a way with words. The do not drink before and after instructions are a pain. That and the taste of goat ass that you can't wash away makes this a lowsy product."
2,These are not bad,"I was a little bit of a diaper snob a couple months ago & had to use the premium diapers. We were using Huggies Little Movers which were Ok. I found that they were bulky, would hold a urine smell & were pricey. I then switched to Pampers Cruisers & those worked really well. I liked the feel of them & they were less bulky then the Huggies. I never had leaking problems with either ot them. My mother in law bought me a package of the Baby Dry size 4. I just thought these were Pampers cheap diapers & they wouldn't work as well but I was proved wrong! We've been using the size 4 for my 12 month old for a month now & have never had a leakage problem. They are not as soft as the Cruisers but they are not terrible either. They are also much cheaper & with the Amazon mom deal they are even cheaper! Our daycare lady changes my daughers diaper 6 times in 7 hours so not paying a lot for diapers makes it seem better. They are worth the try."
2,How a religion is Born!,"This was an excellent historical work on modern Pagan Witchcraft. It does tend to focus on Wicca, but it does also talk about Druids, and non-Gardnarian Traditions. If you know nothing about Wicca, I recomend you start with another book, or the very last chapter serves as an excelent summary of what Wiccans belive, and though it seams weird to suggest it, you might want to read the last chapter first. Although the author is a historian and not a Pagan or a Witch, he remains respectful in his historical endevor. This book is an excelent example of how a new religion is born, and perhapse the only such history of the birth of a new faith to exist!"
2,First time documentation of the Abalone Industry,"This book is a seminal piece of work documenting the California Abalone Industry. This is a must- read for marine enthusiasts and divers alike. The author obviously put considerable effort in collecting factual historical data, events and photographs to produce this one-of-a-kind book.With the declining population of Abalone in California, the book captures the many personalities of the diving and abalone industries and clearly explains the equipment and techniques used from early days to modern times.A great addition to any diving or maritime library, we continue to use the text as a reference in our teaching and training of Marine Diving Technology at Santa Barbara City College.-Don BarthelmessDirector, Marine Diving Technology Department Santa Barbara City College"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!!!,"Hello peoples. I recomend not to read this book. As other readers have stated... it was very boring and 500 pages saying "" my life ..."" so you can read this book if you dont already know that life can .... if you dont know that, you should definitly read this book!!! i repeat... this book is very boring... and i dont recomend it!!!!"
2,Amazing experience....,"All of Tina and Nick's CD's are incredibe but this one is especially relaxing and perfect for escaping the rushed and hurried world we live in today.This CD will take you on a journey that will leave feeling calm, content and refreshed. Highly recommended."
1,Don't waste your money,"I did not enjoy this video or find it informative. I thought the video was very boring and only watched half of it before I tossed it. Also, I bought this because I was having my first child and didn't know what to expect during labor but once you go into labor the nurses tell you everything to do so the video was a total waste. Also, the lady on the video is very annoying. I felt embarrassed for her."
1,Very disappointing,"I really hoped this would be fabulous, but it just isn't. All the songs sound the same. Same tempo, same back ground and back-up. RCA or whoever told Clay to sing all the same type of songs was way off base. When done live, one song only, then Clay does come through as we know him. Where is ""Unchained Melody""? One of the songs that got him to the top two on Idol should have been included."
1,A Great Story; A Bad Book,"After reading ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer and ""The Climb"" by Anatoli Boukreev with G. Weston DeWalt, both of which were excellent and engaging books, I turned to ""Facing the Extreme"" by Ruth Anne Kocuour. Like Krakauer and Boukreev, Kocuour found herself high on a dangerous mountain in a blizzard. Like them, she survived, while others met their death. Unlike Krakauer and Boukreev, she did not write a great book about her experiences. The biggest problems with this book are the constant flow of bad jokes and puns, the constant put-downs of several of her climbing companions, and her total lack of modesty. Krakauer opines in his book that who lived and who died was a matter of chance, and that he could have easily died. Kocuour repeatedly tells the reader that it was her skill and planning that made her a survivor. I found her and her book to be obnoxious and less than entertaining."
2,Mug warmer,I can't remember if I reviewed these or not. I bought two so I may have review one. If so I would like to add to that. At first I was a little disappointed in how the coffee wasn't kept as hot as I would like it. All in all I still like it because I drag out drinking a cup of coffee over a long period of time but dislike cold coffee. This improved this issue a lot. Later I happened to cover my mug with a cardboard coaster to keep dust out while I dusted (Yea my computer room doesn't get the care it should from me. About an hour later I remember it and took a drink and was surprised to find the coffee almost has hot as out of the pot. Needless to say I keep a Cardboard coaster handy. Plastic doesn't work well water drops form on it and get all over the desk. I highly recommend These to anyone who dislikes luke warm drinks.
2,Excellent!,This is a great addition to the Stargate universe. You see all the favorite characters and get an actual end to an on-going storyline. I enjoy it a lot.
1,NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL,"I purchased this pampers and I was giving it a try based on the reviews. After using the pampers for 3 weeks, my baby experienced Urinary Tract infection, and I don't know how it happened. I went to my family doctor and the doctor recommended changing the diaper to other brand.I did more research regarding Pampers Baby Dry and there is also lawsuit against pampers.In short, I would NOT use this brand again. It costs me headache and pain for my baby."
1,SLOW SHIPPING- WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO DRIVE TO GET THESE,"I PURCHASED THESE 5 DAYS AGO AND HAD FREE ""2-DAY SHIPPING"" AND HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT. WE HAVE TWO BABIES AT HOME THAT ARE BOTH IN DIAPERS SO I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD BE CONVENIENT AND I PURCHASED THESE BECAUSE WE DON'T LIVE CLOSE TO A CITY SO I WAS TRYING TO SAVE US A TRIP... WHAT A MISTAKE!!!! VERY DISATISFIED WITH AMAZON!!"
1,I'll tell you why he's bad!,"Clay Aiken... why is he so big? Answer: he was on American idol. Did he win? Answer: No! Then why is he bigger than Ruben? Answer: it's a miracle! Number one, you have to admit, he looks sort of like a clown. Two, even his feet are huge! They look like a joke. But, I realize that this has nothing to do with his singing. What do I think about his singing? Awful! Every song sounds the same, and if he and everyone else would only realize how NORMAL he really is, you'd know that nothing of his is worth buying. If you want some real music, go buy Michael Buble's debut album, there's a guy with REAL talent. Clay Aiken is just a screaching clown that somehow scored a record deal. I will give it one star only for the fact that there is an actual CD in a case, that someone had to make."
2,tivo working again,We upgraded our router and our old tivo which we don't want to upgrade because we have a lifetime subscription didn't work with it so we had to purchase this so now it is working great again. Thanks!
1,He has a Decent Voice but He ain't no RUBEN!,first of all Clay Aiken has a decent Voice but make no mistake about it Ruben clearly was the Man Vocally of the two.Clay has this Safe run of the mill Material which He shouldn't be doing so soon.but then again considering what Rod Stewart has been doing with His Last two Projects then I think Clay should have done that instead.Rod needs these Songs&Clay needs to do what Rod is doing.nothing on here has Knock Out written on it.very Bland&dry.Clay deserves better than this.
2,Great Guide to Written Such Great Aplication Easy!,"The book is so great for written such a great easy that I actually GOT INTO HARVARD because I did everything he says and I got in because of it. After all I was always a really good writer but I didn't think I had need to use an guide book after all, but I read it after all and look, it really did it work!!! My good written got even better and made me get into any really great school. So if you think you don't need help you are a good writer to, you might be actually surprized by you actually IMPROVE you're all ready good stile, but try it anyway and you will actually see just how many more easys you actually CAN write...do what he says and you to actually will get into the colege of you're DREAMS! Im so excited. Thank you mr Bauld."
1,"Defective product, bad service","I purchased this adapter to replace another PS-AC4 that worked for about 18 months before going belly up. This one lasted two weeks. I called MacAlly and quickly got an RMA number, then I overnighted the defective item to them. That was ten days ago, and I'm still waiting for the replacement to arrive."
2,Cheaper elsewhere,"This is a great movie and worth any price however, I was at a Best Buy store recently and paid $5.99 plus tax. (BTY: it was not on sale but instead the everyday low price.)"
2,Great Book!,Romeo and Juliet is a wonderful read. I loved reading every minute of it. The summaries and the explanatory notes help you understand everything about it. This is a great book and I would recommend you read this as an introduction to Shakespeare. I did and I am now going to start A Midsummer Night's Dream. Read this book! You'll love every minute of it!
1,Mario vs Streetfighter which is worse?,"I love videogames, I love movies, sadly Hollywood has yet to figure out how to put these two together. To put it blankly, this movie is bad, really bad. This movie rivals streetfighter! They both have poor plots, sad sad dialogue, and nothing to do with the games their based on. Koompas aren't reptiles, and Van Dam sure doesn't seem american to me.Heres a better idea, if you like videogames, check out mortal kombat or resident evil. If you like family movies, which I think SMB was suppose to be, check out instead any Pixar movie. Especially with toy story 1 & 2 special editions out now."
1,Not real history,"This guy does not check his facts with primary sources and has many axes to grind. He has admited in interviews that he is not really an historian, but is rather a writer with research assistants and relies mostly on secondary sources. Useful only to those who know not where else to go. Really has it in for the B-29 and Hap Arnold."
1,"Beware, this isn't a new book.",I was pretty disappointed when I purchased this book because I thought it was the next book in the series. Instead it is just a compilation of the previous 3 books one after another.
2,Great movie,I loved this movie as a child and was really psyched to find it on DVD at Amazon (and for such a great price!). I can't wait for my young son to watch this movie with me!
2,"A ""Have to See"" Series!","Best season out of all of them in my opinion. If you're not a fan of super hero comics, Smallville will definitely change your mind!"
2,The Music is great,"Not a weak note in Menotti's score. I try to see a local production every Christmas. The music is so superb, I cherish amateur performances. The tech is dated, but it is beautiful from start to finish."
2,Good Witchy Fun!,"This is one of my favorites in the Night World series by LJ Smith. I have a thing for witches, and all the information about actual spells, spell ingredients, circle casting, and witch history was simply fascinating. Thea is a great character, and her relationship with her soulmate Eric is endearing, but the real standout star in this book is Blaise.Blaise seems like your typical wicked witch, but despite her disdain for humans (that's how she was raised so you can't really blame her), she's supremely loyal to her family. What she does in the end for Thea almost made me cry.What I love about LJ Smith's books is that the main themes go much deeper than just supernatural characters; her books explore and highlight the importance of relationships, love and loyalty. Spellbinder is one book I know I'll be reading over and over again for the rest of my life."
1,look out for the explosion,squezing the tube watch out for the back of the tube blowing out and getting goo all on u
2,More readable than others would have you think,"Those who follow the AP Book of Rules for writing (i.e., subject, predicate, no commas, no decora) will have a tough time negotiating Faulkner's peregrinating sentences, but it's worth it. This book delivers several experiences at one time: a look at the Southern social codes, a textured appraisal of racial relations, an adolescent's step off into adult life, and an entertaining murder mystery. The lead characters are nicely drawn, with surprises; the action and crowd scenes are portrayed in easily visualized imagery. For all the Southern writing I've read, this added more information about the culture and people. I feel sorry for those who don't have the patience for Faulkner's style: a taste for it isn't that difficult to acquire and it's well worth it."
1,"A bad book, poorly written.","The plot is not believable, there is not a shred of character development, and there isn't even any descriptive atmosphere. It shocks me that Jack Higgins and the publishers actually make money off of this puerile drivel. I shall not buy any more of his efforts."
1,suckfest,"if you gave this movie more than 1 star you are high. no plot , bad acting, and too gruesome for theaters...NOT!!.the movie goes on for an hour before anything happens and then its' just downhill from there.not gorry just boring..."
2,A Great Beginning,"I loved this movie so much. Everything was perfect. It balanced the action and the drama perfectly and was a very mature film. It was realistic and not cartooney like the next four films in the series. The acting all round was excellent. Christian Bale was great as Batman. Also Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman and everyone were great. But I was most surprised with Katie Holmes. She really held her own standing among these great male actors. Overall BATMAN BEGINS is the best of the five Batman films.The Series:1- BATMAN BEGINS2- BATMAN3- BATMAN RETURNS4- BATMAN FOREVER5- BATMAN & ROBIN"
1,Major Skip Problem,"While the memorex CD player did impress me with it's ability to read through scratches in the CD, it had absolutely no anti-skip protection. Simply riding in a car sets it off at least once a minute. I would definitly recommend spending another $10 or $15 dollars to get a product with anti-skip protection!"
1,Worst video game adaption for a move.,Some video game movies are great. Others are horrid. Super Mario Brothers goes beyond horrid! It seems as though nothing was thought out when writing the script for this movie and it does not resemble the game by Nintendo in anyway. If they had slapped a different name on this and changed the names of some of the characters I think this movie could have received 1.5 stars rather than just 1. There is nothing of value in this movie and I strongly suggest that you stay far away unless your looking for something to put yourself to sleep if you have insomnia.
1,Fell short of expectations&#65533;,"I heard so much about this book before I finally picked it up. And when I did get around to reading it...I wasn't impressed. Yes, the author's ideas are scary: That in the future, firemen set fires to burn books. One firefighter, Guy Montag, begins to look at his life more closely and discovers how empty it is. He begins to take books home from many of the places he has destroyed. Clarisse, Guy's next door neighbor, and seemingly the one that set his book-stealing into motion, is one of the most interesting characters. Unfortunately, she disappears without much explanation. I did see some good messages in this vision of the future, but I felt a little bit cheated too, because I wanted to get a better glimpse at this society that spawned this fire fighter-book burners. I'm not debating if it should be a classic or not, I'm just saying it was not personally a very good book to me."
1,A book written by a torture lawyer,There's no way I would read a book and give profit to a man who wrote memos to attempt to allow Bush to circumvent the Geneva Convention against torture.
2,A music fan,"I am totally blown away by this album! I haven't heard anything this great in a very long time. Clay has the most beautiful voice in the world, I highly recommend this CD if you enjoy real music."
1,IT STINKS ON ICE.,"Wavery-voiced pop icon Madonna and incomprehensible non-singer Banderas absolutely destroy this wonderful score. The orchestrations are hideous. Pass this one by, and get the Broadway version (a masterpiece) with LuPone(BRILLIANT!) and Patinkin."
1,"If you believe people have an eternal soul, this book is not for you.","If you believe people have an eternal soul, this book is not for you. If you believe death is the end physically and spiritually, and you want your child to believe that, maybe you will like this book. I found it not comforting at all, and not what I want my child to believe."
2,Good???,"It looks good, but we never had carbon monoxide in our place yet, so we can't tell if it works or not. The red light is on when we plug it in. And it works when we press the test button."
2,This is the type of 'Garbage' you don't throw away!,"Hello = )if your looking for great music, then you need this CD , you won't be dissapointed by it. 'Milk'is my personal favorite, it makes me want to cry..tears of sympathy (and of joy) for this great song, i don't care who knows it..it's wonderful, and Shirley Manson has a great voice for all who appreciate great voices, she can really sing, and touch your soul. Have a nice day."
2,History Summer Reading-Fayetteville Academy,TAFFY OF TORPEDO JUNCTION is about a 13 year old girl who lives on the Outer Banks off the N.C. coast during World War II. This book was exciting and easy to read. I would recommend this book to a friend because it gives the reader a chance to see how rough it was to live during a war. Taffy uncovers a group of German spies living on Hatteras and reveals their location.
2,Worth Reading,"Hutton more or less aproached the book as an unbiased historian instead of going out of his way to critique Wicca. Although just stating the facts in itself makes wicca look silly. I'd recomend reading this book. As much as I dislike Wicca the history and evolution of it is interesting.Wiccas roots are in freemasonry, crowleyish occult b.s and well meaning but flawed writers like Yeats, Frazer and Graves. Once you get past where its roots lie it gets even worse. Wicca has absolutely nothing to do with true Heathenry. Its more or less a bunch of made up crap. I look at Wiccans as borderline retarded goofballs and roleplayers. I don't spend much time worrying or thinking about them, but I hate that most peoples perceptions of Celtic Heathenry comes from wiccan non sense and that they are making inroads into the Asatru community."
2,Exactly what I needed!,"When yet another VCR died on me, I decided it was time to move on up to digital. I have regular (analog) cable, no cable box. This unit is perfect. It easily replaces both of my VCR's and allows me to record two different programs at the same time. I can even watch something else that was previously recorded at the same time! Set up was very easy, the only downside for me was that my TV is not located near a phone jack, but that was pretty easily worked around. All in all, it has performed exactly as advertised and has made me wonder what took me so long!!"
2,A practical life-saving guide.,"The book gives practical advice for those with diabetes. I've had type 2 diabetes for 13 years and when another ailment required me to use prednisone, I needed insulin. Dr. Bernstein's book taught me about the types of insulin and syringes. His book removed my apprehension about needles and possible low blood glucose. Like many pioneers in medicine, Dr. Bernstein's ideas were opposite to mainstream methods when his book was first introduced. However, his recommendation for a limited carbohydrate diet like that of the late Dr. Atkins, appears to be gaining acceptance. Control of diabetes is very much up to the patient. Dr. Bernstein's book puts life-saving knowledge in the hands of the patient. I have found it invaluable."
2,"Never bought the first one, this isn't bad.","Considering how much bad music is out there these days, this was nice to come across. Covers a wide range of topics and moods, musicianship is pretty good. I'd recommend it to just about anyone. My tastes are usually heavier and more progressive - Rush, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Queensryche. But I like this disc too."
2,Take the good with the bad,"Ok, before I bought this DVD, I read all the reviews and I was prepared for it to be really annoying. IT WAS! She gets on your nerves. She LOVES to act, and she thinks she is really funny, but it gets old quick. On the other hand, I was so glad that I sat thru it because me and my husband learned so much. It was too late for us to get into a class, and this was really so informative, and it went over pretty much everything you need to know about going thru labor or having a c-section. So, for the people who said it wasnt enough cuz you didnt get to interact with couples or instructor, why did you buy it? Its great if you cant go to a class. What you learn is the most important part of this, isnt it?"
2,Best overall,My nephew and I are going to South Africa for the World Cup. I took all the South Africa travel books out of the library and thought this one was the most clearly presented.
2,Welcome to 1059 baseball!,This is a great book that will give you insight on what major league baseball was really like in the late 50's
2,It was a very real and powerful novel.,"This book was excellent. The charecters are very real. This book focuses on love and hate becuase Patty does something so incredible. She does something that will forever change her life. I would tell you but then I'd ruin the book. Ruth is also a great charecter becuase she really adds to the whole novel. This novel was sad yet I want to read it again and again. Patty (to me) is a true hero and at the end of the book I though to my self.....""you go girl."""
2,"Nice, sturdy and useful","This is a really great buy. I saw a similar one while out shopping but thought I could find it cheaper-Amazon was the same price, but I think the one on Amazon is much better quality than the one I was looking at, as this one is very heavy and sturdy-the other seemed quite flimsy. I'm terrible at assembling things, but this couldn't have been easier and had good, easy to follow directions. It's a nice height, very level and sturdy and will be useful for many years to come, possibly my whole life-we'll see."
2,Legend of Dragoon Soundtrack,"This soundtrack is amazing. It has all the songs you want to hear most though it doesn't have all the songs. I've played the Legend of Dragoon for a very long time. It's a great game and you really notice the music once you hear it on the soundtrack. Amazing game and music.I highly recommend it,Logan"
1,Intense chemical fumes,"The fragrance on this product is egregiously intense. In fact, I tried to air twenty of them out in a closed room and the air in that room over a matter of days would make you light headed and naseus. Don't buy them!"
2,1984,This is yet another book that is difficult to put down. There are a few sections that you have to trudge through but it is entirely worth it. This is a very thought provoking novel and is beautifully written.
2,Delivers what it promises.,"Mr. Erwin's book delivers what the title promises, ""Creative Projects."" From cool ideas for the kids like a giraffe or the ""Tickle me Lego"" toy, to fun things for adults like ""Machine with Minifig,"" there is something for everyone here.PROS: Plenty of project ideas for all levels of builders. Tips for building and programming. Ideas are open-ended to allow plenty of do-it-yourself experimentation. I especially liked the internet resources listed in the back.CONS:Projects are not laid out in step-by-step detail in the book. (They are on the CD-ROM)."
1,Movie sucks,This movie was crap. It boasts of a journey of submission and tale of D/s. It is boring and merely a poorly filmed interpretation of the lustful quest for dominantion.
2,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"I ordered this book as it was my book club selection, very sure I would not find it terribly interesting. What a surprise it turned out to be! This is a very readable, colorful story of an immigrant family in early 1900's Brooklyn. With every page, Betty Smith carried me away to these neighborhoods and ethnic communities. I loved the trip."
2,i really liked this album,"icp for the most part has disappointed me in the past with the releases of abk,amb and Esham. but i have to say this album is up there with the Jeckel Brothers era."
2,Great!(:,The book was a little slow being delivered but no problems! It also came in better condition than I was expecting! (:
2,Great Headset !,"Use it almost everyday! I have no complaints about the headset, it is very loud and the sound (both ends) is great! I bought it when amazon, had it for $19.99."
1,there was no entry for zero stars....,"Bad, bad, stupendously awful! Really bites the big one. That's probably what Leonard Pinth Garnell (sp?) would have said on the old Sat. Night Live show. What a big disappointment this film was. We are huge fans of the original, and went to see it with high hopes. It seems that most of the rest of the viewers felt the same way; people were restless, chatting and getting up to get more snacks. When Owen Wilson loses his head, instead of screams, the theater filled with sardonic laughter. Neeson phoned his performance in, Lili Taylor was wasted, and Zeta-Jones, well, as an actress, she is very pretty."
1,Kit to fix the problem is not that available easily,"I tried online 'live'support and asked for the kit to fix the ""out of paper"" problem, but they put me through a bunch of questions about it that took so long that I ran out of time. It does not seem to be as simple as contacting them and having them send out a kit."
1,Pat-a-cake shmat-a-cake!,"The 1 star is for the DVD not the film. Roger Rabbit is EXCELLENT, but the DVD is very poor. The menu is borning and rushed, the conversion from video to DVD is not amazing and you can see a lot of grains of dust on the film which cause the blobs you associate with old movies...The sound is excellent and colour too. No extras, no trailer, no good as a DVD. I would wait for Disney to make a 'Collector's Edition' which to you and I is what we expect of an normal DVD. 5/5 for the film, 1/5 for the DVD!"
2,Superb,I bought this because I am a huge Batman fan and love the movies directed by Christopher Nolan. This guy is a visionary. The limited Giftset edition is a plus. You get a set of added content that I don't think you will be able to get anywhere else. The movie in Blu Ray is just perfect 10/10. If you're a fan then get this
2,EXCELENT!!!,"It's just fantastic, an adventure full of emotions and wonderful landscapes. These series have given to humanity a great gift. Thanks a lot Ms. Auel. I hope you will continue the Ayla's story. I've been waiting for years to continue the story, I'm sure you have too much to write. When the next book will be coming out?. Every time I go to a bookstore I look for the next one."
2,I found it! Henry Dog!,"I had two Henry Dogs. One I lost in a ride at Walt Disney World, the second to replace it. I have no idea where Henry got to. But now that I found ""him"", I will have my friend again. I had this toy from the time I was six years old, almost 40 years ago, and I think I'll be seeing him again around Christmas time. It's a sweeet toy and really good for children of *all* ages!"
1,"Kind of lame, as most horror movies are","I'm not usually one for horror movies, but a friend of mine made me watch ""The Descent"" with her, and it wasn't as awful as I thought it would be. The first half of the movie is scarier than the rest, because it involves a group of six women exploring a dangerous underground cave. Being extremely claustrophobic, that alone was scary enough for me! However, then the women start being hunted by evil Gollum-like creatures who live deep within the cave, and the film takes a turn for the worse. If you're a fan of horror films, you'll probably enjoy ""The Descent"" because it's gruesome and relatively scary, unlike most of the ridiculous films that currently pepper this film genre. However, if you're like me and don't care much for these type of movies at all, definitely skip this one."
2,great,"love this diapers, they are so soft for babies and they fit very good and also the material is not hard for the babies' skin that for me is very important ."
1,Don't buy ! There's no ISP for it,I owned many models of Mail Station & loved them from the years 1999-2006 but since then there are no ISP servicers for this gadget. It used to be owned by Earthlink whom was then bought out by Cidco and now there isn't anyone providing service to send/receive emails with this thing which is too bad since it was easy & fun and a way to communicate without the internet without spam or any advertizing. Whenever mailstation has a new provider ( doubtful ) I will purchase another 1 year contract as my gadget still functions it's just that I cannot connect without an ISP. Everyone whom owns this thing knows what I speak of; it's obsolete so why buy one ? ( If you read the disclaimer below it states they won't supply service to new customers ; so what is the point in buying this ? )
2,Best Breastfeeding Supplement Out There!!!,"I have been using More Milk Plus for three months now and started using it when my son was a couple of weeks old. My first son fussed while nursing causing me to be frustrated with it and pumping upon returning to work was stressful. I nursed him until he was a year and couldn't wait to be done with it. My three month old doesn't have a problem at all nursing, every three hours my breasts are full and ready to nurse, I pump every morning to store additional milk (I'm now up to 200 oz. in the freezer) and I take More Milk Plus three times a day. I will not stop taking the supplement for fear of my supply decreasing. Anyone out there looking for something to help, this is your answer. The taste is pretty bad but mixed with 1-2 oz of OJ make it bearable. An 8 oz supply lasts me about a month and a half."
1,sloppy,"I get that they want a standard for fitness classes, but if you dance the techniques correctly it is a workout. But just to move quickly with poor form is crazy. The more precise the movements especially the figure 8 movements the more tone on gets. The hands are ""Sloppy"" and the arms are dead weight. Shoulders are not kept away from the ears correctly. I just think you are better off buying a technique dvd with a dancer of professional performance status and drill the sequences.I found the transitions, sequencing, foot patterns and overall energy ""Sloppy"""
2,Complex Love,I have seen all movie versions about Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and still love the book everytime I revisit the story. Every word captivates the reader into truly feeling the passion and tragedy of these two lovers. Even a character such as Tybalt Capulet won me over as far as description goes. Shakespearian writing is very much complex and confusing but it has a touch romance and anger which adds to the emotion of the story. Read this classic tragedy!
2,Ultra Force Field Jacket,"The real deal. Wore one when riding my motorcycle in Europe during the winter. Field jacket, liner, and undersweater. 28 degrees and still comfortable. Great investment."
1,"Love the Simpsons, but this ain't Christmas.","Don't get me wrong. These are great episodes to be sure, but why did they put them in a compilation of Christmas episodes. Two of them have virtually nothing to do with Christmas at all. Just because you set a scene in the winter time does not make it a Christmas episode! The other two mention Christmas only as the jumping off point of their story, but never return to Christmas at all as a topic. No tree, no presents, no Christmas like fiascos. Once again, wonderful episodes, but they don't belong here."
1,Item was nice color,"This rod was too flimsy in my stall shower to stay up more than 10 minutes with a curtain. We put it up at least four times and it fell down. I returned it. Color was nice, it was extremely thin."
1,The angel slipped,This is a light weight film with a heavy weight star. The film is not worthy of the great Paul Muni.
2,More than happy!,"This book arrived looking just as nice as a brand new one, even though it was listed as, ""Used."" Very pleased and would highly recommend this seller!"
2,Good,Works fine. Easy to install. Some reviews talk about not fitting wall plates. Designed for the plate supplied to fit over the existing plate so plate supplied is over sized for a reason.
2,Good Results,"I purchased this workbook for use with church groups during Lent. The narrative was instructive and the use of scripture and other sources was relevant. We especially liked the suggestions for using each lesson throughout the day. We had our last session today and the feedback was very positive. Although we met in groups of 4 to 6, the workbook would be good for an individual also. However, the group setting encouraged more commitment than a person alone might be able to muster"
2,Where to start with MOTORRRRRHEAD?,"I you are new fan who doesn't know which one of the countless Motoralbums to purchase first then look no further... ""Overkill"" was the first album to get the public's attention. It features concert regular classics such as ""Metropolis"", ""Stay Clean"" and the overkilling title-track.This edition of ""Overkill"" includes an interesting batch of bonus tracks such as the Kinks cover ""Louie Louie"" which was Motorhead's first hit single.All the tracks on this album are headbanging gems and now it is 50% extended. Get it, it's a good choice."
2,Inspiring. The book was a wake up call for me.,"It may sound corny to some but the people described in this book represented the values of the majority in their time. It's only because of them and hundreds of thousands like them in the U.S and other countries, that Americans enjoy the riches and freedoms that we take for granted today. The book could have been large enough to fill up a good size library. However, Tom Brokaw did an excellent job of choosing a good cross-section of the country. I was impressed with his own insights to that time and got the feeling that his words were from the heart. As the son of a waist gunner on B-17's and POW who never spoke of the War until his last few years, I whole heartedly agree with the title of this book."
1,Broke in less then a month,"I bought this tent on 6/6/2005 for my 10 month old boy and used it once at the pool the rest of the time it sat in my dining room. I went to bed one night and it was up, but the next morning it was halfway down. When I went to see what was wrong I saw that one of the rods had snapped off in the metal holder and cannot be fixed. This could actually suffocate a baby if noone was in the room or the baby could hurt themselves if they found the broken rod. I was very disappointed because the size is great. I also agree with the other reviews it is hard to put together because the rods are so tight you have to have alot of strenth to get it set up. Please don't buy this we are going to return but it's such a hassle to spend 39.99 plus tax on something and it breaks in less then a month."
1,I'M OVER IT,"With.. Mario Sunshine, Metroid Prime, Star Fox, Zelda, & Wario World who's going to have time for this? Please ~Acclaim~ no sequels. Truthfully the first level was so boring I didn't care to go further. I know it reeks that you may have payed ~x~ amount of $'s for this game , but don't beat yourself up. Just brush it off and buy one of the other games I mentioned above. I can only give a few nods for good graphics, sound and idea. Hence the 2 stars."
2,Off the Hook! Couldn't Get No Better Than This,"This CD is the bomb, it has something to do with sex but it works for me! My favorite songs out of it is: All I Really Want, I Wish and the remix, also the greatest sex along with I Decided. I believe this is R. Kelly's best album, all organised and all produced by him... I would like to give this album a million stars. I'm out, 1 love all."
2,great,that guy beforeme has a point only about 3 songs out of 12 are good in limp bizkit albums so thats why im buying this cus its got thier greatest i think it will sell well.
2,...,"Talk about non stop energy. System Of A Down's sophmore release, ""Toxicity"" has people talking, and talking loud. Hailed as ""one of the best albums, EVER"" by many critics, SOAD shuts down the skeptics and the critics who thought they could not top their debut album.Not only does it top the album, it blows it out of the water. Serj and he boys have really done their job here, and offer a unique brand of metal that stands out from most of the nu-metal/rapcore sludge out there.A must-have for all rock fans, ""Toxicity"" will have you pumped up for a long time."
1,Typical Imported Product,"The case is pretty much useless. Nothing stays in the small compartments. I really dont know why they exist. The small screwdriver, both flathead & phillips are cheap material. You cant magnetize it in order to hold the screws which would make all the difference considering the size of the screws."
1,A Great Disapontment,"I purchased this book with great expectations. It is richly illustrated with rare photographs of obsolete aircraft soldiering on in an important area of operations. The writing and research was excellent, which I have come to expect from Mr. Hagedorn. However, one of these rare photographs depicted a nude strip-club dancer. Others depicted aircraft with explicit 'nose art'. When I read a military history book, it is my expectation that I (or my son) will not be subjected to objectionable photos. I returned the book for a refund. Sorry Dan."
2,AHOOOOOOOOooooooooo!,"Kool family flick! Combine this with the Teenage Werewolf two and have a howling good time...hey, it's a werewolf, it's funny, how can you go wrong?!"
1,RETURNED IT!,"We purchased this bed for an extra for when the kids come over. Nice looking, but don't let looks deceive you. By the morning, you won't have any air in your bed."
1,Not realistic,"I was very disappointed with this book. I took 2 books it was ITALY DISCOVERY JOURNAL I turned to and it is the one my kids enjoyed the most. Pat had great insight about how to make your kids part of the experience, they will always remember this trip as with ITALY DISCOVERY JOURNAL they were part of the decisions."
2,"Loved This one, but I hated the ""Ark Of Truth.""","Unlike Ark Of Truth this movie was very good, I loved the story line, the acting was great and seeing Jack again was the icing on the cake. If you know a bit about Stargate but never really watched most of the episodes you can still really enjoy this movie as it is a self contained story. Unfortunetly it still has Ben and Claudia in it but this time they somehow manage to not be so dominating and distracting.I would have given it 5 stars if they could have changed the timeline even more so that Ben and Claudia where still doing Farscape and the SGC was back to it's orginal cast."
2,Michele has done it again,The Things I Wish I'd Said is another winner with me. I could see these stories unfold either because of the imagery that Michele provided or in some cases reflections of my own past experiences. This books makes you think of the good and bad in the world in which we live. I recommend this book to any reader. I also want to thank Michele for another wonderful book.
2,Outstanding,"This is wonderful. I wish these folks were around, young, andon the Radio and Screen today. Put this on DVD PLEASE, my VHS tape will wear out fromintroducing todays kids to these folks."
1,WOW,"Watching this movie after having read the book is pretty much hell. The fact that they changed the whole plot from the book makes it seem like a joke. Then the ""special effects"" just made it even worse. Even if you haven't read the book and you don't know the real story, the movie was still horribly directed and filmed. There are no transitions, and the actors don't seem to realize they are all in one movie together. They all have their own accents and the only thing they have in common with the characters they are playing from the book is their names. The only reason anyone should ever watch this movie is out of complete boredom and a need to make fun of something."
1,made me ashamed to have served,"This is the first time that I've ever felt so compelled to write a review for a movie I thought was horrible. But this movie is that bad.I can't believe someone actually enjoyed this.The one liners, and that whole rock candy thing??? What was that all about? Was that supposed to be funny?Who wrote this anyway? He should be tried in a criminal court for waisting my money and my time.The acting was also some of the worst I've seen. I will never be able to watch Terminator 2 again.Oh, the explosions were impressive. Maybe if you took away everything but the explosions it wouldn't be too bad.Thanks. I feel a little ""dumber"" for having sat through the whole thing."
2,"Underated album, probably my favorite Oasis cd","I don't know why this album is regarded as one of Oasis's lesser albums. In my opinion it is their best album, and tends to be the album in which I still listen to the most. It is probably Oasis's hardest most heavy album with songs like ""My Big Mouth"", ""I hope, I think, I Know"", ""it's gettin better man"", and ""D'you Know what I mean"". Th album has more of a rock feel than a pop feel than ""What's the Story Mourning Glory"". I feel that every song on this CD are great rock songs. Give it a listen because it is the best album Oasis has put out."
1,Worst Movie Ever Made,"If you've ever seen the original you'll know that this film is anything but good. The story arc is poor, there is a total lack of character motivation, and the script seems as if they wrote it as they went along. Very little care was paid to the story when bringing this film to the screen. The only care seems to have been for the special effects. I want my two hours back."
2,1984 defines our distrust for government,"The book is a fantastic read of Orwell's projection of a future in which three totalitarian governments (all equivalent) rule the earth. I would say the book has two sections, the story, which follows an Outer Party member's struggle to rebel, and philosophy, which is Big Brother's Manifesto (or, one could say, Goldstein's but really they are one and the same). The book puts the story on hold when Winston, the protagonist, reads the manifesto; I would say that there is flow problem with the abrupt nature of this switch. Certainly the Manifesto is endemic to the book and provides another perspective and history of the rise of Oceania, the state in which Winston lives."
2,Nice alarm,So much about carbon monoxide poisoning these days..decided to get a few alarms for protection. Easy to install and work great...
1,a lot of useless information (within the total of 754 pages),"This is the kind of book which asks to be read for hours and hours AND then you go on double check on the internet. E.g. the list of hotels in Santa Cruz refers to the type of traveler who loves to spend more than $250 per night - tripadvisor.com offers a different picture...While planning a tour I'm looking for a tour guide which gives me distances on the map, smaller maps with an overview about an area or town (not only for SF or Yosemite) and more background information than the frequent use of adjectives (""breathtaking"" ""the world's most spectacular"").There is a lot in this book BUT..."
2,I love Elizabeth Speare,"This is the best book I have ever read. I will read it again and again. Mrs. Speare writes so well. Read it to find out. I'm not really writing a review, just stating my opinion ;)"
2,Does what it's supposed to do,"Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Keeps warm beverages warm. No, it will not heat a cold cup of coffee nor will it keep your beverage at scalding temperatures. But if you put your mug on it will your drink is still at least lukewarm, this doo-dad will keep it warm enough so that it's still pleasant to drink. To give you an idea of how hot this thing gets, the plate is warm enough that it *could* burn you if you left your hand on it, but will not burn with a quick touch."
1,Horrible film.,"This film is utterly horrible. Gore shoots from the creatures and women as if propelled from a pressure washer, the creatures somehow rip several of the women to shreds without their teeth coming into contact with flesh, their movements look ridiculous as they are not actually moving more quickly but the film rate is, the ""monsters"" are on camera far too much and end up looking silly rather than scary, a woman accidentally kills a companion in the heat of battle and is judged, crippled and left for dead by another of the group, a dream/gotcha ending, and a nonexistent plot.I am a fan or horror movies, but this one is just not good. It starts off with a compelling story and then ends up being a slasher flick with characters so annoying, protagonist included, that you cannot wait for them to die. Although a lot of time and money was spent on special effects, it is not a redeeming factor. As an obscure military leadership saying goes, ""You can't polish a turd."""
2,Love Baby Dry!,Great product and will continue to use this over the Dry Max! I would recommend this product to any mother! Will continue to order this brand until my son grows out of diapers!
2,kewl!,"The movie the Odessey was a very very good movie. It was very well writen and acted out. I saw this movie during my History class at school. The actors did and axcellent job in acting out this movie. They made me feel like I was in the movie with them the whole time. My favorite god was Aeolus. He was very funny. Odysseus was played by Armand Assante. He was a very good actor. My favorite part in the whole movie is when Odysseus and Teemachus kill all of the kings that had come to marry Odysseus' wife, Penelope. The only thing wrong with the whole movie was the sexual content. There was no nudity but there were a few love seens. The special effects are awesome. But there are a few boring parts when the people were talking."
1,pure formula junk,"This is the kind of film I get stuck watching on long plane rides and would NEVER seek myself. It is such silly schlock that I marvel at how the Hollywood mill can churn these things out and make money - it's really an industrial production process, geared to superficial viewers.This is one of the basic plots. THe others include crippled boy, whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk, love, or talk. Why do we keep watching this junk? A video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome.OK, here goes: beautiful girl with a dream, seeking big break, gets gig in a bar, handles it, meets boy who doesn't fit into plans, shakes it, shakes it more, shakes it a lot more, flirts with corruption, stays course, makes real friends, gets to know real self, grows. Oh, and then succeeds on her own terms.Not recommended. Admittedly, the acting in not abysmal, but what a waste of time about lives that could never exist."
1,Save your money.,"I am a big fan of foreign movies. When I read read the reviews listed here, I decided to see this movie before buying the DVD. Thank goodness. The storyline was terrible."
1,A Magazine for Kids Not For Professionals,"Purchased a digital subscription and regret it. A magazine for kids who like to look at pretty pictures. Unfortunately 95 percent fluff. Very little solid info. Lacking instructive content, but often has pretty photos of cars and of pretty girls, if that is what you like. Mostly advertising, I wouldn't wast the money on it again."
1,Twenty Thousand,"I really disliked this book. I think some of it has to do with the fact that the lines were off on some of the sentences throughout the book which made it more difficult. This is a great story, very imaginative but painful to get through unless you are a marine biologist."
2,True Bionic Serum,"The title say it all. This Exuviance-Vespera Bionic Serum the only brand I trust to my skin. I'm using this product for about ten years now my skin looks youthfull than ever. I'm glad this product is always available. I recommend this to my friends and family, after only few applications they notice the amazing results on their skin. I thank the company for marketing a real skin care that trully works. I will not use other product except this Vespera Bionic Serum.Marietta Parry Exuviance - Vespera Bionic Serum"
2,Comprehensive food guide,"Having just recently started the Atkins program I've grown tired of reading labels. However, it's vital to do so! This is a comprehensive guide detailing all kinds of information one needs in order to better plan meals.It evens gives listings of fast food restuarants! I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to count calories, fat grams, protein and most importantly Carbs. It details serving sizes and gives varying measurements. Get this book - it's been good for me."
1,Disappointing,"I started to read ""The Greatest Generation"" in the hope that it would contribute to World War II history. I really cannot say it did. I also found it to be repetitive. I also challenge the notion of the World War II generation being the ""greatest generation"" because of the patriotism it displayed. We have had individuals display similar patriotism throughout our history, especially since World War II. A recent example is Pat Tillman, the Arizona Cardinal Safety who give up millions to join the Army Rangers and gave his life in Afghanistan. I also find it interesting that Mr Brokaw admires the World War II generation for its patriotism yet objected to his fellow journalists wearing the American flag."
1,Huge talents in a poor poor movie,"Awesome special effects, great set, and a group talented actors,but the film didn't reach expectations. The script and story was so bad that not even Entrapment's Catherine Zeta Jones, and Episode I Liam Neeson couldn't save the movie. Sometimes the movie gets interesting vand you get into it, but that's just a start, the ending messes up the movie."
1,Stay away from U3,"My flash drive stopped working after I plugged it on a Windows Vista machine. After that, I couldn't even format it. I had to install and uninstall U3 three times to (luckly!) revive it. This drive now is in probation mode until I can trust on it again to keep important data.Just google ""u3 cruzer format problem"" and you'll understand the problem."
2,"Irish traditional folktales with wit, humor and light.","The book is appealing on many levels. It has fantasy,mystery, myth and abundant humor. Most of the tales aremythical in nature. Some are fabricated tall tales.The writing is excellent, with rich detail expressed interse language. A delight from cover to cover."
2,Woburn: Forgotten Tales & Untold Stories,"I purchased this book hoping to find some history of the town that one of my ancestors Samuel Richardson, helped found. Although there was little mention of people from my direct line, this was an extremely interesting read of the history after the town was founded in 1630. The history and characters are real and the various chapter authors did an excellent job of researching facts and putting them into facinating stories. This book gave me a better understanding of what several generations went through in order to make Woburn what it is today. This would be a great read for anyone interested in the early history of the United States."
1,Unreliable.. Wears out >>>,"I bought this item through Amazon. If you sit next to it you can tell by the smell that it's working slightly. But, it isn't real abundant and it wears out quickly. It's not as powerful as they claim. I would have bought a different cleaner and actually am looking for a different one to replace this one. I need something stronger. My room is only 10 X 10 that it is in...hardly can tell it works."
1,Could be a great book....,This could be a great book. A lot of wrong answers in the chapter quiz area. This could lead to a lot of confusion in a subject that is confusing enough on its own (that is why we bought the book in the first place...right?).
1,Horrible!,"Only 4 of the Columbia shorts, one with Curly and three with Shemp. The rest is the cartoon version, Ted Healy shorts with one, two, or three or three of the stooges, and a terrible, amateur documentary. Even the box listing the cast is wrong on the Columbia shorts. It lists Curly Joe DeRita as the star of all of them. Run away from this product, or don't pay more than $2 for it."
2,Great read,Exciting story of survival that will keep you wanting to read more with each chapter. A very well told true story!
2,Totally AMAZING!!,"Booker T. Washington not only exposes the evil of slavery, but the impeccable will of thoseparalyzed by it to fight for and enjoy the freedoms they never should've been denied to beginwith."
1,Slept like a baby...,"I watched this flick at 1 a.m. Afterwards, I had no trouble falling asleep. When is Hollywood going to realize that showing too much emphasis on visuals makes bad theater? Overdone, bombastic,predictable,CGI effects. The house looked too much like a gaudy museum with ridiculous fixtures. On the positive side,though, the sound effects were great. The bass notes were very well done, subtle shades of ghostly children whispering and eerie creaky sounds throughout the house were the real jewel in this film."
2,Where to buy this cheap,"I have only read part of this book so far (and loved it), but the reason I am writing this, is to let people know that it is $2.99 at The Christmas Tree Store. I bought 4, so if my family is reading this, you'll have a good idea of what you are getting next year."
2,It's Nelly's Year,I think the album is tight. The album Sweatsuit has some of his best songs on it from his Sweat and Suit albums. It also has 3 new songs on it.Go cop this Sweatsuit album.
2,Great Deal,"Everything came & looked as promised. The packaging left a little to be desired as I did see ones in stores that were in prettier boxes, but the prices were a lot higher, so overall...it's great!"
2,One of the best chick flicks ever,"Diane Lane is perfect. Plays the full range of female - bold, timid, snotty, exuberant and everything in between. Watch it!"
1,Julia,"I had great hopes for this film, it was after all an Oscar winner, but I now understand why the film was not widely available. I found it disjointed. There seemed to be a lot of time spent shouting down the telephone and smoking cigaretes which would be fine if the conclusion satisfied me, it didn't.The main Character, played by Jane Fonda, seemed naive and hopeless, the title character, played by Vanessa Redgrave was such an enigma that she was unbelievable in substance and played far to minor a role in the film. The only reason that I would like to know what happened next is simply to find out if any strength of resolve would be found! I think probably not."
2,Handy little pocket reference,"I purchased this to put in my camping supplies. I found myself pulling it out frequeuntly to use around the house. I think I'm gonna buy another.Pros:solid, waterproof constructionextremely helpful collection of knotsinstructions are clear and easy to followCons:none"
2,Essential Dolly Parton,"Dolly has described this CD as her ""Blue Mountain"" CD. Part Bluegrass, part mountain music. This is as good as it gets. Dolly never fails to deliver and if you are a Dolly fan or a fan of good music in general, you will not be disappointed."
1,Robocop 3- Protect the innocent from this movie!!,"""Ahh finally, robocop 3"" was the first thought that popped up in my mind as I sat down in my room to watch the movie. I loved the two first movies (Peter Weller is awsome as Murphy/Robocop) and I was really excited to see him in action again, wearing the metal plated armour suit... But wait a minute? What is this? No Peter Weller? Damn, well hope I live through this... I barely came out alive of my room that night...This is perhaps one of (maybe the worst) ""3rd movie in a series of good movies""-films I have ever encountered... The Plot is bad,probably written by a five-year old child, the actors disgusts me, reminds me of bad soap-opera acting, and the whole thing smells like a movie for children... I can only say one thing about this movie: If you love Robocop 1 & 2 and have no experience with this movie, well, do not see it, okay?! It will ruin your life... It has ruined mine..."
2,PT's Anesthetize...,"Incredible Band !! Incredible performance !! Being a long time PROG fan...Dream Theater, Rush , P Tree, Tool..etc... I love this DVD/Blu-Ray...Looks and sounds great on my new 59"" plasma.. Get it, You won't be disappointed. !! TV not included..sorry.."
1,Horrible,"This DVD is a waste of money. I brought this DVD based on the 5 STARS reviews; the reviewers must be Lisa's friends and associates. There are no instructions for variations of levels. The DVD says so many reps for beginners, intermediate, and advance; but, there are no cues as to when and what levels should be doing what. There is no consideration for a learning curve or alternate ways of doing certain routines. There are way too many breaks for such a short workout routine. I purchases this DVD for an intense workout at home when I am unable to go to the gym; will have to invest in another Kettlebell workout. Lisa is making hand over fist on this DVD at the buyers expense."
2,Combat really combats German roaches,"From holidays in a Near East country I brought back spices which were contaminated by coakroaches. For over half a year I tried everything to get the roaches out of my house. No remedy helped really and I got desperated in the end. Then I came across ""COMBAT"" and since 2 weeks of using the product the number of insects is going rapidly down. There is hope that COMBAT will destroy the roaches completely."
2,Works Perfectly,Had trouble with another wireless adapter so I bought the TIVO branded adapter. It works great and has been downloading all mh TIVO content with no problems.
1,"This is a FIRST EDITION REPRINT, not the latest 9th edition","If you want a copy of the original 1940s edition, that is what this is. The Amazon webpage makes it look like you are buying a paperback copy of the most recent hardcover, but that's not the case.I purchased this item and will be returning it, not because the the 2007 edited version is so great, but because this edition doesn't even have the benefit of the original authors correcting their own work based on feedback and review!!"
1,wow what a bomb,i am sorry to say that this album really changed my opinion of clay aiken. This album is horrible and if you want to know why there are so many used copys available to buy you'll know after listening to this. I want Ruben Studdard
2,They didn't live happily every after,"Faith Wish is a great book that mature teenaged girls can relate to. AnneMarie, a beautiful, 17-year-old underachiever, has been put on an academic contract and will not graduate with her high-school class - to her dismay. When she attends a tabernacle meeting led by Brother Jackson, a charismatic, handsome self-proclaimed minister, she becomes a true Christian. After discovering she is pregnant with Brother Jackson's child, she turns to him for help, and he takes her to a spiritual redemption camp to find guidance. There, she sheds her old skin and past sins, including sex, drugs, and smoking. Unfortunately, all does not end well, as she struggles to find answers to her dilemna."
1,"I thought I was going to love this album, but didn't","I really enjoyed Clay on AI2, was one of the first in line to preorder the album, and was really looking forward to receiving it. However, I was very disappointed. Not so much in Clay, but in the song selection. In fact, when I have it on, I have noticed so many of the songs sound alike, I have trouble identifying which one he is singing. They don't have the ""inspired"" feel that his voice can deliver. After listening to the album several times now, I'm giving up. I doubt it will hit my CD player again.I hope Clay has a long career and reaches a broad audience base, but in the words of Simon Cowell, ""It didn't do it for me...."""
2,Gorgeous Drawings and Fun Poem,"Way out in the Desert, by Marsh and Ward, illustrated by Spengler, is a counting book featuring hidden numbers within spectacularly colored drawings of desert animals and their habitat. The verse is in rhyme and can be sung to ""Over in the Meadow,"" and the musical accompaniment is provided in the back of the story. I kind of chant this one to the kids and at the end of each page they look for the numbers hidden in the picture. Featuring plant and animal species which are native to the southwestern desert habitat, this book shows kids new animals they may not have seen before."
1,for the ASIN 1604241438 edition,"This review is ONLY for the edition noted above. Most editions of this book are facsimiles of earlier editions. You can download the book from google for free. Exact same text and layout. I ordered this item (the ASIN 1604241438 version) twice at $4.96 (I see now its about $15) and both times the cover arrived rather bent. The reprint is worth 5 dollars, because it is just a bound version of the PDF you could download from google."
1,non-stick coating peel off after 6 month,"I don't like this rice cooker because the inner pot's non-stick coating peel off after 6 month, and there's no way to replace it. My last Panasonic rice cooker's non-stick coating lasted 5 years."
1,"Save your money for your real ""dreams""","Ms. Browne seems to be well meaning when describing her experiences and her dreams and those of others. However, the books spends more time discussing Ms. Browne's views about herself rather than focusing on the more interesting information about dreams themselves.It is obvious from reading the book that Ms. Browne is a lay person and a ""spiritual guide"", not a scientist of any kind. I would venture to guess that most of the information she provides is based on her own opinions and conjecture rather than hard, sounds facts.I was very disappointed with this book, and only ""dream"" of getting my money back . . ."
2,I never learn how to sew these videos help,These videos are fabulous my daughters and I learned how to sew using only these videos. My daughters have surpassed me in sewing. I thank God for Pam's williness to use her skill to make videos for those who never was taught the skill of sewing. May God bless her business.
1,Another Warners Archive Collection Bust,"As with They Only Kill Their Masters, another recent purchase, this DVD is from the Warners Archive Collection. Here is the statement from this website concerning this title:Important Note: This film has been manufactured from the best-quality video master currently available and has not been remastered or restored specifically for this DVD and Digital Download release. Click here to preview this film's video quality.Had I realized this fact, I would not have purchased this DVD from Amazon."
1,Molly Myers,"Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence."" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM ""pacifists"" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep ""innocent Palestinians"" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme."
2,READ MULTIPLE TIMES! EXCELLENT!,"This is the best true-crime book ever written, imho. I actually read this in high school in the 1970s and did a book report on it for one of my history classes (got an ""A""). It seemed like none of the other kids had ever heard of Manson or his ""family"". I read this book so many times the cover was in pieces. If you want to read a scary, gory, and TRUE book that will scare you, don't bother with any of the other books out there. Read this one. It will give you chills to realize how much control one man can have over other people. Of course, since the time of the Tate/LaBianca murders, we have been desensitized because of the Jim Jones, David Koresh, and other cults... But Manson's directives started them all. Very well written."
1,Overrated,"One would think that when spending nearly $200 that is claimed for a book that is claimed to be the be all and end of all courses on its subject it would have at the very least been carefully edited. What you get are two looseleafs into which you insert several hundred typed pages that are replete with spelling and grammatical errors. And, while there is useable material here, you are paying $197 for a thinly veiled manual of huckstering numerous software programs which either pay Internet Market Center commissions or that they own outright. Much of this software is buggy, troublesome and poorly supported, and for the most part much better can be found elsewhere. Same for this so-called course. There is much better out there for much less. Among the numerous worthwhile sources of material are Webonomics, and Make Your Site Sell. Avoid this one despite what IMC's shills want you to believe with their rave reviews."
2,Of Mice And Men,I thought that is book was very good. It was mostly about friendship between two friends name lennie and George. Lennie is the retarded one and George takes care of him. Cause lennie mom and dad die when he was a little boy. They both have a dream to own there own land. There dreams very come true because George shots lennie. If George didn't shot lennie then the police would kill him because he hurt a girl in the weeds. Weeds is the name of the town that they use to live. But they had to move because what lennie had done to the girl. Now they work on the ranch. Lennie can't talk that well but he is strong like a bull. George is the smart one he takes care of lennie. George gets mad lennie cause George buys lennie a puppy but lennie is so strong that when he pets the puppy they puppy dies. At the end of the book George shot lennie for lennie good. There dreams never came true.
1,disappointing read,"Yes it is truly amazing what the man accomplished andI cannot take anything away from his feat.His book, on the other hand, I was sorry that I bought.After the first 3 chapters I gave up. Barely making itout of the desert. Maybe I'll pick it up at a later datebut I just got tired of ""Day 1: I ran"", ""Day 2: I ran"",""Day 3:I ran, it rained""... yawn.I need a book to convince my wife to hike for more than10 days at a stretch and this fell far short.Not recommended"
2,Surprising ...,"This is not a depiction of the ins and outs of the political aspect of Queen Victoria's reign. It is a love story where balancing duty with depth of feeling, professional with personal relationship, is fully fleshed out.All actors involved deliver great performances. Great chemistry between the lead actors makes the story come alive. It was wonderful to picture the castle, which looks so cold and austere from the outside, as the home of a warm and loving and joyful family. Children gleefully running through the halls on holidays. A father playing with his children. A mother looking on with shining eyes.This movie shows the personal side to the monarchy. It was a delight to watch. I hated to see it end.Add it to your DVD library and prepare yourself for a few hours of total enjoyment."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this game because my friend said it was excellent, however he's never been a very good gamer, I thought the no resource management idea was ok, but it ruins half the point of an RTS, and strategy is all about careful management of resources to fund your army, because, if you dont have any resources, you dont have an army ;-) I'd say ok for someone who doesn't really know how to play a REAL RTS, but if your an expert, I'd save up for Warcraft 3:The Frozen Throne, and if you haven't got the normal Warcraft 3, go buy it!"
1,I hate useless products,"You have to buy most of the battle chips seperatly which leeches your cash in no time, don't bother. Get a Game Boy or a Nintendo DS if you want handheld fun."
2,Sho and Jean are good together,"When I first saw this movie had no idea that JCVD was going to be in it.I knew that Sho was.Sho always does great movies .Sometime they are alittle ""campy"" but the fight scenes are always good.JCVD really out classed Sho in this one.I give them both 10's anyway.The way that they interact make you think that they should make more together,but that was at the end of Sho's movie days and the beginning of Jean's.I think that anyone who wants to see a good movie will like this one.It's not just a martial arts movie."
2,Excellent product,"These Alphabet blocks are so beautiful they could be classed as works of art or collectors items. I have purchased two seys as gifts and will probably buy more,"
2,great pampers,I use those diapers for years. They are good for my daughter and other babies. This one is bought as a gift for our friend.
1,design flaw,"The diapers design has a big flaw and when we tie him up, those ties ups are of plastic and very think causing rash to infant son's weights. I hate these diapers... Thanks."
1,A poster? Really?,"This ""poster"" looks like someone took pictures of a larger poster and cut and pasted sections together. Very disappointing!"
1,Narnian History Rewritten by Hollywood,"I gave this installment of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" two stars only because of the special effects. The story really departed from the book and could have been much better had it followed the book more closely. In the book, Prince Caspian was a young boy, NOT an adult. The Disney folks only made him an adult so they could work in a love interest with Queen Susan. I don't object to a love interest in a movie if it belongs. In this case, it was totally uncalled for. Finally, too many scenes were taken out that were in the book. For example, Aslan's romp with Bacchus and the Mynaids. Other scenes were substituted that were not in the book at all, such as the over-long battle scene in King Miraz's castle. In this installment of the Narnian Chronicles, Disney has rewritten history. For shame, Disney!"
2,Love these,I had looked all over Houston for these and could not find them. They are just what I wanted.
2,"This is a nice portable heater,for the office,or den..Is quiet,and good for spot heating.","This portable heater is good for use in your office, den or sleeping area..It is quiet and efficient,and is good for spot heating...please keep away from drapes or rugs,and small children,who might mistake this heater for a toy...Otherwise this is a good deal...Mine came with a remote to adjust setttings more easily...4 star rated..."
1,Not worth it,"I had to read this book for school. I, personally, don't care for any type of science fiction, so that could play a part in my rating, but it was very confusing and not worth my time. The book is about Guy Montag who is a fireman from three or four hundred years in the future where firemen cause fires instead of putting them out. The book mentions people Montag meets and is friends with and about his failing relationship with his wife. There are many 'futuristic' objects in this book which keeps you thinking and confused. The book ends in a chase which was by far the best part. If you don't enjoy science fiction, I do not recommend this book for you. I only read it because it was required of me."
2,So glad i didn't give up on crusie quite yet...,"This is definitely one of her better reads. It has a hint of mystery to it, and not to much of her love making writing...."
2,Good metal.,"They are no doubt talented in their genre of music. Very fast paced music as always, this CD is full of hardcore guitar riffs. I can't help but to always picture a crazy mosh pit involved in every one of their songs. If I were to choose a single song to decide whether or not to buy this CD, I would pick the song ""Last Breath"". Some good metal. Rhapsody categorized this album as well as Hatebreed in general under ""Metalcore"". Remember that if you are going to buy this album, this is Hatebreed so expect a whole lotta screaming. Hatebreed to me is the official ""head banging, mosh pit"" band of today, and this album definitely shows it. It even comes with a poetic title."
2,Enjoying my Tivo,I have to say..I am so enjoying my Tivo service thanks to the uSB wireless adapter. Without it I would not be able to watch or have Tivo service
2,Fabulous,I bought the pillow covers and the mattress covers and they are great. They wash and dry well and do exactly the job they should.....protecting pillows and mattresses.
2,Blackened Thrash and Extreme Cold,"This is my second attempt at writing a review for ATHOW. I don't know what happened to the first one. But, I'm sure none of you really care!! HAHA. ATHOW is very close to being the best metal record I own. The guitar work by Abbath is bone-crushing, and the drumming by Horgh is phenominal. But, the real excellence is Peter Tagtgren's production. He brings to life what these musicians are conveying. Superb. Immortal have created an amazing metal ""fantasy"" with all their records. Brilliant. Immortal is now reforming and will open the Wacken Festival in Germany in 2007. Be there if you can, if not buy this and ""Sons of Northern Darkness."""
1,This device is the worst ever,if its not tranferring the wrong music... its freezing up.. or not liecening properly.. or the device itself sticks(dail to select with). this is my third sansa and will be my last
2,The girl simply shines with the 4 guys!!!! wow,"Okay, let's be objective, A NEW DAY HAS COME was a fine album, ONE HEART was simply the crappiest Celine album ever, but now she brings us this piece of art for those who appreciate her french music .. her roots. This album was targeted mainly for french and Canadian people, but it's topping the charts all over Europe, because of its quality!It is a musical piece of art which combines folk with blues and some irish shades. With tremendous guitar arrangements played by the amazing Gildas Arzel each song turns into a living nostalgia.Her voice is relaxed as it's never been, and she doesn't try to force it to hit high notes.. she just sings with her heart.even if u don't speak french, u'll love this album for its musicality!!!!!!!!! GO AND BUY IT -WON'T REGRET"
1,Scandelous and Preposterous!!!!!!,"And I am a recovering Catholic now Episcopalian! Also,a registered Democrat with moderate to liberal views!Part of the argument we on the religous ""left"" as it were have with those on the far religous ""right"" is that they seem to want everything clearly outlined and defined. Like taking the bible verbatim. With the exception of the ten comandments when was anything said in the Bible or by Jesus as clear as a bell??????That is we, on the left think the Bible was divine inspiration not divine dictation. There is just no way the Mother of God would clearly say all the things the 3rd secret is suppose to reveal and so clearly in the syntax of the day now in the 21st century!!!!!It was an interesting point that the author had Clement be a pope of German birth and the book was probably started long before Benedict's election. The stuff on St. malachy's predictions was interesting too althought probably a fraud."
2,Turistas,"This turned out to be a really good movie! I actually saw this movie for sale in Blockbuster for $5 months ago, but after reading the description of it, chalked it up to being another edition of Hostel. Only recently when it came on cable did I realize that it is much, much better than Hostel."
1,Disgrace of a book for anyone who studies the Amish writings,"2 stars is pretty generous, in my opinion. This book seemed more like a book about the process she went through writing a book about visiting Amish families. I found myself wondering where I might be able to find the book she spent so much time ""pouring her soul into"". The book is largely spent talking about how incredible she is for having completed such a daunting task and is filled with many backhanded remarks regarding Amish communities. She comes off pompous and self-indulgent, not at all like the humbled, pious woman she paints herself out to be. Would recommend skipping this book."
1,Waste of money,"These ear gels were supposed to fit easily on the Jabra Bluetooth that I have, but they don't stay on at all once they were placed on it. I was hoping the contoured shape would hold in my ears, but it just proved to be very uncomfortable."
1,Over rated and too politically correct,"I wonder if only the good reviews get notice or do the people who don't care for it much take the time to comment on it. Not worth the effort,couldn't finish it."
2,My TiVo's now connected!,"This network adaptor for the TiVo was about the same price as other brands of adaptors but made specifically for TiVo. I was very confused trying to figure out which other adaptor would work with which TiVo, this made it simple to choose. The software and instructions on the TiVo website made it simple to get started. It was EASY to get my TiVo connected to my home network and now not only can I transfer shows to my computer, I can burn them to DVD as well as having access to my pictures and music through the TiVo. It works well and expanded the uses of both my computer and TiVo. I would recommend this to anyone who has a home network and a TiVo!"
1,"Not original hit versions, yet nowhere does jacket or CD say so","I've owned this CD for a few years, yet thought something was slightly off, so I compared ""Keep A Knockin"" to another copy I have.Results:Original is 168 beats per minutes, while this version is 172 beats per minute.Original's time is 2 min. 23 seconds; this version is 2:16 min."
1,IN THE TRASH IT GOES!!!!!,"Hello! I am a woman nearing my 60s, and my waist certainly isn't getting any smaller! I purchased this product in the hopes that it would shrink my ever-growing belly. To accommodate for my girth, I bought the Squeem ""Magical"" Lingerie Shapewear in XXXXX-Large, the largest size available. WELL, here's a bit of magic for ya, sisters. The second I snapped the first two hooks together, the tightness was unbearable. It felt like it was squeezing my waist fat straight down to my giant ass. Fortunately, the discomfort didn't last long, since the hooks flew off and therefore ruined the Squeem altogether. These things need to come in larger sizes. Not even worthy of 1 star. More worthy of steaming diarrhea."
2,20 Questions,"This is a very good version of 20 Q with a vast data bank. The only problem I can find is that it can't guess itself as the thing you're thinking of! You can set sound on/off (just beeps); answer yes, no, sometimes, or unknown; and the set speed of the scrolling. When it asks you what type of thing it is, things that are normally vegetable (like ""chair"" if it's made from wood, ""paper"", ""maple syrup"") fall under the ""other"" category. ""Vegetable"" only holds vegetables (parsley, spinach...)."
1,Does not work with Windows XP,"The device is rated as Windows XP compatable, but it is not. After fruitless hours of trying to get this piece of garbage installed I gave up. Simpletech's web site and tech support are a joke! All I ended up with was constant crashes and error messages. Save your money."
1,Great coverage...lousy quality,"The NBC coverage offered in these videos is fascinating to watch as it shows a tragic, unfolding event as it was covered live in 1963. NBC's coverage was in black and white, except for brief segments early on from WBAP-TV in Fort Worth. The only problem with the videos is the actual video quality...which is lousy. THIS VIDEO IS NOT AN OFFICIAL NBC RELEASE. THE MATERIAL DID NOT ORIGINATE DIRECTLY FROM THE NBC NEWS ARCHIVES. IT IS A BOOTLEG. NBC only released one such video of its JFK coverage, a capsulized version back in 1988 which contains almost none of the coverage seen in this collection. This material is of marginal quality at best...and looks like it ewas copied about eight times before being released in this version. If you're not concerned about this, then you will find it very interesting to watch."
2,great handbook,i'm a student of applied chemistry and this book has everything you need too know as undergraduate of statistical thermodynamics
1,Name I know but....,"This thing was a waste of my money.Thought that this item would be a good buy because of the brand since I have a coffee pot that is over 10 years old and has been with me longer than anything I own,but I was wrong.It won't even keep a cup of coffee warm not to even mention hot.Save your money wait till around Christmas time and get one at the dollar stores or someplace."
1,Please List the Tracks,Can someone please list all the tracks from this album. There are some real Crystal fans out here looking for a good collection. Is this it?
2,A compact and well written book.,The proofs are well structured and easy to follow. The techniques used in the proofs lend themselves for use in other situations. A lot of information is embeded in the exercises which keep the students alert and focused and at the same time saves time and space. A good book for undergraduates in mathematical analysis.
2,very satisfied,have nothing negative to say about this product. Very please!delicious satisfying I use these every day and I have no problems with any leakage from the product. Thanks for such a marvelous product.
2,a fine read,It was really good but Ramsey was hardly in it and it bothered me his appearance was only described as handsome and nothing more. And the girl was so dumb if she'd stop declaring her love for Brodick for two seconds maybe she'd realize she was married. But she was cool apart from that flaw. I liked where the story went.
2,Handy Device,"Very compact, well made, helps me level the camera when I set it on sloped surfaces and it stays in place due to the rubber feet. For the price and size it's a great alternative."
1,I didn't know they wrote so many songs,"I bought this album just for one song, their cover of ""There Goes My Baby"". The rest of the songs are okay."
1,HEARD IT ALL BEFORE,YOU KNOW SOMETIME HIS MUSIC ALL SOUNDS THE SAME .DON'T GET ME WRONG HE IS VERY VERY TALENTED BUT THIS CD JUST REALLY DOES NOTHING 4 ME IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMTHING THAT HE HAS DO BEFORE HE JUST REMASTERD IT .TRY AGAIN KELLY BECAUSE YOU DID NOT PULL THE SHEETS OVER MY HEAD WITH THIS ONE.
1,Not my favorite Poitier film,"I think the point of this film is about faith. Everyone likes a good miracle movie. Right? Well, not quite. There was plenty of cringe worthy moments regarding race. Mr. Ashton calling Homer 'boy' and then telling the nuns that Smith was lazy and shiftless-but still wanted him to work for him. (Weird.) I hated the scenes where he was just shuffling to please them. And I didn't understand why Mother Maria simply couldn't say 'Thank You' especially when she was begging for everything. Out of all the good roles Poitier has played, they give him the Oscar for when he played a good field slave doing what he was told. Whatever."
2,Beautiful and Inspiring,truly beautiful film that captivates the audience. I have watched it several times over and still continue to be inspired by it. Truly a must have in the collection for those who love movies about Saints
2,Works like a charm,"For me, this is pretty much a sure thing. Sometimes I use the rotating beads. Sometimes I don't. It just depends on my mood. The rabbit vibration is stronger when the beads are turned off. The size of the item is pretty long/thick and I do prefer this size to some of the other items I have. My current favorite item. Haven't tested to see if it's waterproof ... too worried that it'll stop working and then I'll be SOL."
1,I got burned after few hours wearing it,"the first day,( 8 hours wearing it ) it hurt me so bad , my skin was torned, itched, swell, deep red. I tried to wear other side, after few hours, I got deep burned both on the right and left belly, the skin was torned, swell, bleeding, lot of cross cut on the skin, itched for a week until now. It looked like I was beaten up or have skin disease...I am scared to dead when I look at it now. I don't know why I got it , I used something like this before, but I didn't get any bad thing. or the rubber hurt me ?"
1,Sentimental & Depressing,"Was having a tough day when ordering this. Music from teenage years. These were songs I liked back in the day. However, compared to most of the other music I have or listen to, Oasis is a downer. If I can get past the depressing quality of the music, it's fine.Find different, less depressing music."
2,most delighting,I read this book in fourth grade and I still rember the wonderful book! I decided to read it again and it wa just as good as I thaught it would be!
1,"Other than the History of the breed, not specific to a Burmese Cat at all!","I must agree with the other reviewer that this book offers no additional eye-opening facts in respect to owning a Burmese cat... The history section is specific to the breed (but as a new or existing Burmese owner, you'd probably already know this prior to getting one!) & there is one blurb regarding the Burmese characteristic to yowl when they require attention. Beyond that this book could really be for any other cat out there (feed your cat, give it water, groom it,...). It didn't even specify normal size/weight ranges for the breed and what quantities of food to give them as a guideline. So, in my opinion, useless to a new Burmese owner. Also, I was a bit disappointed that all of the photos are only of Sable & Chocolate Burmese (they are all gorgeous, but a few photos of Blues or Lilacs would be appreciated). All in all this book was disappointing."
1,"Extremely cheap and poorly constructed, DO NOT BUY!","Everything about this scooter is incredibly cheap and shoddily put together. The seat broke under my weight (I weigh 165, well below the stated limit for this product) and half of the bolts holding the scooter together rattled themselves off within a few blocks of riding it. Do not, under any circumstances, waste your money on this inferior product."
1,BURN THIS BOOK!!!,I was FORCED to read this book in school! It was pure TRASH! I thought I liked reading... well now Idont! Thanks a lot Ray Bradbury!!!
1,Where's the rest?,"I've seen this in several of Kindle's Free Editions, all excerpts are missing! All the poems in Alice in Wonderland as well as Through the Looking Glass and now the manuscript in Baskervilles.Either the free editions are poorly edited before release (if indeed they are proofread at all) or (more likely) Amazon is releasing an incomplete product for free in order to force us to buy one of their fancy versions. I might understand if this were an author who is still around, but with the classics I think this is unacceptable."
1,Waste of money,Buying Pampers or Huggies is flushing your money down the toilet. Luvs work just as well at a fraction of the cost.
1,not a healthy product,"I started this a week ago and within one day of taking it as directed, i developed hives and full body rash. I know the possibility of these side effects was stated, but the degree is more extreme than expected. I stopped taking it on Tuesday and it is now Friday. The incredibility itchy rash continues. Use at your own risk."
1,JACK THE IDJIT,I think Three's Company is the WORST sitcom there EVER was on telivision. Bad writing BAD acting and JUST PLAIN BAD all the way around. The horrible thing was it was SO bad you sometimes felt compelled to watch it in spite of your better judgement. PAINFULLY stupid plots.
1,Poor Design,I would not buy this product or reccomend it. It is designed poorly and the different attachements don't stay on the charger. Disapointed withmoney spent
2,Thought provoking,"This movie makes a person consider the subject of Alien contact. I thought some of the alien depictions needed to be more realistic, but it showed real human emotion in the various situations that were presented in the story and the actors did preform their parts well."
1,Very disappointed,I am serving the military overseas ai expect delays over stateside deliveries. In this case the product did not arrive and I have contacted the seller through e-mail twice to let them know that the product never arrived. I have never heard back from the seller. Very frustrated.
2,Merry Christmas Charlie Brown,One of the best Christmas movies ever made the story is so true about everyone forgetting the real meaning of Christmas. I have the book and the movie and you can watch it all year I never get tired of it.
1,Wood chips off,The pieces of this puzzle are definitely no for kids..or even adults.Its made of poor quality wood and easily chips off.It chips off into such small pieces that can easily embed in anyone skin or even be eaten out of curiosity.Did not expect it from a M@D toy
1,Summer-Estate,"Anyone who hears this song and isn't mesmerized, then haunted, is deaf. I heard it in my car and almost wrecked. The most beautiful!"
2,This 20Q is Fantastic! Astounding! Amazing! and FUN,"If you are sitting at home and watching a television show you have seen 5 times before, pick up the 20Q for hours of fun instead. Whatever is on your mind this little computer guesser can figgure it out. From Lizzard to Poop it is all in here. Give in a try and you will be hooked!"
2,squeem,"I like it because it came as I was expecting that , and really helped to save money compare to other stores"
1,Horrible,This book was way too weird for me and there was never a hook of curiosity. I was assigned to read this for school so that is the only reason i continued to read to the end. It made no sense and was very dull.
2,This film has haunted me my whole life.,"I caught glimpses of this on cable as a kid, and those parts interspersed with ominous warnings from adults about this movie, have driven it to legendary status within my brain.I imagine scenes in my head now that aren't actually in the movie because Polanski is so masterful at suggesting more than is actually on the screen. This movie, along with Chinatown, shows Polanski is at his most suggestive and subtle.He absolutely reaches the ideal that Hemingway talked about with ""90% of the story submerged beneath the surface""--only Polanski does it on film in a way that no one else has done before or since.Hail Satan!Err..Hail Polanski!"
2,Heavy.,"Like it says, it's heavy duty. It feels thick and hefty when you place it onto the box. I use it to ship stuff, and it keeps the label water-tight, as well as affixes all sorts of things to plastic or cardboard shipping containers."
1,Love Aiken Disappointed in Measure of A Man,"I am still a fan of Clay Aiken because he has a beautiful voice. However, the song selection, style of his ""made-over"" voice was disappointing. I was looking forward to hearing that smooth sexy voice of American Idol songs he sang. It was not there. Whoever decided on these songs did no justice to Clay Aiken. Maybe next time... Sorry Clay."
2,Hilarious,"The great god Om chooses to speak to the humans of Discworld about their lack of faith, not through an angel, not in the form of a burning bush but in the form of a turtle, and not a GIANT TURTLE, more like a box turtle. Remember the movie Oh God? Now think about trying to convince the world god speaks through a tiny turtle. Yeah, and it just gets better, Sir Terry's wit will leave you in stitches- or maybe in traction when you throw something out of whack laughing."
2,"A tight, interesting thriller.","Timothy Hutton plays a Science Fiction author who, although he has written many novels, is best known for his first book about a song that haunted him. The song returns with a vengeance in the film and it is up to him to find a way to stop it from killing others. This was a nice tight thriller with fine acting by Hutton and David Kelly who may be familiar from Charlie and the Chocolate factory or Waking Ned Devine. It kept me guessing until the end (which is fairly hard to do). The background of beautiful Mediterranian locations make this a great movie to help escape from the summer heat."
2,Can it get better?,"Dave has outdone himself with this album. This is his third ""solo"" album on the independant label he runs in Iowa City called Trailer Records. Dave can sound like rock n roll, folk, Alt-Country, and bluesy among other unknown or unnamed styles. The Big Night explores these different musical styles and puts them together to form his unique sound. If you like Bob Dylan, Greg Brown, Todd Snider, The Rolling Stones, or any similar atists you should give this album a try."
2,"Not like the video game, but still fun!","This movie has received a lot of unfair criticism. Mostly, the problem is that this movie derrived from a video game. Some people dislike it because it comes from a video game and others hate it because it is too unlike the game. Admittedly, if there were some name and costume changes, this movie could be called something besides ""Super Mario Bros."".In any case, how good would the movie be if it featured a little plumber running through a bunch of turtles and jumping on to a flagpole? If it were too similar to the video game, many viewers would turn away (however, its unlikeness to the game has turned away some gamers). In any case, this movie is a lot of fun to watch. The characters are spirited and, as it says on the box, it's a blast to watch."
2,It's Gemini Time,"I love all of Brian McKnight's CDs, however ""Gemini"" to date is the Best!! From tracks #1 ""Stay with Him"" to #13 ""Me & You"" this project is some of the best R&B;, Inspirational & Gospel out there today.Thanks Brian!!"
1,Poor quality,Quality of these diapers is NOT same as other Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers (same size 5) that I have bought before. These diapers come with very small fasteners and so they don't stick well. Diaper comes off easily. This pack is economy in quality too. I can not believe this kind of product is made by Pampers!!! Will NOT buy this 144 pack again.
1,I don't believe Manson had anything to do with this.,"Ok, if your a Manson collector of course you have to have this, but otherwise it is not even a good read, let alone Manson's words.Buy it if you are collecting, but read Helter Skelter or the Family for a better read."
2,Human Contact,"The book tells of a time when the primary contact was person to person, with the family of Jim The Boy teaching him what he must learn in life. The era was before television, cell phones, ipods, PC's, texting, etc. Raised by his mother and three uncles they as a unit put their arms this boy to raise him into manhood, which on occasion involved the saying of No and punishment, but always with a point to make. I look forward to reading the sequel of Jim's march into adolescence."
2,"Ok, but not as good as the others","Choosers of the Slain is a decent book and a slightly new departure for the Paladin of Shadows series, as Mike takes to tracking a stolen womam through the western European white slave trade with the aid of a squad of his Keldara retrainers. The core store is sound and like the second book, it is a single story rather then three short stories the way the first book was. As with the other two books in the series, there are some fairly graphic sex scenes - a bit too much for my personal tastes as it happens - and lots of guns, violence, and women. Overall I enjoyed the book a great deal, but I do have to say that it wasn't as good as either the first or second book of the series."
2,"Beautiful, simply beautiful...","Summer of My German Soldier is an absolutely wonderful book. The emotions and phases that run through the mind of Patricia Bergen are so real, and perhaps a bit similar to my own at times, that you'd think that the Patty truly lived in every aspect of human life. Patty is at times naive, but is mostly brave, a might defient, and loving. I recommend this book to any fellow young lady from nine to seventeen. It's wonderful."
2,Amazing!,"This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of ""Prisoners of Fate"" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in ""A Distant Promise"" and ""Girl who Stole the Star"" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like ""Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~"", ""Time of the Dreamwatch"", and ""Chronomantique"" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars."
2,Fantastic,"Never has a book made me think so much and yet be absolutely terrified for the future. Ending is very bleak and gives one the impression that all hope is lost, but I still highly recommend it."
1,Very SLLLOOoowwww...ZZzzz,"This book could have easily been summed up in 30 pages! Not that I don't love attention to detail in stories, because I do, but F. 451 just dragged. It was a great concept and good plot but there was certain scenes where Bradbury overevaluated and overexplained everything! I'm never touching this book again."
1,Jawbone Repair Kit? Maybe,"In an odd case of poor quality control, the package of eargels came with two of one of the six sizes and missing one of the others. I bought them to make my Jawbone headset fit. It's better than it was, but still not ergonomic."
1,Don't buy this,Krishnamurti himself asked people not to pay attention to his immature teachings (prior to about 1933). For a scholar this book gives a look into K's mind as a youngster but it doesn't portray the important elements of his teachings which flourished after around 1933.
1,"Great Name, Inadequate Guage",Arrived fast but the product needed to be calibrated upon arrival. As a matter of fact I've been calibrating this one frequently and it's still lucky to get within 2 degrees of the actual temperature. It just requires too many adjustments and remains too inaccurate. It is big and readable and sticks to the window. Unfortunately this is a case of an inadequate product distributed by a well known name brand.
1,Cute but typical,"So-so at it's best. Great scenery. Good-looking men, but so typically ""chick-flick"" despite the true story. Diane Lane's character is a disillusioned divorcee who takes a trip to Italy and on a whim decides to buy a house in the local area. Intitially, there is frustration as the maintenance and upkeep of the house becomes overwhelming, but in time, her curious neighbors become very close friends and she eventually becomes intertwined in their cheerful lives. In a country where love and passion is so rampant, why does she feel so lonely? When wil her true amore come into her life?Cute flick, but not much depth to the story with very typical characters. The cinematography is lovely, though. Great flick for an empty afternoon."
1,Don't buy this printer!,The constant printer jams make this printer unusable! And don't buy the baloney that those of us having problems have not followed the manufacturer's directions. The thing jams with HP's own (expensive) paper no matter how many pieces of paper are in the tray.
1,Difficult,I wish this was broken into sections like the copy I borrowed from the library. It's kind of overwhelming the way it is printed without any breaks.
2,Excellent choice for all age groups,"We bought this for our son when he was 2 years old and now he's 5 and won't use any other swing set. I thought he would like a wooden one that was bigger, but he gets so much enjoyment from this one and it's durable, was easy to assemble (even for my husband) and he gets hours of enjoyment from it. We did anchor it into the ground because I was afraid it would tip over as he got older, but it works just fine and we're all happy, even mom!"
1,Sharks Walnut picture frame with emblem,"I ordered this item for a Xmas gift, however when we put the picture in with the matting it did not fit, the frame and glass were crooked so picture did not fit. However you could not see this in looking at the product only when you tried to fit the picture and matting together in the frame.Very disappointed in this item and would not order anything made by the Memory Company again. I have also contacted the Memory Company who makes this frame to see what their response will be."
1,Don't bother,"The pillow is tiny and poor quality foam, my pillow I was replacing was at least a year and a half old and it preforms better than this one did new."
2,They Wrote the Book on Transistor Radios,"One of the ""must haves"" if you are interested in transistor radios of the fifties and sixties. Hundreds, (thousands?) of listings with photos of some, descriptions of all, and date of manufacture for most. The book also contains estimated value ranges, and useful introductory information."
2,An adult sim,"I have enjoyed this game. It seems easy but you'll find yourself out of time or money before you have met your objectives. You don't feel cheated, it makes you want try again and again. Maybe no one will drown and perhaps you can even turn a profit. I'm looking forward to many hours of entertainment."
1,ive seen this before...........,"this is the worst comedy evericould tell this was an adam sandler movie right from the startit its a compilation of all the weak jokes from his past movies and albums, actors and songs put together to make a very dissapointing comedy. Had i known this movie was so bad, i hoped someone would have brought it TO MY ATTENTION YESTERDAY!!!!"
1,Ugh. This is horrible,"I'm shocked at all the good reviews I'm seeing! I'm a huge Queen fan, and have been since 1980. Day at the Races is wonderful. The Game is a classic. Night At the Opera is quirky, but still a good listen. But Hot Space is atrociously bad. Let me repeat that: atrociously bad. It sounds like somebody fooling around with a drum machine who didn't realize they were being recorded. It's a bad karaoke nightmare.Admittedly, yes, Under Pressure is a great song. But it couldn't possibly be more out of place unless it were included on a Megadeth CD. Really, it's that bad. Am I making myself clear? :)"
2,Wonderful,My mother brought the first book of the series with us as reading material on a 4 week holiday in Scotland. I imediatly fell in love with it and upon returning to Canada devoured the series. They are incredibly exciting and the series as a whole is a must read. I recommend them to anyone who wants a good plot at an easy writing level.
1,Buy something else,"The dvd is a documentory, alot of talking and very little music. I thought it was them in concert. Too much talking"
1,Not really a bargain--terrible sheets,"Dollar store quality. Lovely dark pattern, but it is printed on thin white flannel, not over-printed on blue yarn-dyed fabric, and the stitching on these fairly dark sheets is white."
1,Glue failing,"Good looking shoes, but...after just 1 month,the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends. The shoe still looks perfect, but I had to use shoe goo to fix it. Seems like for the price, and for as long as this style has been around it shouldn't so this?!"
1,[not good]!,"What happened? I thought the first two were classics but this was just plain [not good]. RoboCop's fight with the samurai toward the end was OK, but did not save this movie from being terrible. If you want something real entertaining then pick up Die Hard, all the James Bond films, both Terminator films and the first two RoboCop films. They are more worth your time and money than this."
2,"Love It, Love It, Love It","The produce does just what it states: connects your tivo to your network, allowing guide updates wirelessly AND the ability to connect to your computer and transfer shows. Transferring shows is the main reason that I purchased it, although it is an added benefit because I was connecting to a phone line for scheduling updates. It took me a while to get the tivo to be recognized on my computer as it was being blocked by the firewall & tivo's support site or representatives were not much help, but the forums were. Highly recommended & great savings on [...]!"
2,A Touching Book,"This story is so true and one of my favorites. Meet Francie, the daughter of Katie and Johnny Nolan, who don't have much future in store for their intelligent and bookworm daughter. You learn about Francie, the so honestly true story. It's amazing that it isn't your story. The slums of Brooklyn come to life in this touching story. If you did not enjoy this book you have no passion for life, or no feelings for those who do exsist but you push them out of your mind."
2,Needed Tightening in the Screenplay,"While I like ""Fort Apache,"" I feel that there is too much horseplay in the movie as well as too much Shirley Temple-John Agar. Joanne Dru is far superior in a similar type of role in the follow-up ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon."" The screenplay to ""Fort Apache"" could have been tightened up dropping about 10 minutes and giving it a more streamlined result. ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" is a superior film because of a better handled script. Having said that, ""Fort Apache"" is still very entertaining. Its strength is in its opposing characters played by Henry Fonda and John Wayne. It's easy to focus on Fonda's martinet of a commander, but Wayne is excellent in his somewhat secondary role. He's almost an observer on equal footing with the supporting players and that generosity pays off with a very likeable, heroic character. I don't like ""Fort Apache"" enough to add it to my collection, as I have ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" but it's still a film to watch and enjoy."
1,Bullsh#+!!,"Perhaps by the time you read this Amazon will be clearer in its TiVo description, but in case they aren't, you NEED to know that this is just the hardware for a monthly PAY service. I REALLY felt taken for a ride on this, as they referred to it as a ""service plan""-- well, I don't have a ""service plan"" on my oven, and it works just fine. It is completely misleading to call the fee they charge every month a ""service plan"".Tivo won't be getting a penny of mine. . ."
1,Easier way to handle the Mormons at the door.,"I have an even easier way to handle the Mormons at the door, and I'll give it to you for FREE. When they come to your door, say ""Thank you, but I'm not interested"" and then close the door. Save yourself 6 bucks and let people believe what they want. I do this every time some person comes peddling to my door. Be it a salesman or a religious representative of any religion."
1,Highly overrated,"It is extremely meandering and never seems to end. It's all about atmosphere and erotic cool and Prague, etc., but at some point a car chase would really liven things up. How about some more nipples? Throw a pie in Juliet Binoche's face? Anything! Just stop wandering around, muttering to yourself like a half-wit.Perhaps I don't get it, but I don't get syphillis either and I'm the better for it. Where's your witty rejoinder to that?!A real test of patience, this film."
2,Soon to be your kid's favorite,"As a Chicagoan, I am so proud to boast about Ralph's World. These songs are witty, catchy and have great messages. My one year old daughter just loves listening to them in the car. When Tra La La comes on, she starts singing ""la la la."" My husband cracks up at the song about the eighteen wheeler every time. The only track we don't like it is Harry's Haunted Halloween Circus, but it is easily skipped."
2,Excellent replacement,"You'd think for such a high-end, costly ""entry-level"" laptop, buying a replacement part would be affodable. This isn't the case with the apple ibooks. The cords which seem prone to damage and breaking down, are $80.00 to replace if you go to Apple. That's a lot of money for a cord that will in all probability break in around 8 months.The Macally is a great alternative - it's a lot cheaper and has been very, very durable. The one drawback is that it doesn't light up the side of your laptop (red when charging, green when charged). Other that than, it's great! Good purchase for me."
2,If you are being stalked you need this book,"Mike Proctor demonstrates that he understands the issue of stalking completely. This is the best resource I have found to facilitate effectively working with law enforcement and prosecutors and using the criminal justice system to protect victims from their stalkers. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about stopping their stalker or stalkers. Stand up and fight these bullys - stop living in fear, believing that you are powerless to stop them. You can do it!"
1,"Book in great condition, but took 20 days to get it","This book was brand new when I received it. However, it did not arrive for 20 days after I ordered it."
2,Good Introduction....,Well-made book. Informative with excellent photography. The overall layout is quite conducive to interrupted reading - easy to pick up and start anywhere.
2,From a fan since day 1,"This is probably the most original recording I have heard in the past year since their self-titled debut, which might I add should not be forgotten because in it is System of a Down's original hard rock sound. blah blah blah, don't want to bore you guys, this CD is for those of you who are tired of buying those rock cds that all sound alike, this one is a lot more than can be summarized in the genre of rock. blah blah blah go buy it, or pirate it, whatever your thing is. and get their first cd afterwards"
2,It will become a part of you...,"Sweet Dream Baby is an amazing novel, and its power grows as time passes. I read the novel when it first came out, and it's still with me. The music, the sight of a swimming hole, even a dusty road can make Travis and Delia appear for me again. What I wanted to know when I put the book down was, does Travis have a chance at a decent life? And what was up with Delia? More and more, I want to find out, because I can't let these characters go. I hope there will be a sequel."
1,truly awful.,crispin glover completely ruins this movie. had a pretty good yet uninspired plot....but still decent enough to stick with...UNTIL about half way through and you seriously cant take him anymore....this movie could of been a ton of fun but ended up truly sucking.
1,Came with a Leak,"Guess I knew we were gambling when we bought this, since about half the existing reviews said it arrived with a leak. Remind me to never to go Vegas, right? It arrived, we blew it up with the built-in pump, which worked like a charm. Seemed like it was pretty comfortable... then my son took it on a sleepover, and woke up the next morning flat on the floor. Returned it to Amazon as a defective item for a full refund. Thinking I like another reviewer's idea of just buying a regular twin-size mattress, since we would usually be using it at home anyway, then maybe get one of the pump-less airbeds for the occasional road trip, since those have better reliability stats than the ones with the built-in pump. Live and learn..."
2,great for kids and seniors,I bought these for myself because I have arthritis and it makes card playing much easier and more enjoyable. My elderly father also uses them. They're sturdy and stand by themselves.
2,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer,"I like my mug warmer. It keeps my coffee hot. Now, if I could remember to turn it off, all would be wonderful."
1,Do I have to give it 1-star?,"I've never written a review but my curiosity about what others thought of this book was a thousand times more compelling than the Edge of Danger. I've enjoyed Mr. Higgins' books in the past but can't for the life of me understand a) why he wrote this book, or b) why it was published! There is no plot, no character development, predictable action, no tension. It's like reading an Executive Summary of a book. Are you sure they didn't publish the outline by mistake?"
2,Excellent for my students,"I teach mentally handicapped adults at a local community college, and if you want durable puzzles that your students can use over and over again, I strongly recommend getting puzzles like this. It's durable and can get students to focus their attention. Worth getting."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!!,i ordered this item for support being that i have a rather large chest. the item had MUCH more coverage than the picture lets on and came in the size i ordered according to the tag but once i had it on i realised it was 3 sizes too SMALL. when i returned it to the sender the refunded only HALF my money. this item was ordered with one more bra like it and out of my $40 order i got just over $20 back. i plan on disputing this with amazon and the seller.
1,"This is NOT John Williams, the composer and conductor!","This is John Williams, the guitarist. There is no way anyone listening to this would ever confuse this with John Williams, the composer and conductor, unless all the other music someone listens to is Rock and other music to grow pimples by."
2,Ex-military man falls for live-in nanny!,"Another installment in the Texas Cattleman's Club series - Silhouette Desire #1547 (November 2003) - ""Entangled With A Texan"" by Sara Orwig. Book summary from back cover:Tied up in knots! How on earth had Texas Cattleman's Club member David Sorrenson been roped into protecting a tiny baby girl? The ex-military man knew everything about security and danger, not infants! Marissa Wilder was the perfect solution. This down-to-earth family gal knew all about children, and agreed to be a live-in nanny at his ranch. David yearned to show Marissa a steamy night or two, even though his high-risk lifestyle had taught him to avoid long-term attachments and his sexy houseguest deserved someone permanent. Living with Marissa was tangling up his emotions something awful, and if he didn't know better he'd swear he was falling for her...."
2,Real dazzler,Albert Lee has been delighting me since his days with Heads Hands and Feet. I have always been a rock fan except for Albert Lee. His music is so well done and just plain pleasant to listen to that it draws me right in. His guitar skills are as good as anyone in the buisness. His guitar is always there but never overpowering. This CD contains material I originally bought on record more years ago than I'd care to admit. It still sounds as fresh and clean as it did all those years ago. I would recommend this CD to anyone with an ear for dazzling guitar work with a country flavor. His choice of material os first rate and the recording quality of the CD is also first rate. Buy this thing and you'll like it.
1,"Understanding ""Switters""","In Tom Robbins ""Fierce Invalids Home From Warm CLimates"" the main character Switters is attempting to read this book and never gets though the first 5 pages. I now understand why."
1,Not even really ProTouch,"I ordered a ProTouch keyboard protector from amazon for a macbook pro. I received a cheap, no name brand clear rubber keyboard cover for a macbook white. it came in a bag that said ""Wireless Accessories"" on it. that's all it said. the same bag that the no name brand cell phone cases come in. certainly not a presentable package. I was displeased to say the least, and no company name was available for me to ship it back to, or exchange."
1,Fallen Leaves,"Although he may be as genius as he is, Walt Whitman is just random. His structure and development are atrocious, leaving us in a cloud of confusion. His lists, names, and metaphors can only be described as random thought. And don't even get me started on his comma use. That's how my little sister writes for crying out loud! I mean, don't you remember? You'd get lucky if you found an ""and"" in there somewhere. Granted, he did revolutionize poetry and writing as we know it. However, certain selections for his ever famous Song of Myself show that he can sure describe those bodily actions that he seems to love so much. I can cut him some slack, probably because he's a romantic writer, but his random stringing of words, phrases, and lists do his poetry injustice. Poor Jonathon Edwards would be turning in his grave..."
2,"Besides vanity reasons, there's no reason to buy another Apple adapter","I got the Macally power cord after the Apple one that came with my iBook finally broke down 2 years after purchase. I will agree that this model isn't as aesthetically pleasing as the Apple version, and I do miss having the orange and green indicator light to let me know that my computer is charging, but the difference between $30 and $80 is enough that I'm willing to give up the eye candy for the price. The Macally power adapter charges my computer just as well as the Apple version, it just doesn't look pretty while it does it. Also, it's a bit bulkier and takes up more space in my laptop bag. Still, the $50 I saved makes it worth the added weight. Unless you have serious reasons for buying the Apple power adapter (eg, vanity), I would go ahead and get the Macally version. Your pocketbook will thank you, and you can spend the extra money on other Apple extras."
1,Geh,"Blah blah, sexy girl, blah blah, fighting robots, blah blah, cliche action lines, blah blah, talking robots, blah blah blah."
1,Overhyped mediocre debut,"There is no artistry is this first endeavor. Some of the lyrics are painfully odd and Aiken's delivery lacks depth, texture, nuance, finesse, and diversity. Yes, he is a guy who can sing, but he is not an interesting singer. He is certainly not original, nor do I get a sense that there is any real emotion behind the delivery. I feel like I'm being sung at rather than sung to. I admit to never being a fan of glory noting brand of singing, and Aiken only solidifies that conviction.I didn't find him interesting on AI and he is even less so on this debut. Aiken has proclaimed that he is not an artist, just a guy from a reality show. So far, he's confirmed the limitations of his musical aspirations.As for his sales. Well, McDonalds sells alot of burgers... that doesn't make the burgers any better quality. Nothing's wrong with those who enjoy a fast food burger, please enjoy, but don't insist it's filet mignon."
1,"Awkward controls, below-par reliability","Like Korean cars, this Korean camcorder does what it says, but it's not something you'll be proud to own. The controls are awkward... even Sony's compact minidv camcorders have better buttons. The video quality is sub par, and my unit, which I received as a factory-sealed gift, broke after about 6 months, a first for all the Asian electronics I have owned. For a little bit more money, you can buy much better camcorders from Japanese manufacturers."
1,How Not to become a good Argentine Tango dancer,"This video is fine for ballroom dancers, but it has nothing to do with the authentic Argentine Tango. Even ballroom dancing has now a separate category for Argentine Tango. Unfortunately, this video is not that. That's why, I rate it at 1."
2,Big Brother,I don't think I can say anymore about this than hundreds of other readers have already mentioned. It's a classic and rightfully so. But will Big Brother eventually take over our lives? You be the judge.
2,Fun Toy For Traveling,"This is a really fun toy for kids when traveling. Both of my kids (10 & 13) had fun playing with it, and I recommended it to my parents who got one as well. It will keep kids amused for a good long time, and it makes them really think about a certain object. Good fun!"
1,Have not received my order yet,I have not received my order yet so I cannot review the book; however all the Kathy Reich books I have read so far have been enjoyable reads.
2,Just this..,The only disparaging thing I can say about this book is that it caused me to purchase a better dictionary.
1,Worse than I thought it could ever get,One of the worst collection of sounds ever slopped onto a disc. Utterly terrible.
1,WARNING - Does Not Help,"This is one of those books that copies all of the information from other books and tries to call it their own (an does not give all the information needed to do the few examples). If need information on bookbinding, the best I have found is Hand Bookbinding: A Manual Of Instruction by Aldren Watson (also available here)."
1,Problem with 2nd disc,"Like other reviewers, I had the same problem with the second disc. I sent it back not ONCE but TWICE, so in all I tried 3 copies of the movie, and the second disc still would not work on any copy. This movie is great, but DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION, unless you want a DVD that doesn't work. They really need to fix this problem."
2,Bradbury at his best,This was Bradbury's best book. He has an amazing ability to paint a scene without unnecessary description and create tension with characters you can truly identify with and live in their skin. He will be missed.
1,Bites,"I hated this book. William Faulkner has to be the poorest excuse for a writer that ever lived. I got so tired of his pages long sentences and parentheticals within parentheticals within sentences within parentheticals (I wish I were making this up). To make matters worse, sometimes his parentheticals were so long, I forgot what preceded it! And let's not forget his made-up words (uninsatiable? ever hear of a dictionary, Will? IT'S NOT IN THERE!) This book bites, HARD. And let's face it, if he were alive today, no way would anyone with a brain publish this garbage. At least not without some serious editing."
1,Faulty Power Cord,"I bought this plug as a substitute to replace the Apple one that blew out. Unfortunately, this plug seems to have problems. I noticed that it heats up really badly when plugged into some plug outlets and causes my laptop to heat up as well. Once, I also heard some noise coming from my iBook G4 that wasn't there before. This noise went away when I unplugged the power cord. What I'm most upset about though is that it seems to have shortened the battery life of my computer to about 50% now! I think I should have bought the Apple plug instead."
1,tivo,"I gave it a 1-star review because I couldn't get it to work. The Dish Network package where I live wouldn't allow me to connect with the TiVo service. Before ordering this dvr, always make sure it will work with your cable or sattelite provider."
1,I've never thought about the affects of a book quite so much,"Personally, I enjoy novels in which I can relax. 1984 let me do anything but that. Not only is the book overly detailed, but quite borring. Unless it's assigned, I wouldn't suggest it."
1,Too small and stained,"I ordered this for my average sized 8 year old. I purchased the medium (size 8-10) and it is way too small. It's too short, tight around the shoulders, the boot covers don't cover her foot and the mask won't go around her head (not even close and again she's 50%ile in both height & weight for her age). This size would be better for a 5 year old! And if that isn't bad enough, the cape has a dark (non-removable) stain on it! I'm hoping I can return it w/o paying for shipping considering this item is damaged."
1,I've been had!,"This is the only thing my son wanted for Christmas. I was hesitant because I thought it was a bit pricy. But I didn't want to disappoint my son so I bought it. True, the look on his face was worth the money the toy was not. It took a really long time to put the thing together and it has to lean up against a wall to stand. When he uses any of the supposedly ""cool"" features another piece falls off. My son has a long attention span and can play with a toy for a half an hour before moving on to something else. This toy frustrates him after just a few minutes."
2,worked perfectly!,"After my son broke the mirror on our sporttrac by clipping another mirror on a narrow street, I ordered this replacement part for a fraction of what the dealer quoted me for fixing the mirror. Found a video on youtube on how to remove the door panel and within about 10-15 minutes I had the new mirror installed and working perfectly."
2,Heavy duty pitcher,Standard high quality piece of equipment.Cleans up easily.Works perfectly for steaming and frothing milk.Definitely would purchase again.
1,ARGGGGGG!!!!!!!,This is generic half less than ok - half horrible - completely unforgetable - generic drudge - please get back with Survivor and make something someone in America would like? or are you happy playing to tiny crowds in Europe - comeon....lets get back together for some good music - not this sore missing any punch run of the mill yuk - Survivor could have rocked the sh.. out of the Real One - which is now being endless played on radio...
2,Nice clear illustrations,"This is a handy little reference. It's about the size of a credit card, but twice as thick. Suitable for a wallet or pocket.There are six cards, double-sided, and some two knots, for a total of 15 knots. The cards are fastened together, so there's no chance you'll lose one of them.I'm just getting started learning knots, and I have tried a few of these. So far this has been a good help. This will be handy to have around. With practice, I'll have a few of these committed to memory."
2,Is this remastered version?,"What a beautiful picture than I thought before buying this. No computer image, no sfx, natural good old film. I love this film."
2,Excellent,"I bought this because I am a bit introverted and the idea of sitting in a room with other couples was causing me anxiety. But, my midwife really wanted me to get the wealth of knowledge that a child birth class provides. I took a chance and found this DVD on amazon. I truly lucked out, this dvd is awesome! The teacher is qualified and just funny. She keeps you interested and gives the info in easy to remember ways. I like that there are five couples in the class, so you still get the worries and questions that other new parents could only provide. The interaction is great and you can stop and start the dvd at you convenience. I will say that it held my interest so much that I watched the entire first dvd without stopping! If going to a an actual class is not for you for whatever reason, then I would highly recommend this to you! You will not regret it and will come out more knowledgeable and feeling confident about your upcoming birth. Good Luck!!!"
1,A Piece of Trash,"This is the worst Bardem-Perez movie that I have seen. If the director De la Iglesia has some Tarantino influence, he went too far. It also depicts Mexicans as cult members and grotesque.It places people in the Caribbean speaking with a Castillian accent. A real piece of trash and mentally disturbing."
2,R. Kelly's BEST ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best and my favorite R. Kelly's album. Nuff said.
2,another winner by mustang,"It may be a five,but I won't actually get another ride in this year. The seat looks great, shipped fast and was easy to install. It certainly is heavier than the stock seat and wider with more back support."
1,Good intentions... Horrible execution.,"Piper Perabo is a great new face in Hollywood and I look forward to seeing what she does next. That said, I believe the director and editor (more on that later) should be taken to a public place and caned with a bamboo pole.What starts as a cute girl-coming-of-age-in-the-big-city movie begins to fall apart the moment the girl who's too shy to sing in front of anyone starts working in a bar that requires her to dance on the bar while getting buckets of water dumped on her. ""Oh I'm too shy to sing one of my songs in front of my new date, but I'll strip for him!"" What???There is a spasmatic sequence with a phone call, a trip to a club, a family reunion and a performance that had to have been spliced together by an MTV editor that drank way too much Mountain Dew while eating pixie sticks. One character even repays a debt that was cut out so she couldn't have even known that she owed it!Hopefully Piper will have better luck with ""Slap Her, She's French"" this year."
2,Black Converse Sneakers,"I got the shoes really quickly. They were very well priced. They arrived pretty quickly in the mail, although I wish they had arrived slightly quicker."
1,Bad movie? You're soaking in it,"Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of. Avoid like the plague."
2,Good replacement,"Great product is exactly what it says. Good replacement for my mirror which was broken. It is slightly different on the inside but the exterior, after installation, is unnoticeable."
2,"quarter through, and totally imressed","I have yet to complete this book, but its great so far. Entertaining, and educational. hard to mix the two and keep my interests. I hope this helps sway you to purchase. HAPPY SHOPPING"
1,not good,"Cannot say that I enjoyed reading this book, because I did not approve of a lot of the things the author included. However, I did find some of the main points interesting to create a story. But definitely not the type of good book to read, nor would I recommend it."
2,Buying another one!,"I bought the original 4 years ago, have loved it, and am buying the remanufactured one for our vacation home. I expect it (after reading all the other reviews) to perform exactly like my original, which is still performing beautifully. Looks great on the kitchen counter, too--very classy."
2,Fantastic product that is pdenticle to original charger,The product works perfectly and I am extremely pleased with it. I can tell no difference between this charger and the original charger that came with my camera. Shipping was fast and professional.
2,Greatest book ever written,"Unbelievably complex book; possibly the last book you ever have to read & understand. Take 3 years to work on this masterpiece. A good grasp of Celtic and British history essential to its full appreciation. The story of creation, the theory of cultural evolution of civilization, the history & mythology of the Celtic people...what more could you possibly want?"
1,"Yes, this is a lame=weird movie","1. one may try to impress others by talking up this artsy fartsy movie, but the intellectually honest will realize that this movie is just... lame.2. the acting is stilted and so unrealistic and of course--> the storyline is just bizarre. but of course, the self-indulgent and narcissistic love unusual storylines so as to fool the general public.3. at the end of the day, dismiss the high brow critics and realize this movie for what it is--> an odd / bizarre movie with surprisingly lame acting."
2,Good Product,I was a little disappointed the item was lost in the mail but as soon as I contacted the company they sent a replacement & I received it in less then 48hrs
1,Flawed CDs,"I have ordered this set and then returned it and had a replacement set sent. Both sets have had one CD that has music missing in bits and pieces. I assume that all sets have been cut from the same master set, since both sets I have received are flawed."
1,word salad as verbal Rorschach test,"let the high preists of deconstructionist post modernism interpret it for you. bow down before the wisdom of frustrated ineffectual professors of English, the preistly class who will interpret this message from the gods for you, (and actually get pay and respect for it). lets get real. this is a book by a sciziphrenic for the pompous and pedantic. a few puns aside dont waste your life trying to interpret this nonsense, just because you have an ego. (even Nobel laureates fell for it--hence the quark, but FASHIONABLE NONSENSE is the delayed reaction)the real dope: read: WHAT ART IS. MADNESS AND MODERNITY. and THE FOUNTAINHEAD. for some insight into why nonsense like this continues to propagate."
1,Very Thin and leaks,Tried pampers for the first time and it was size 5. It's very Thin and most of the time it leaks from the side when she poops.
1,Clay please dont become so commercial!,"Let me start by saying that Clay should have won first place on American Idol, He was a thousand times better than everyone else and has a voice that far surpasses his peers.That said, this was a lousy effort on a first release, Clay became what Simon wanted all along..COMMERCIAL. He did not remain true to himself and that to me is a very sad thing, I am extremely disappointed!"
2,Everything as advertised.,"I saw this movie in my German class, and I thought it was a cool enough movie to buy and own. The DVD did not disappoint : )"
1,ESD killed my unit,I went to turn the volume down and a static discharge from my fingers went right through the volume control knob and literally smoked it. Seems to me you shouldn't have to worry about electrostatic discharge ruining your equipment when turning a knob on the front of the unit! Like maybe using plastic instead of metal knobs?
2,Great deal. Great diaper.,Pampers are great for keeping Your baby dry and happy! Also the best price I have found.
2,pretty good,"I like this product, but I wouldn't use it daily. I learned this the hard way. It is stronger then you think!!!!!"
2,tiny stones; good reaction,"The stones are so small you can hardly see them. But my wife loved it, and it looks good on her. She likes her jewelry more subtle than gaudy."
2,helps children feel less afraid,"My daughter who is a huge Elmo fan enjoyed this DVD. She was very sympathetic when Elmo was afraid, but now points out every fire truck, tells me why the firefighters wear their boots, hat and jacket, and can stop, duck and go."
1,Special,I found this movie slow paced. The plot failed to catch and keep my attention. I am glad I did not buy this title.
2,Smallville DVD 9th season,"I have been watching the Smallville series since season one! The ninth season was not packaged as nice as some of the previous seasons, but the new DVDs are nice and clear to watch. I know there is a season ten, but I also can feel the series is coming to an end. It was nice while it lasted. Ms Mack has been with the series from the start. I loved the part where she could heal people with her touch. She seems like a very nice girl - I wonder what she is actually like?"
2,Overall fine!,"I bought this to replace and older USB wireless adapter which I broke. This one works fine with my series 2 Tivo. Hooked up easily, no problems. Better quality reception!"
2,Great American,This autobiography covers a lot of Ben Franklin's work/life prior to the first Continental Congress. This was a great American and I enjoyed going back in time to learn how this self made man prospered.
2,"Love It, but...","This amp plays crisp and clear, but i was a little disappointed in the power. I should have known better 50wpc. Still sounds great. I'll just turn it up a litle higher."
1,Luvs is better!,"My daughter bought these diapers for her son, my grandson, thinking that they would be better than other diapers because of the Pampers name brand. We BOTH regret this purchase! These diapers definitely do not last all night. I give them no more than 3 hours! Needless to say, we will be sticking to Luvs diapers. Not only are they more affordable, but they are RELIABLE!"
2,Another Hot One!!!,The new SWEATSUIT album is hot. My favorite song is Tired featuring Avery Storm. I can really relate to this song. Sometime you get too feed up and you can't take it anymore. That's when its time to go. My man Nelly really did it this time. I have to give him mad props. I LOVE this man. I cannot wait for more to come. Keep up the good work Nelly.
1,"Do robots yawn? Probably , if they watch this.","Oh woe, here we go with xenophobia. Evil, satantic Japanese baddies seek to take over Robocop's home city with the help of some rather melodramatic and frankly tedious robotic ninjas.The first Robocop was an excellent and moving film. By now the series has lost all its magic and vitality and is no more than people fighting. Somebody seems to have had the idea of making this one for younger viewers, so it's all very tame compared to its predecessors and relies heavily on flashbacks to the first (and superior) film.Uninspiring, dull and overblown. Don't bother with this film. You'll only encourage them to make a Part 4 and drag the character of Robocop down to even greater depths."
2,Mr. Puntels Class,"The Book a Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court was a good Novel. The Book had a good story and premise. Based in Kentucky it talked a lot about the Aimish and farm life. The only thing that was remotely bad about the book was some unrealistic events. Overal it was a good book. The book looked and was boring at first but as the plot and storyline started to develop it got a lot better. If any one was wondering about or having doubts of the Roman Catholic faith, I definitely recommend it."
2,Reflections from Largely Ignored Golfing Foundation,"Little publicity gained from club pro, other than the infamous club pro's students who do good. These pros (male and female now) are true backbone of the sport, feeding the sport. In this case, Claude Harmon Jr. reflects on his father, famous club pro and player who wore the coveted Green Jacket.One clearly learns of life lessons Butch carried to his life and students from his father. Salient to his father's remarkable and here documented career is association with Henry Ford and Ben Hogan.There are many gleanings to take from this for golf, for life. Worth read which is personal and honest and passionate, reflecting the author."
1,Ludicrous and silly,"I remember getting this book so faintly that that says alot about my opinion of it. Basically, while I will entertain lots of odd ideas and theories, this book was basically silly."
1,Worthless Coffee Pot,"I bought this product to have a small coffee pot in the office. However, when brewing, this pot somehow always gets significant amounts of coffee grounds into the pot, regardless of how the filter is arranged. Total waste of money, I'll be throwing this away and buying another."
1,Get a grip,"The brush is stiff, I guess you get used to it. It has a long handle, compared to a hair bush? The handle is smooth and you cannot grip it when you are in the shower. It is anything but ergonomic. I guess you take a dry bath. Do not buy this brush unless you are needing to bristle off some very caked on dry skin or rust and can use a grinder to make the handle gripable. What a waste of good money."
1,Stick with the on-line docs,Does little more then scratch the surface in most areas.Would only be of any use for the novice.Ken
1,Presley's Worst Film,"""Spinout"" (1966) represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema - a bad sitcom without the laugh track. The only redeeming features are a few memorable songs, such as ""I'll Be Back"" and ""Stop, Look and Listen."" Buy the soundtrack and skip the movie."
2,leaves of grass,"everything was WONDERFUL. I did, however, receive it a day late, which was problematic for my class. BUT nonetheless, I was very happy."
1,Terrible,"I read it halfway hoping that a plot line would develop, it never did. Too much incest and I hated how everyone had the same name. I love thought provoking books that you have to work at but this is just plain silly. This book is for the phony intellectuals who want to say they read it and feel cultured. This book is just awful, there are way too many good books to waste your time on this one."
2,"With the length of this book, you have no excuse not to read it","This is a very short book.This is a very good book.Schaeffer's insight put a whole new perspective on things that I had never before considered. Namely: the world has the right to judge Christians based on whether or not they love. You will have to read the book to understand everything Schaeffer uses to reach that conclusion, but I doubt you will be able to argue once you do. Schaeffer explains how love is the not just an element which distinguishes Christians from nonChristians. You will be challenged to re-visit your own heart and determine the truth of John's words ""If a man does not love his brother, the Truth [Christ] is not in him.""You can read this book in an hour or two, but its thoughts will travel with you for weeks and its impact for the rest of your life."
2,Dark of the Moon DVD,Great value for money. I purchased this DVD for my son as he loves Transformers. Received the DVD before the estimated date and before it was due to be released in Australia.We were only interested in the movie(extras etc not a big deal for my son) so it was a very good buy.Quality of movie was good too.
1,Pampers June shipment -Product quality was poor,The june 2011 shipment of the pampers cruisers diapers was way below par. The diapers were too thin and leaking all the time.I'm on auto-shipment
1,Does not stick,"Well its winter here in New England, I want to know the temperature outdoors... and this suction cup will not stick to windows, sliding doors, nada. Within a few minutes its off and laying on the ground. Waste of money."
2,Of mice and men,"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck was written about a young man who had mental problems and struggled through life. The scene of the book was in the country, were Lennie, the main charecter, looked for jobs with his friend George to make money and fufil there dreams. George would look after Lennie and keep him out of trouble. People weren't to social with lennie because of his mental disorder, they thought he was stupid, and caused troubles. It was a struggle for Lennie to get by and stay out of trouble, and ended up in a tragic ending. I recomend this book to any one who likes to read. This book made me want to give any one a chance and dont judge a book by its cover."
2,Accessible Early American Setting,"I remember seeing this book title in the YA section of the library when I was young, though I didn't read it at that time. I now teach Early American Literature, and I really appreciate these books that give my students a sense of place. We've been using Kathleen Kent's The Heretic's Daughter, but The Witch of Blackbird Pond tells just about the same story with more accessible content. It's certainly just as appropriate for adults as for young people.The story moves at a quick pace and gives a realistic sense of setting. It covers themes from the time period such as religious intolerance, hypocrisy, the slave debate, fear of outsiders.I highly recommend this reading for anyone interested in late 1600s Early America. Read it on your way to visit historic Salem, Mass."
2,THE MAGIC ORANGE TREE,Is a really good book!!! Easy for kids to learn. I will recommend this book to other family. I PERSONALLY ENJOY READ TO MY LITTLE ONE.
2,It is a Christmas gift.,The shoe tree is a gift. All I know is that it came in a box with a picture of a shoe tree on it.
1,The Alchemist,Sure this is an interesting book. Unfortunately the copy we received was written in spanish!
1,Horrible Service,Do not purchase from this seller. Horrible service. It took them over a month to ship me my filter and didn't even compensate me with free shipping. When I asked what the hold up was they told me they left me a voice message (which they didn't) and that my order would be reshipped due to shipping failure. This was their fault and I didn't even receive an apology. Very disappointed and will never purchase from them again.
2,Surprising Excellence!,"""Crazy in Alabama"" is set in the early 1960's and combines several plots expertly: the Civil Rights Movement, spousal abuse, and parentless children. Antonio Banderas directs brilliantly. Melanie Griffith is a vision of loveliness and her performance is worth seeing all by itself! The bottom line is, no matter what the consequences, we must do the right thing."
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!,"Judd Apatow has reached an absolutely new level of... sucking!!! Even Adam Sandler, one of my favorite actors of all times, sucked too, big time!!! There are funny movies, there are not so funny ones, there are stupid and ridiculous flix and... there's Funny People! Its name should be changed to ... what's the word for utterly unfunny? Almost 100% of jewish actors and they couldn't pull it off? That's odd!?"
1,Why can't it be rated ZERO stars?,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT--I took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended. Nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke. The software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other SOUND BLASTER products, which is very dumb."
1,My husband even complains about these!!,"These diapers are junk! I recently tried some Pampers again and they were terrible! The tabs would rip off half the time and this would really make my husband disgruntled! I told him Pampers are supposed to be the ""best"" in the diaper area! He told me to stick with the Huggies! Boys and girls, quality, price, Huggies are the way to go in our household! I would not recommend these diapers for anyone, unless you like throwing unused daipers into the garbage can!"
2,Not bad at all...,"I was not really sure how this movie was going to play, but it is a thriller and it did keep me on the edge of my seat --- I would probably even watch it a second time --- that's saying a lot for me.BUT, do yourself a favor and buy it used on amazon marketplace or rent it..."
1,To many comparisons for a real story,"You can't tell is a great story when the story is real, here the writer tells us a real story and he writes things to compare the reality of that story with other stories, if you are writing a real story you don't have to compare it with anything, just tell the story and that's it.In the other hand your will read many times that it was a sunny day, then a rainy day, the a storm day, you just get tired of reading the same in all the chapters.In the main story you will learn that when happened a human tragedy, this tragedy is because were made several errors, not just one, and that was what happened to this crew.For ME, the last chapter is the epilogue and the epilogue doesn't have to be written."
2,I'm soooooooo impressed,"A friend of mine has Natalise's first album and I thought it was pretty good. But I was not prepared when I bought her new album. OMG this album is SO AMAZING! It is much better than my wildest expectations! We don't have any big record stores in my little town, so I had to order it and it and I forgot about it. Then when it came I was like, ""okay, let's see what it sounds like becaue the clips on her website where pretty good"". But EVERY song on this album is AMAZING! I love the slow songs, and she printed all the lyrics. The fast dance songs sound REALLY good in the car with the volume cranked all the way up! This is just all-around an absolutely stellar album. Natalise did an incredible job on it. I would not be suprised to see her win a Grammy one day!"
2,Love this!,I'm training my waist to lose inches. I used to always buy fajas which are very uncomfortable and takes alot of getting used to. I wear them most of the day and throughout the night. This one is more comfortable (as something squeezing u can be) and looks good under certain clothes. I like that the inside is a rubbery material that helps u sweat. It speeds up the weight loss process. I plan to buy the next size down soon because my waist has already shrank! I probably will buy the one with the straps next time because the strapless does kinda push ur back fat up and with certain clothes you can see it. All in all it's a great product and the most comfortable cincher I've ever bought.
2,Great story !,"The performance of all actors, especially Gerard Depardieu is top-notch. The story has a sad ending, but thought provoking. The excitement, energy and the fierce determination of Jean de Florette is inspiring. This city dweller is so determined to succeed as a farmer that he will give up under no circumstance. Beware that the French spoken in this movie is not the Parisian French, the Provence accent makes it very hard to understand, in case you are a student of French. (There are French subtitles too, besides English, so that helps a lot)."
2,Great bridging between fact and fiction,I was lucky to get this book as a free kindle edition. I tore through it and have ordered the second book. It is extremely well written with amazing detail.
2,awsume,i got this just it time to winterize our camper its better than draining all the water and replacing with anti freeze.. used it to blow out all water then just poured a little down the drains.. good price and shipping was fast..
2,Transformers,"This movie is a simply an action movie. It has the explosions, the cars, and the drama of an action movie and not much else. But then again, how much more do you need for a entertaining movie? With the level of graphics, a blu-ray is especially nice."
2,A quick read....,.......with basic factual info. A must have if you were recently diagnosed with partial seizures.
2,I want to be Shirley Manson!,This group has become my favorite. The music just rocks and Shirley and the boys are just fantastic. I love every song on this album and that is a rarity for me. I don't always agree with what Shirley has said off the stage but their music is great.
2,Don't let F.M. Radio Fool You!,"To begin with, I LOVE this cd; however, when I purchased 'Toxicity' I was expecting all of the tunes to have the harmonies present in Chop Suey! and (the song) Toxicicity. That was not the case. Not all of these tracks are quite as catchy (at first) as the songs getting radio play.With that said, this is an incredible cd! It'll definitely be on your list of cd's that make you drive about 80 miles/hour on the highway without even noticing. This cd has some heavy material on it, great for unwinding after a long day. There's some serious intensity on this disc that I can't describe in words. I picked up the disc after hearing Chop Suey! and Toxicicty and it's been in heavy rotation in the car ever since.PLUS - You get the bonus DVD with the Toxicity Video and 3 live tracks (Prison, Chop Suey!, & Bounce).If you're looking for somthing heavy, pick this up. But just know that it's not all ""Chop Suey!"" and ""Aerials""."
1,Ugh.,"I read this book for AP English and had to do a blue-book assignment of it. The word ""ugh"" summarizes my experience.This book was written in the 19th century, and that's where it belongs. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book, but reading through ""dost thou"" after ""dost thou"" isn't any fun.However, I highly recommend reading Richard Armour's take on SL in his book ""The Classics Reclassified""."
1,Unfair....,"The product works fine, however I was not told that you have to have TIVO service for it to work. I did not purchase it for the TIVO system, but to use it solely as a DVR hooked to my computer. Consequently I had to purchase the yearly service of $129.00 just to be able to use it for my purpose which I feel is unfair. I did not choose to send it back due to the shipping costs of returning it and also that they allow you to use it for two weeks without purchasing the service. I didn't hook it up right away due to being on vacation when it arrived. I was too close to being over the return point as well. I feel it was unfair to advertise this product without foreclosing the fact that to use it simpley as a DVR you still need to purchase the high cost of TIVO."
2,realistic,"I found this book very realistic. As someone who suffers from mild mental illness, it made alot of situations real to me. I enjoy the NYC mentions as I have recently visited New York. I could visualize the book well."
1,Needs more to it.,"I like to read erotic fiction from time to time. But if it doesn't have substance, it's nothing more than another trashy pornography novel. ""Eden"" was better than Anne's "" Beauty"" novels, but was definitely not for readers who want the zest they received from "" Interview with the Vampire""."
1,Nothing new here.,"I have been in an insatiable mood lately for new progressive rock music buying CDs on a daily basis. I have uncovered some superb new bands such as Riverside, Abigail's Ghost, Frost, Phideaux with the first two named bands being absolutely exceptional. I was encouraged by other reviews to try IQ and this album particularly as being an exceptional and representative example. I think what one reviewer said sums it all up. IQ have managed to be what they are because they simple outlasted everyone else. I was sorely disappointed with this album for its total lack of anything original and new. Musically its fine progressive rock but it is not original. Yes it is Genesis, come Marillion etc. but one thing it is not is anything like Seconds Out. Overall I found the album flat and uninspiring...sorry."
1,TERRIBLE! Leaks!,This is the worst nighttime diaper we have used. They leak 100% of the time leaving our baby drenched in her own urine! Awful. :( I highly recommend Huggies Overnites-zero problem with leaks and a great fit.We will not attempt to use these again.
1,Complete reference... yes,"Well although i found the book to be extremely informative and I learned a great deal from it, I was very disapointed that I could not get a lot of the examples to work for me. I am not talking about the images but the actual pages did not come up the way the way the book depicts them if you type them in exactly the way it is printed. I had to tweek them a bit to make them work correctly. I fell that I am going to have to go elsewhere to find the right type of book for me. Other than that the book did have a lot of information to give and will keep it as a reference as the book's title plainly details."
2,Fitting beginnng of an epic,"""Mad Max,"" the first film in a much-imitated but never equalled ""action"" tragedy/trilogy, perfectly sets up the following two movies. Together, they form an epic of one man's losses of all he loves, his ruthless revenge, and his eventual redemption, beginning in ""The Road Warrior,"" when he grudgingly assists a commune whose members repay him with treachery. Despite that, his metamorphosis comes to fruition in ""Thunderdome,"" in which Max regains his humanity to the fullest degree.Side made several in Australia before this one, and the one to see is ""Tim,"" in which Mel gives an incredible performance that's about as opposite of an apocalyptic anti-hero as anyone could get. This man has amazing talents, to the ""Max."""
1,Just horrible,"I really can't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record. First off, I bought it without hearing anything by them before, but it had been highly recomended to people who like Tool and Mars Volta by Amazon!! They couln't have been any more wrong. So, why did i personally find this so painfull?Well, the whole thing in general is quite painfull. First off, the musicians. The whole band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons, but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock! But why the hell, being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan, was I recomended this? It's bland, it's week, and the dubby bass, boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually, forget it. The whole package. It is just lame."
1,Offensive,"This is one of the most offensive and anti-gay movies I have ever seen. Don't let the title or the box fool you. Every character in this movie is oozing with homophobic sentiment. I was shocked that such a film could come out of France. If you're a homophobe and want to sit and watch a bunch of hateful people sit around and attack and harass (verbally and physically) a man who pretends to be gay to save his job, then rent this and snack on a can of worms.HIDEOUS!"
1,"Leaks, doesn't absorb odors either. Go with Swaddlers!","Going from Swaddlers to these was a HUGE mistake. The name ""baby dry"" should be a joke, because the diaper gets damp very fast, and ALWAYS smells like pee. It's not my baby either, I have to change out the diaper about twice more than normal and most of the diapers are barely heavy. Seems like such a waste... should've bought the smaller amount to test first. It's odd how the same brand could have one type vastly superior to the other. Again, go with Swaddlers, we had ZERO issues with them. ""Baby dry"" is a lie."
2,Where Loyalties Lie Review,"I could not put this book down. I almost ended up in divorce court because I spent all my time reading the book and not paying attention to my husband. When you think you knew who it could be, it wasn't that person until the end. This is an excellent book and take it from someone who hates reading, you will not be able to put it down. You may want to take a couple of days off work to read it."
1,"Not fun, not comfortable!","This product looked fun but in reality was very uncomfortable and it vibes only at the middle! It's also very large (long) and didn't fit very well! Anyway, in summary, a neat idea, but not a staple or even fun for a one time use!"
1,Dreary and ponderous text makes for a dull read,"This book was originally published in 1975 and boy does it feel its age. The writing is dull, flat and mindlessly repetitive. Reading it feels like a flat-footed ""Dick and Jane"" story with corns and bunions to boot. I probably should cut this book some slack because the author was probably trying to follow some educational theory of the time where children learn best to read if the text is ""X"". All I can say is ""Humph!"" Reading this little gem aloud for the first time to my little four-year-old, I had to heavily revise the text on the fly to make it even halfway listenable. The two stars comes from the drawing of birds. My little guy loves birds and loved looking at the pictures. He recognized some of the birds from our backyard. I've seen better birding books for the little ones."
2,Fantastic fim. But they forgot something!,"The film is great in every way. Truly a prison ""film noir"" classic. But everytime I watch it, I always, wonder ""Six guys in a cell and no toilet."" Must have been quite a problem!"
1,blagh,"I was hoping to have a condensed, to-the-point, informative guide on giving birth. I had missed my window of opportunity to be in a class and decided I preferred to be able to watch a video from home anyway. I feel that a lot of time is wasted in this video with theatrics and cheesy humor. I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it only to realize she was still desperately trying for laughs 5 minutes in to one point.I am probably going to purchase another video simply for the fact that her style irks me!"
2,"Don't be fooled by these books,","just because the recipe says to use pre-made ingredients doesn't mean you can't take the extra time to make as many of them from scratch that you can, like shredding your own cheese, cutting up a onion, or making your own mashed potatoes, etc. I sub as many fresh ingredients as I can for the pre-packaged and I still have a good meal made in no time. That may defeat the purpose of the cookbook, BUT, the recipes are what stand out, and any can me made with fresh or pre-packaged items.They are good, everyday family meals. The photos and lay out are outstanding, and the books are well priced for the quality we get from them. Worth the money."
2,Nice.,"This book surprised me. For being one of Gardner's first books, its a great one. He tosses around tons of different concepts and ideas with ease. He paints a vivid picture of of a universe in which ""The Technocracy"" regulates lifeform's behavior by eliminating all of the non-sentients. This in it's self makes for some pretty interesting rules. In this story, the main characters must not only deal with these rules, but also bend them. And the way that happens mixes a recipe that isn't your typical sci-fi fare.Very interesting stuff."
2,its great,"was helpful, it comes down all the nerves that exist before having the baby, enjoyed, did not get bored, its interesting and you feel like your part of the class. thanks"
2,A must-have for everyone interested in the Stalingrad Battle,"Recently I ordered 'Stopped at Stalingrad' from amazon.com. It was well worth the puchase, as the book is both a profoundly researched study and an interesting read. It's a scholarly work which, undoubtedly, will become a classic in its field.DÃ©nes BernÃ¡d, Aviation Historian and Author"
2,its a great pmp,it is one of the the best pmp's around . a great LCD and really good looks wit a 30GB capacity . well the price is a bit on the expensive side ........when compared to the archos AV420 which is at 306$ wit the capability of video recording facility . . . . .well i bought a creative and i dont regret it at all . . . . . excpt they could have put in the recording facility .it will be the best one around .
2,Adam Sandler Lost It...,"Well, when you hear of an Adam Sandler movie, a natural reaction is that you think that the movie is a hilarious comedy, but in this case, that's not entirely true. Don't get me wrong, the movie is FUNNY, persay, but I don't think I would catagorize it as a true comedy.If you're looking for an Adam Sandler type comedy, I'd rather recommend There's Something About Mary, which is a comedy with Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz, than this movie.But don't get me wrong, this is a good MOVIE, but not a good comedy. Rob Schnieder's role is just plain dumb, but Drew Barrymore is what truly makes the movie worthy of watching. She did an excellent job. You have to be a die-hard Adam Sandler fan for you to appreciate his performance in this movie. If you are watching this movie for Adam Sandler, then this is a pure waste of your time, but if you're watching this movie for Drew Barrymore, it's well worth it!"
1,Not recommanded,"After reading the other review I baught this puzzle for my son. I have had this puzzle for about a week now, and prob. going to have to toss it. As if with the tightness mentioned in the other review isnt already frustrationg enough, The puzzle pieces are made with layerd wood and taking the puzzle apart made the peices crack&chip and now have little wood peices all over the floor, and some pictures started to peel off. With all this going on I dont think it is save now with the sharp corners and most likely splinters coming soon and if your child is still randomly putting stuff in his mouth still, then he might choke or cut himself. Short to say dont buy, waste of money and time."
2,2008 is 1984,"""It's a beautiful thing the destruction of words"" This appelation coming out of the mouth of a character Syme seems strange for any author to intone, tantamount to writer's heresy. In a way, this whole book was about heresy, 'thoughtcrime' towards the regime which ruled Airstrip One. This book will be able to teach a lot about politics in the modern day. The only place where it really strays is at Orwell's atheistic uterances. Otherwise a great read."
2,Best metal album I own!!,"There is one thing wrong with this album and that is it made me like their s/t effort less. Although there is no 'Sugar' on this album it is pure quality from start to finish. The only song i don't love is Jet Pilot because I think its a bit too heavy in all the wrong ways but its still a good track. Best songs for me were Chop Suey, Forest and ATWA.I reckon Serj is the main reason that SOAD are a brilliant band rather than just a good band but every member pulls their weight. In short a modern day classic."
2,Zizzle iZ (Green),I bought a Zizzle iZ for [...] at Target. I thought it would be so cool and it is but there is one thing that I don't like about it. iZ talks when you play your music. He's makes comments on it. I think you should just buy one of these instead of spending hundreds of dollars on normal speakers.
1,Uncomfortable!,"It was really easy to put the Squeem on, but once it was on I couldn't wait to get it off!! It wasn't too tight or anything. The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip/mid back area and pinched my skin! It was so painful! No matter how I positioned it, it would bunch up! Really disappointed since it was a waste of $50.."
2,Great for TTC ladies!,"This stuff really helps improve your CM if you need a little help in that area. I'm on Clomid which unfortunately dries you out and I had heard of EPO on a forum I frequent. I took one pill with my mother meds after dinner and could already see an improvement by that night. The next day my CM was creamy, and without the EPO I would have been dry or sticky at best. By the third day I was borderline wet/creamy. I'm only on CD6 now and didn't ovulate until CD20 last cycle so I imagine by the time I need fertile CM it won't be an issue."
2,The ultimate for women,"My wife has several workout books but as she states, ""not one matches Arnold's"". This book not only covers subjects like what to eat, it also goes into great detail on what workouts work what muscles. Great book!"
2,There's no glitches!,"I don't get what everybdy is talking about. I haven't had any glitches and I'm in Troll cCountry. This game has great graphics and sound. Well, sure, it's hard. But that's the point. You wouldn't want to by a thirty dollar game that lasted two hours. That would [bad]!"
2,Cheesy deliciousness for VEGANS!!,"I love KAL yeast flakes add this to your favorite vegetable dish, favorite snack like organic popcorn or whatever your cheesy heart desires. Yeast flakes is rich, nutritious and delicious. You must have this on you at all times it is great, you're a sprinkle away from deliciousness just click and add to your cart!! You can thank me later :)"
1,I Was SOOOOOOOOOOOO Disappointed!!,"I love Clay Aiken to death, but I was really disappointed with this CD... I really feel that it is too commercial. I love his voice and he ""curled my toes"" when I saw American Idol. He and Ruben were my picks. I was sad when Clay didn't win, and I liked the ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" CD single, but I didn't like this. I won't pre-order any more... I'll wait to hear clips."
1,Hey Bob Hoskins...what do you think of Super Mario Bros.?,"The following is excerpted from an actual interview with Bob Hoskins, star of Super Mario Bros.:Guardian: ""So, what's the worst job you've done?""Hoskins: ""Super Mario Bros.""Guardian: ""What has been your biggest disappointment?""Hoskins: ""Super Mario Bros.""Guardian: ""If you could edit your past, what would you change?""Hoskins: ""I wouldn't do Super Mario Bros.""Don't mince words, Bob...how did you REALLY feel about Super Mario Bros.?"
2,New better design + fast shipment from Amazon,"I ordered this new improved Baby Dry pampers and have to say: they are really improved! They got flexy wings almost like Cruisers, which we used before and the design is very similar to Cruisers now. But the price of Baby Dry is much better, and you get more pampers in the box (180 instead of 160 like in Cruisers). The shipment was fast (about 3 days)."
1,mine jams too,"It was great at first, but after a few weeks of light duty, it will no longer feed the paper. It keeps saying it is out of paper, but it isn't. If I ""nudge"" the paper with my finger, it will print.Oh well, I should have known better than to give HP another chance."
2,"If you read one book this year, Read this one.","This is a must read for anyone who cares about the direction our world is heading...For anyone who truly wants to choose world peace...For anyone who has tried to change their own life without success, and wants to know how to choose something different...For anyone who has ever prayed and wondered why the object of their prayer was not forthcoming. It is well written and reads easily, aided by personal anecdotes. It is also well referenced and gives us practical direction based on truths that have been known since ancient times. The prophesies seem to say we are heading for destruction, and we may be....but we have the collective ability to choose that path or not. But we must choose, and Gregg shows us how...how to choose our collective future and our personal one. Bravo Gregg - Well done."
1,Very difficult to put on,The product was very difficult to put on that I just gave up on it. Couldn't return it because the orginal wrapping had been thrown away.
2,Love it!,It was very funny and fun to watch. I my kids and grandchildren really liked it too. They want to watch it over and over again.
2,1984... ahead of its time,"I just finished- literally- reading the book 1984 by George Orwell and my very first thought as I gazed over the last four sentences upon my nook version of the book was anger. Not mad at Orwell, or Winston (the main charterer), more mad at the way it went. Don't worry no spoilers here but as a first time read for this nearly 35 year old guy I can say that I'm glad I waited to read it as I think having done so at a lesser age wouldn't have proved as beneficial an understanding as it did just now.This is a 4+ star book (we'll just round it down to 4 for measures sake) in my opinion simply for the fact that it was able to move me and keep my attention even while not reading it. Recommended"
2,"Kyle ""the yellow dart"" Smith's review","A BRILLIANT READ!!!! Easily the most exceptional book on religion, power, and politics in Colonial St. Augustine from the Florida Museum of Natural History. I found it gripping from front page to last. The way St. Augustine came alive, it was like i was really there. This is a must buy for anyone who finds American history thrilling. Genius! Robert L. Kapitzke is one of the most well versed authors of our time."
2,Psi-Ops: Mindgate Conspiracy,"Awesome game. Great mix of psionic powers and guns. Lots of ""style points"" available by using a mix of your powers to kill the enemies. It does remind me of the Jedi Knights series of games, but those were great, too. The mind drain power shows a head bursting animation reminiscent of the Scanners movies. Definitely well thought out and researched game."
1,Problem with charging smaller AAAs,"I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is."
2,Works Great,"I installed this card in my computer running windows 7 64 bit. Had to connect to internet with wired connection to let windows search for driver. Within a minute it found the correct driver for windows 7, installed it and it immediately found my wi-fi connection. Just had to enter my passwoord and everything is working great."
2,Superb,"When I first heard the singles Aerials and Toxicity I knew I had to check this album out. I read some of the reviews on amazon and were more or less accurate to how I feel about this album. The vibrant 'Prison song' starts the show and sets you up for some serious rocking and it just flows from one song to another so easily. Technically they are brilliant Serj Tankian's voice is so unique and hauntingly changes from madness to mellow in seconds. There are, in my opinion 10 great songs on this album but one to look out for (after the favourites Chop suey,deer dance,Toxicity and Aerials) is 'Forest' the drumming and guitars are mind blowing. Buy this album!"
2,"The Best ""Hound"" Ever","This audiobook is by far the best audio version of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" available today. Reader David Timson does a masterful job. Unlike certain other audio versions where the reader rushes headlong through the book, seemingly without ever pausing for breath, Mr. Timson reads with expression, timing, and style. If you want to hear this novel read the way it should be read, buy the Timson version. It is superb."
2,Admirable!,"Based on her theosophic and new thought principles, these poems had tremendous influence on helping people to come into a sense of personal power and independence. Truly a most inspirational woman!"
2,I love autobiographies of America's forefounders,Good read. Ben Franklin was a pretty amazing man. Learned things about him I never knew until reading his sutobiograhy.
2,Good Buy,"This printer has not caused my any troubles to this date. It's a quality little printer, as all HP products tend to be. The quality is good, but not great. This is an ideal printer for the casual user at home or office. The connection is USB, so the setup was easy. This printer also works well on my home network. If you need a good quality printer at a good price, the deskjet 825c would be an excellent choice."
1,Does not follow the book much. Had to insert all the PC garbage.,"Not bad entertainment...but the book is better, at least according to my wife who chose the movie after reading the book."
2,All Nicolas Cage,"He is such a good actor that he can take this ""plot"" and make a good movie out of it."
2,A Wonderful Composition,"Cummins invites the reader into her family as you take part in each event. She continues with a chronologic order of each happening as you take part by reading the in-depth view of all events, each persons thoughts and the unfortunate truth. This book gives us the knowledge and makes us aware of the tragedy that can happen in any family. Cummins reminds us that a family is ONE, no matter what occurrences take place in life. As a Gaithersburg resident, Volunteer Fire/Rescue worker and a friend of the Cummins family, I encourage all to revisit in the family's heartbreaking tragedy and uplifting story."
1,"""Professional??""","I ordered this as it was advertized as being professional grade, like what you would expect to find in a good health club gym or the like. This ball seems no different than most others i've seen and used. I'm about 210lbs and when i use the ball for any exercise that involves sitting on it or laying on it the ball changes shape temporarily. When i get off of the ball it's not a ball so much as an orb. it returns to a round shape but for being as sturdy as Go-Fit seems to claim this thing seems to be crap. I'd recommend looking for something that is actually heavy duty if that's what you're needing. There are way too many junk exercise balls on the market and this one is a slightly better than average version. The 75cm size is really large too."
2,Religion Review - LSCHS Student,"After reading A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court by Martin DePorres Kennedy, it got me to thinking more about the religion I practice, Catholicism. As the book starts out, Michael, having just tragically losing his father, is thrown into a world; it would seem he is not ready for. As he gets to know his Uncle Les's fundamentalist view of the bible, he begins to realize not everything they practice does follow the bible. He begins to see arguments arise and he himself is challenged on the ways of the bible. The most significant change seemed to be his debate with Pastor Brown. Though Michael had seemed cornered he slipped out of harms way once again. In my opinion, this book gives an excellent overview of the issues that people have disagreed on and also why there was a split within the church. Overall, the book may have seemed boring to some, but the depth of knowledge it provided made me get a deeper understanding of what we really practice at mass."
2,A real-life lesson in leadership,"In the forward, the author remarks that this book will never be used as a textbook in any of the high-level military schools. This is a pity. It is easy to understand the successes achieved by Adm. Gallery's units throughout WWII, and while he is much more modest than other senior officers, there can be little doubt that he is the reason for all these victories. Not only is this a wonderful book for anyone who aspires to be a leader, but it is a tremendously amusing and well-written book."
1,DISAPPOINTED,I was extremely disappointed with the fabric and color when it came. It is obvious that it is of poor quality but I guess you get what you paid for 10 bucks.The zipper of the plastic cover of one set was broken.I bought 2 queen sheets and I wanted to return both purchases if only I did not have to pay for shipping.Do not buy this!!!! You will regret it.
2,great purchase,"great book, great presentation, first time i bought something for kindle. really please so far. looking forward to new titles and new features for kindle."
2,A pleasant surprise,"It's possible I've missed the point and, no, I haven't seen the comics but this movie has to be one of the most (only?) enjoyable in the ""demon"" genre. For the first half-hour I wondered whether I'd made a serious mistake. After that, I learnt to enjoy the ride and the laughs.I'm now entirely convinced the movie was intended to be tongue-in-cheek, entertaining and stimulating - in all of which it has succeeded. It definitely presses a few buttons and perhaps its detractors' funny bones were bumped a little too hard?"
2,Great Start,"Lets face it. The music industry would have NEVER discovered this young man. Gangly, southern, loves his mother... But he truly IS a pop star. This album proves it. The songs sound a tad bit over-produced and there really isn't an original 'feel' to this CD, but for some reason, my wife and I can't seem to get enough of it. We think because the CD underscores and carries the sincerity that shone through during his metamorphosis on American Idol. He's the long-shot that won (albeit second, he far outshines the rest). And this album is a winner of sorts. We'll buy his next one so we can continue to enjoy watching him grow and change as an artist. Just like he did on TV."
2,Sadly...One and done.,"For those of you who remember those early days of the 1990's, where Big Hair, Cross Colours, and great dance music. New Jack was at it's absolute height, Damian Dame delivered a musical masterpiece with their debut album. I loved every track on the CD, and after all these years, I recently found a copy of the CD and have been listening to it and enjoying it. ""Love Come Near Me"", and ""Virgin Island"" are among my favorite cuts. Sadly, both members of the group died on the exact same day two years apart, one from cancer, and the other from injuries sustained in a car accident. Never the less, they delivered a beautiful album on the LaFace label."
1,One of my favorite toys!,This Blue Eyes Shining Dragon is awesome! I got it for Christmas and I played with it all day. The one I got came with the card Shadow Spell. It's a cool toy so if you can't find anything at Toys 'R' Us or somthing buy this!
1,lesson in depravity of man,"As I opened this book, I thought to myself ""Wow! This seems like a great story!"" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember...."
1,Dumb,"basicall a rip off of the some of the earlier renissance works, ie: decameron, cantebury tales, inferno, candid, etc... good for the high school student trying to organize his mind."
1,Disappointing,After all the good reviews I read of this book I thought I would love it. Usually I enjoy biographies. I found that this book is written in a style that makes the story a bit difficult to follow. I gave it my best shot but I did not enjoy it at all.
2,clan of the cave bear,"this book opened my mind to the life of the first people and strugles they indured. she showed rational method as to how many discoveries could have come about. riding a horse for the first time must have been a true sight, it is taken for granted by us today but can you inagine what it must have been like to wittnes this for the first time. i have read all her books several times and been just as awe struck by every one."
1,"Too many names, too little interest.","This book needs a grammar check. It is incomprehensible. I am trying to return it. It sucks, to coin a pun."
1,Wrestlecrap,This is very slow and very limited. It has better graphics than Road to Wrestlemania but does not compare to it in anyway in terms of gameplay.Also it doesn't have STONE COLD STONE COLD THE RATTLESNAKE STONE COLD
1,Zzzzzzz,"I found Hard Times to be a particularly boring novel. I also purchased the matching audiobook which I listened to on a long drive. There should be a warning label! The darn thing puts you to sleep faster than listening to Stephen Hawking all day...anesthetized! Why not one star? I like Dickens, what can I say?"
2,Great! But wanted more story about Ramsey.,"I really loved this book, but I had been waiting since ""The Secret"" for a story that I hoped would focus on Ramsey Sinclair, as he was written to be the more ""irresistible"". I enjoyed Brodick but didn't find his character in ""The Secret"" to be that exciting. At any rate, ""Ransom"" is well written and I did enjoy reading it."
2,well worth it,"The ultimate, classic Big American Horn. I've been playing one for 25 years and it has never let me down. Everyone has their preferences, so I can't recommend it to everybody, but at least give it a try before you make you decision to spend this amount of money."
1,not compatable with the jawbone.,produce is not compatable with the jawbone. design does not provide a snug fit to the bluetooth unit. a waste of money
1,Do Not Buy This Scanner,"I purchased this scanner about 18 months ago and paid a great deal of money for it (purchased elsewhere). I work in a professional graphic studio and needed a large flatbed. The first scanner arrived DOA, and it was returned. The second scanner died within one week. Recently, I started to notice severe color variations. This is after months of other problems, including scans that had shadows where there were none, and strange color patterns most of which I was able to correct in PhotoShop. Talking to technical support was useless, I would email them the scans that had very visible problems and they would claim it would look perfect on their monitor. I finally got hold of a supervisor who told me that the scanner was broken and would need repair, which would cost at least a few hundred dollars, plus shipping costs. Have decided to avoid further aggravation and just buy a new scanner, which will not be Microtek."
2,Educating Rita,"One of my all-time favorite movies. Superb acting, realistic but heart-warming story of a working class woman hungry for knowledge. Also a well done examination of the difference between erudition and education. So many poignant scenes, especially one in a pub where everybody is singing, and the mother recognizes the empty life they lead with the quiet statement, ""There must be better songs to sing."" A must-see movie."
1,this book was a big dissapointment,"I found this book to be very out of date. I can't count how many times I read ""coming in 2000"" and then no info on the subject. I didn't expect this from a book written for 2001. I have the 2000 official guide and it is much more up to date. The only thing I liked about the book is the coverage of non disney parks. This book was a huge waste of money."
1,Poor quality,"I have only had them a week and already they are falling apart, I would not recommend them to anyone"
1,"Keanu Reeves, need I say more?","Has there ever been a movie with Keanu Reeves in it that had any merit to it? He is one of the worst actors on the screen today. Whenever I see that he is in a film, I know I'm going to be in for a bad time. Despite that truth, I dared to risk it once again and rented this movie. I wasn't disappointed. Save your money folks. Keanu reached his peak in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. It's been downhill ever since."
2,What the music industry fears most!!!!,"A clean cut album from a TRUE clean cut artist.You can listen to this cd with anyone and not fear the messages like today's music.Each song can fit a person's past or feelings so well. Most of us have endured the hardships, love, and blessings that this young man sings of.Do not be fooled by the bad reviews by the industry paid critics and reviewers. They say this cd is bad because the industry fears Clay and his fans.The music industry says we all want to hear hip hop - rap - sex - infidelity messages. LOL GUESS WHAT??Listen up record producers. If this was true, tell me why Clay Aiken is the hottest thing in MUSIC today, period???His music is outselling ANYTHING put out by 95% of the so called stars today."
2,the second best adam sandler film,"this is a fantastic film i may be biased as i love adam sandler but believe me it really is!!!!! sum people dont like him cos he can b too stupid but in this film u have the odd bit of the typical adam sandler style but not much throughout the film, its like a cross between the wedding singer ( best film ever made) and groundhog day only really really funny drew and adam have a fantastic on screen chemistry that just makes them so believeable as a couple, n who could resist the charms of adam sandler. i would recommened this to all existing adam sandler & drew barrymore fans and those who think sandler is too stupid watch this and ull b pleasantly surprised."
1,Worst Animated Film of 2004,"Well, we saw this garbage on opening day. I took my 5-year-old who loves the Spongebob cartoon. It seemed like it was nearly completely devoid of humor. Don't understand how most of the ""reviewers"" on this site reviewed the film BEFORE they've seen it. As a Spongebob fan, I'm very disappointed. This is one I won't be buying when it goes to video. Flat plot, drawn-out story and it seemed like it would never end. Even the truly funny bits (I counted about 4) didn't make up for the boredom we suffered. Save your $!"
2,"Wow, Great reception","I had an old Linksys WUSB11 connected to my Tivo series 2 to link it to my wireless network. It was slow as a dog! My signal strength hovered around 7 to 10% and often the Tivo would fail in it's attempts to download files. I just installed this Tivo G adaptor and my signal strength increased to 94%. Now my downloads are much, much faster! I don't know why I didn't upgrade before. Installation was a snap. I unplugged the old one and ran the new cable w/ this one. The WUSB11 uses a standard USB connector on both ends and this Tivo one uses a miniUSB on the device end and standard USB connector on the Tivo side. I went to the settings / network page on the Tivo and directed it to connect to my existing wireless network and it connected. The key thing is that I did NOT have to restart the Tivo or reset the network to get this to connect - it was very, very simple"
1,Poor quality and lousy customer service,"The Squeem is a great idea, but their quality is second rate, and their customer service is worse than useless. I'd owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched. The threads aren't frayed; they're unstitching from the seam.Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility. They've asked for pictures of the damage, and then failed to respond to the pictures, or any further attempts to contact them.For what this costs, it needs to last longer than 4 weeks."
2,It's great,"It's great. it is heavy snow outside, but the diaper arrived on time. very thing is good.thank you for your service and product."
2,Another winner from Douglas & Olshaker,"The cases that haunt us is a mesmerizing read. I did not put it down until I finished it. I have read all of Douglas's & Olshaker's books,and as usual the information presented in the book is well researched. The book is well-written and Douglas's behavioral analysis on each of the subjects is brilliant. What I found most compelling was the way in which Douglas and Olshaker paint a vivid picture of life during the times of the Ripper, Borden and Lindbergh cases. In this essence, the book was quite visual. This book is a must read for any Douglas fan or anyone wishing to experience his expertise for the first time."
2,Ten stars!,I am crazy about this cd. I got it today. Thanks Amazon for your quick service. My favorite songs are Perfect Day and Shine. They are brilliant songs with a beautiful message. Clay's voice soars in strength and sicerity. Don't miss this album!
1,CHEAP! DO NOT BUY!!,"I bought this product because it was less expensive than the Pampers Cruisers and I thought it might a comparable product. WRONG!! Simply picking up the product, you can tell it isn't made as well and has a more plastic feel to it. I only gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it a ""0"". By the next day, my son had a diaper rash like none I have ever seen. My husband and I have practically had to hog-tie him to put ointment on his bottom or even bathe him. He even cried when he was sitting. We switched back to Cruisers and he is healing, thankfully, but still has marks two weeks later. We will NEVER buy this product again. Do not walk, RUN from this product."
1,This is Painfully SH*T!!!,"After the high quality of the first two films there's only one way to go...downhill and fast.This film put plain and simply is pants! A crappy japanese cyborg is created as the new nemesis for robocop, & it looks exactly like a human.A piss-take of the first two films rolled into one, what a disaster...ignore this film."
1,Prison Rape,"Anyone who objects to making light of rape, including prison rape, should refuse to buy this book. If you're a Christian, ask yourself if laughing at rape is the moral standard you want to uphold. If you're a humanitarian, vote with your dollar and boycott Borowitz' glib joke about rape, even the rape of others who have harmed us."
2,good for accompanying,"I bought this CD originally when I was in junior high, to accompany me while I practiced my saxophone (I preferred to practice to Beach Boys music over the school fight song). Anyway, it's also good for karaoke. However, be careful listening to the previous reviewer, who either can't count or has a different CD. There are 15 tracks on the CD, which last I checked is *not* over 20."
1,Horrible and boring,it is impossible to keep reading this...it is very hard to understand and most parts don't make any sense...it is very hard to understand.
1,unvoluntarily ridiculous,"Keep your hands of this movie, it definitley aint worth watching.The story is thinner than a crack ho on her last day on earth, unvoluntarily ridiculous and so placatively wanna-be-patriotic that homeland security shines outta your butt when ya bother watching this crappy movie.One of the worst movies i ve seen in years."
2,THE BEST BATMAN EVER,This movie IS Batman. Everyone (except young children) will love this movie. Period. Gary Oldman is great as Sgt. Gordon. The origins of the Batman legends are very well handled.
1,Drawn Out,"100 Years of Solitude is a dense, confusing novel that is seemingly endless. Most of the characters have the same name - either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano for the boys and Amaranta or Remedios for the girls. The chapters are long and have large amounts of action. Most of the chapters are very similar: incest occurs, a child is born, named Jose Arcadio, he studies Melquiades, fights with some people, has a mistress, several children, and then dies. I do not recommend this book for anyone that wants a quick/easy/interesting read. It is well written and conveys many themes and such, but is purely painful to read."
1,Really really small,"Let me start by saying there is nothing ""wrong"" with these weights. The quality is great, and the material is soft. However, when people say small...they mean it! I am a petite size 2 and they only barely fit. I actually got these for therapy use for my one-year old's ankles and these were the only one-pounders I could find. They fit my chuncky little one just perfectly."
1,I'm Baffled,"I've tried a couple of times to read this book, and honestly, I never got past the first page. I think it's the biggest hoax ever perpetrated on a gullible literary world, and if James Joyce was sane (as I seriously doubt) then he must have had a huge laugh at its expense. However, I think he must've been totally nuts to write such garbed nonsense.I read the glowing reviews by other readers praising Joyce's ""genius"" and begin to doubt my own sanity. Is it possible I just can't read as well as I've always thought I can?However, I truly think they're just afraid to express their real opinion, after so many have called this thing a work of genius."
1,dissapointment,If you're getting this DVD for the trains like i was don't bother unless you're looking for 2 Thomas trains. You're not going to get Donald like the picture shows.
2,Overall Good Book,"Book was great and a nice read... but the cover was dirty, don't know why Amazon would sell a dirty book."
1,Of Mice and Men,"Three crucial pages were torn from the book: The ""Introduction by Susan Shillinglaw""(Director of the Steinbeck Research Center); ""Suggestions for Further Reading""; and ""A Note on the Text."" Since I was reading the book for a class discussion, these items would have aided me greatly during the discussion period."
2,good artwork too!,"The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs."
1,Very Low Quality Recordings,Nirvana should be ashamed of having this released. If it's the best of the box then the rest of the box must be overdriven drunken slobbering screams accompanied by smashing guitars and kicking drums. If you like unprofessional recordings you will love these. My guess is these were recovered from the trash somewhere to make a quick buck. Although if they are demos it's a wonder Nirvana got anywhere.
2,gift,This was brought for my husband to finish his set. He has all of the seasons. It was one of our favorite shows on tv and it will be missed . at least this way we can watch it over and over .
2,A Review,"My name is Laura, and I am doing this review for my english pre ap summer assinment from JMS. I thought this book had a good plot, but it was kind of hard fo me to understand. Some of the parts of the book I had to read three or four times to figure it out. Though at parts I was lost I did love the book, and I would definately recommend it to some one else."
1,"Be careful when searching for ""3-D movies""","I used the search window using ""3-d movies"" as the criteria and this movie popped up along with dozens of other 3-d movies, but when I received it, I realized I had not read the description close enough to see that this movie was NOT 3-d. Amazon-please don't place 2-d movies selections in with the 3-d ones! I had to pay $2.98 to return an item that shouldn't have been offered in a search of 3-d movie selections. Ouch. All in all I love Amazon, but I'll be more careful in the future. My bad."
1,"Boring, Dull, one of the worst books ever written","This book was a total waste of my time. don't get me wrong though im a very avid reader but, DAG!! was Dickens intending for his book to be so boring or did it just mistakenly happen. The characters were hard to understand and so was the plot. ONe character in particular got on my last nerve: the circus person (can't remember his name because it was just that unimportant). He talked with a lipse which was hard to read."
2,Gets the job done right!,I have two long haired cats and these are by far my favorite lint rollers--super sticky and gets the job done in record time.
2,This was the best book that I have ever read!,Foundation is the complete book of adventure. Brilliantly written by Asimov (as usual). This book is a must-read for all readers!
1,rocket science,I cannot wait to return this item to Babies R Us. I tried to assemble it at home and the only thing I succeeded in was amusing my daughter. It's not easy to put together at all!
1,Simply awful,"I know its very hard to bring a book like Moby-Dick to the screen, but at least John Houston tried in the 1950's. This made-for-TV adaptation makes me wonder if the screenwriters and director even read the original book. Not only is the character of Queegueg depicted incorrectly as a Mauri of New Zealand (in reality Melville based the character on the Nuku-Hivans), but he is treated as a buffoonish and stereotypical ""savage"" which is completely at odds with the dignified character that Melville created. Additionally, the filmmakers dreamt up a bizarre scene where the Pequod is stranded in the ice of the Antarctic! They must have been reading Mary Shelly's Frankenstien at the time. Patrick Stewart's performance as Ahab however, is wonderful, but that's the only redeeming feature of this overblown mess."
2,Lauren's 6th birthday,"I bought this for my daughters 6th birthday she loves all animals, she likes to make cards and pictures with the stamps. She loves this set and I love the pictures she makes!"
1,THE WORST THING EVER CREATED,"I'm sure you can see by now with everyone else's reviews that this product is garbage. Well, hey, if you pay close to nothing, don't expect anything much in return! Just save yourself the money and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT... instead, put some gas in your car or something!"
2,"Jungle? Not so sure, but definitely classic","These tracks were taken from back when RDJ and pals were throwing parties, etc. simply for a lack of things to do.I'd say it is techno of the old-school kind, something I rather miss. Some tracks are a bit trancy, and I suppose the second track does have junglist elements, but all in all, this is music to dance to. IDM indeed."
2,What an Interesting Book!,"I read this book for a book club and I really enjoyed it. It was very thought provoking, and I am sure that we will have a lot to discuss. It didn't grab me into the book, I could set it down when I needed to, but it was still really good."
2,Great Airbed,"I looked at several airbeds before buying this one. I looked at several name brands, I was not familiar with Intex so I checked the reviews and am glad I did. Fast delivery, easy set up (a must for me) and a very sturdy product. We are completely satisfied with this bed. The built in pump is easy to use and works perfectly. We bought the twin due to space but intend to buy a larger bed to have on hand."
1,one mess after another,"I have been pleased with the regular pampers size 1, but I'm very disappointed with the Baby Dry Size 1. They are significantly smaller than the regular size 1 diapers and do not cover the back of my baby, so it's been one mess and clothing change after another."
2,Fair and Ballanced Survey,"Do not believe the charges of anti-semitism.This book is critical of both sides but based on exhaustive research into primary sources: the files of the Israeli government and army. If you only want to hear the propaganda from one side or another, avoid this book.I would criticize the maps as inadequate, a detailed map of the region in the endpaper would have been just the thing. Also, the author assumes a familiarity with people and events in the areawhich went well beyond my knowledge, until I read the book.Update: 10 December 2002Wow. I got a ton of ""unhelpful"" votes for the above review. My review was not particularly well written, nor spell checked (now corrected!), nor was it detailed. But 17 out of 85 unhelpful? I wonder, wonder what is going on."
2,"Good book, small format","I love that this book is light and small. My only complaint is that it is hardcover with a dustjacket--something more durable would be more practical for toting along to the campfire.This is really a book of standards, not an all-encompassing book of some of the more modern songs you might have sung as Girl/Boy Scout. Standards include Amazing Grace, America, Home on the Range, Kumbayah, Old MacDonald, Skip to My Lou, Taps, This Old Man. All songs have the music written out for the first verse, and all verses are included."
1,Didn't get the job done,"I ordered it for a wart on my knee. Although I did see it begin to work by turning the wart black, this was a very thin layer. After the thin layer turned black and fell off I began the process again. Again, (2 weeks later) a thin layer turned black. I used this wart stick for almost 2 months before I grew sick of it's results and went to the doctor to have it frozen off."
2,A household name...,"I loved this movie when I first saw it, and still love it, after seeing it about 30 times. So who cares if the trick blower can't be made? Everytime I think about replacing my gas guzzling 454 truck, this film reminds me that there really ain't many things in life as sweet as a rumbling V8. A perfect guy movie. For whatever reason, most women just don't get it. BE WARNED though. The original release was overdubbed with cheezy american voices. Amazon does not carry the restored version. We all know what Mel Gibson's voice sounds like, and listening to some bad voiceover now makes me want to puke. Please Amazon, carry the original, letterboxed version on VHS."
1,Not reader worthy,"I bought this to review it for content and usability, I can't believer what I read. This book has nothing useful in it! It don't tell you anything about what to say or even how to figure out what type of woman you want let alone how to get her to respond to you. It's just full of useless information like horoscopes I culdn't believe it, it even had the chinese horoscope taken off of some menu in a restaurant! This book doesn't do anything buy take your money and waste a tree."
1,one of the worst Cannes winners,"That movie was soooo boring. An old teacher living together with her mum, whom she hates, very blunt loud dialogues between them, why does an independent self supporting lady stay there at all, ridiculous..I was very, very disappointed of actress Huppert's role, it was not her fault, that she had so little to do or say, eg in that scene on the public toilet.E. Jelinek's story was either not transported or is it really so far away from real life, or sex, or even perverse perversion?I did not even try to find out, too much time spent on that already. Sorry."
1,Would rather watch grass grow,"I have seen many many movies in my life and this one takes the cake as being the biggest waste of time, terrible film I have EVER seen. Honestly, to think someone actually made this movie makes me believe anyone can make a movie. Everything about this movie is just so bad it makes me want to vomit."
2,Large,"What strikes me the most is how roomy this tent is, though it's not possible to stand up straight. It works well for 4 people, though 6 might be too much. I like having a little wiggle rom for getting dressed without stepping on someone.It appears to be waterproof, though I haven't been in a big rainstorm yet, just very wet fog. Zippers work well and I like the color of the tent. The view from the inside ""windows"" is great and makes it airy if needed.The reason why I give it an average+ rating is that it's impossible to set up by myself. Somehow with advances in modern tent design I had expected that I could do it by myself."
1,Beautiful People. Beautiful Scenery. Not so beautiful Plot,"Beautiful Scenery. Beautiful People. Thin Plot. Diane Lane is gorgeous in this film and her performance was excellent - she just needed a better script to work with. Her friendship with the men who remodel her house is one of the good things in the film. Much of the rest of the film is just too much escapism for me. Why do movies seem to always portray the solution to pain and heartache as running away and starting a new life? I would think that if I was hurting - the last thing I would want is to be thousands of miles away from my closest friends and family. And in a new culture, where I didn't speak the language?"
2,The best book ever!,"Orphaned Kit Tyler feels trapped in the bleak shores of Connecticut Colony. She hates to work and when she is forced to do so she leaves it unfinished. She hates her uncle, marvels at her cousin Mercy's patience, feels sorry for her aunt and tries to bear her annoying and selfish cousin Judith. The only place where she truly feels free and happy is in the meadows with her friend Nat and The Witch of the Blackbird Pond as the puritans call her. She also tries to keep patience with her husband-to-be. But things turn out different for her in the end. As she looks for peace in her life, she is accused for witchcraft which she can escape with the help of her seafaring friend Nat. But he is not just a friend, he is more than that. And as Kit searches for her answers she gets the results even she couldn't imagine..."
2,A comidy thriller,"Jessie Woods,my great great Aunt, has had such a wonder and histerical life. Her facinating stories of her early life as a wing walker, have been put in a book that couldn't of been written any better. I would recomend this book to any one who is looking for a good laugh and some teeth gripping tales o walking on the wing."
1,Shockumentary: Extreme Collection,"I was very dissatisfied with this purchase because after I received the product, I found out that it was in a different language and I couldn't understand anything on the cd's."
1,How can I write a book ? I to can ask my neighbors!,It is not worth buying ! If this a must read for you go to our public library. You just might thank me!
2,The Best Album Of 2001,"SYSTEM OF A DOWN's TOXICITY is the greatest hard rock album of 2001 and System Of A Down is one of the best bands out of the so called ""NU-METAL"" scene. This is a great album because it is heavy and fast and has meaning. System Of A Down is a Excellent band. My favorite songs on this album are:NeedlesDeer DanceChop SueyBounceForestToxicityPsychoAerials"
1,Needs a good editor,"Interesting concept, some interesting characters, but too much. The language gets so heavy handed -- how many similes and metaphors can you take -- and melodrama, boy! At times this book was like reading the worst sections of Anne Rice's Violin over and over and over ... Yeah, yeah, yeah .. I got it already! Move on."
2,"Great book, skip intro, expensive ebook","Loved the book. But if you read it, skip the intro! It is extremely spoiling for the plot, it annoys me that it wasn't put at the end. After reading a couple of spoilers I skipped it. Similarly, it annoys me that the ebook is the most expensive option.Other than that I find this an epic book, a must read."
1,Sold a bad product,The DVD was used and revealed and was broken and would not play which was very displeasing. They did rerun the item but never shipped me a working DVD
1,Farm or Blocks?,"This toy is quite small. I think when you see this toy, should think if you are going for the block or farm concept. Whichever one it is, either get another farm toy or blocks. (Mega Blocks) Also animals roam, they don't jump, so when child plays they wouldn't naturally want to stick the animal in the block numerous times to get where they are going. Just my thoughts."
1,"NICE, BUT TRUST ME DONT BUY","Well, i bought this monitor about 2 months ago.. at the time i also needed a tv..so i thought this was a great buy..took it home set it up and boy it was awesome...the picture was great..(internet)....evrything was fine until about a month after i noticed that it would just shut down..then i would try to turn it back on and it wouldnt..so it takes for me to unplug for a few min then restart..since then it still shuts down..or freezez...i think that this item in general is defective..i noticed other people had the same problem..as of right now im waiting for my replacement..."
1,Air cleaners that do not clean the air,"According to Consumer Reports tests, the Sharper Image Ionic cleaners do not clean the air."
2,One of my Favorites Growing Up,This book was required reading at least twice in grade school and I never complained. Something about it made it an instant classic in my mind. I fell in love with the characters!! It's short and sweet but still a wonderful read.
2,It works!,It's good price and works as expect. After a month of use it still going strong. The plug is sung. It keeps the headphone attached firmly.
1,"Interesting, but read the fine print....","Ok, we have seen the movie, some of us have read Keel's book (this being a reprint). What no one seems to mention is the fine print located on the copyright page, which reads: ""This is a work of fiction. All the characters and events portrayed in this book are either products of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously."" If you don't believe me, glance at the copyright page. Obviously, this paperback edition was prepared as a movie tie-in. Touted as a ""true event"" the publisher then informs us it is all a work of the ""author's imagination."" And therein must lie a lot of truth. Yes, the book is mildly entertaining, if a bit choppy in parts. My advice is, read THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES with a large dose of salt (and the movie is much better)."
1,not bad for a cheap knife!,"cheap, light weight, quite flexible, doesn't hold a sharp edge very well- but what do you expect from a cheap knife? I bought it because I liked the shape!Use it, abuse it then throw it away or sell at your next ""I'll never do it again"" garage sale."
1,Booooring!!,This game is way to easy. The camara gets all twichi and there's not enough weapons.There are some cars that may be impossible to unlock(I think that way because you need to get to mission #18).I highly reccomend to rent it before buying it.
1,"I still have not recieved the book I ordered 11-19. So I can't really give an opinion,",I still have not recieved my book that I ordered 11-19.I have filed a claim. I can not give an opinion about the book.
2,Kim's review,"These classes were a lot better than I expected. Most of the infomration was refresher, but there were several things that I never knew. The instructer doing the classes is hilarious, and my husband actually sat down and enjoyed watching them. These were much easier for him since he doesn't do well in a class room setting."
2,this is simply the best album of 2001,"and one of the most distinctive and beautiful albums in the history of rock music.i won't even attempt to describe this album, other than that if you're at all turned off by the screaming - don't worry. something about this cd voids that screaming down to just music. it's more ""shouting"" rather than screaming, if you know what i mean...it's just an incredibly beautiful cd, but it is the epitome of the ""let it sink in"" album.you most likely will not like this album the first time you hear it, almsot definitely if you're already in no way familiar with them, but it will sink in. it isn't silly, this is emotional music. it's beautiful and deep music. it's art in a very unpretentious honest way. just get it.~ will"
2,Purchased for my Gram,"This was a present for my grandma, she loves it, nuff said. Not my type of music, but hey as long as she is happy."
2,Great book,"This is a great introduction to economic analysis. It is very well written and the examples are still surprisingly current.Bad economic thinking plagues the political and mediatic scene. Hazlitt focuses his effort on a key mistake, that of ignoring the unseen possibilities (or opportunity cost)."
1,utterly underwhelming,"This book has received a lot of attention and is selling well---but that's a testament to the power of the marketing machine that's been fired up behind it, not to the book itself. Search back articles from the Wall Street Journal if you want to read about how the marketing was done. You'll learn very little from reading the book itself, though."
2,Great CD,"Received the cd yesterday, listened to it many times. Not usually a fan of pop music but have to say this is the exception.Clear, precise lyrics and catchy music combine to make an enjoyable audio experience."
2,Plug it in and it works!,"Pull the battery saver tab, plug the unit into the wall and plug-in the device you want to control and everything works! I tried it from 25 feet away and through one wall and the remote turned my device on and off without a hitch!"
2,AMAZING series,"I have difficulty putting into words just how much each of the Earth's Children books have transformed my way of thinking. Auel's ability to create characters who use our natural resources for the greatest good has strong appeal. Each book has spun a world of reality-based fantasy which can guide how we see the world today. The world of Ayla, the Clan, and the Others is one in which EVERYONE should enter... and decide to stay."
2,"great story, well directed, fine acting","This movie is quite a gem. Not the usual American fare, very refreshing and well told story. I gave it five stars because I couldn't give it six!"
1,No lessons learned,"This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon.The book is one long, myopic, libertarian apology."
2,"Brillent! Exellent! the best alblum, ever!","if you love garbage this is the one to have.GREAT songs such as ""i think i'm paranoid"",special,""when i grow up"" and push it.this is a deffenet one to get.if it's $16.00 or E16.00 or whatever it costs. version 2.0 is an essentail alblum.so go and buy it and add it to your collection."
1,May not appeal to toddler,"My 3-year old toddler loved playing ""snatch-the-toast"" from her toy toaster so I bought her the crocodile dentist. However, she is scared stiff of the clamping action and refused to play with it. She started removing the sticker-eyes and -nostrils instead. Toy is durable per se but stickers can be easily removed. I had to glue them back with superglue, which is better lasting. I came to a conclusion that she is still too young to play with the crocodile dentist and I intend to keep it for her later on."
2,Works great with Windows 7,"Just got this card for my new Windows 7 machine. Worked great after I got the RA link drivers from their website. Seems fast, doesn't lose connections, the antenna seems sturdy. Right now only using it with 802.11b but it seems fast enough!"
1,A real downer,"If you are looking for a french romantic film, this is not it! Wow, a real downer, and quite perverse. If you like true tragedies, then I think it would be a good film. The acting is quite good. At one point the main character tries to make love to her own mother. The whole movie was just too disturbing for me."
1,Do not buy this Brand!!!,"I was originally pleased with the make of the washer but the connector between the washer and hose broke, when i ordered the replacement parts it took them over 1 ""YEAR"" to get the replacement parts to me. That is not a typo and i find it ignorant that it took that long to replace a plastic part that they should have had mass produced with plenty of spares. Do not buy, the customer service is horrible and the machine breaks easily, not to mention to get it fixed takes a year."
2,Great family movie for Older kids,"This is a great story about the classic battle of good versus evil. Well written, beautiful views and adventure to keep kids interested. My kids also like the talking Narnian animals. If you like the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, you will like this also. The next one is the Voyage of the Dawn Treader, another well loved ""Chronicle'' in the series:)"
1,"Six months past, I never get the magazine.","I never get my magazine, it turns out to be the company got the wrong address. So i have to wait another 4~5 months to get my magazine. I can't get my magazine until June or July. Making me so upset!"
2,One of my favorites,"This is one of the better Adam Sandler movies I've seen. It is funny and heart-warming, without going over the top. I don't always like Drew, but she does a great job in this one. A really great movie!"
2,Best Batman Film,"This is the best version of Batman to ever hit the screen. It beat Tim Burton's 1989 version all to pieces and back again. It is dark, stylish, and true enough to the comics to make die hards happy without alienating moviegoers who are not up to speed on the comics. Think of it as a wink wink, nudge nudge by use of character names only comic readerswould know.The cast is absolutely superb. Christian Bale brings just the right amount of tormented soul to Bruce Wayne, Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred, and Katie Holmes is as pretty as always. Add in the usual fantastic performances by Morgan Freeman and Liam Neesom, and you have the best comic book based film ever.Please suppot this film so we can get bigger and better movies featuring comic book characters."
2,Regular 'ol Charger,"Plain old charger that comes with the sd870is that I forgot the charger for when I went home for Christmas. Works just fine.The only thing that I can complain about is Amazon's shipping; I ordered it with 2-day shipping and since I ordered it the tracking said that it would arrive Dec. 22nd. Well, the 22nd came and went, then when I checked the tracking it said that it was on time and would arrive the 23rd. Wait, if it was on time then it would have arrived the 22nd...? OK... Thanks Amazon, so much for 2-day shipping..."
1,Too much talking for me.,An Italian guy with an itchy scalp waits for dessert to ask an Italian woman to marry him. Meanwhile his brother with a wooden hand and a pizza shop and their mother try to stop the wedding. There's a lot of strange cultural dialogue and customs in this movie I did not understand. If you don't enjoy listening to a lot of conversation in kitchens and bedrooms I would avoid this one.
2,ONE OF ALL-TIME FAVORITES!,"This story felt like I was living there...feeling, tasting, sweating, right along with the characters. I would have sworn Gloss was taking this word for word from the woman's diary. Being thrilled by such everyday struggles like getting a mule down the hill..now thats what I call virtual reality. I was so enthralled by the ""cowboys""...kept thinking I never would have dreamed I'de love a book like this so much...but it was so true and delicious. Thanks for taking me to Oregon in the 1890's. It was a thrilling, amazing adventure. The struggle's the pioneers endured were incredible...so much more so for a woman, and a woman alone at that!"
2,Flawless,"Worked like a charm all over England. I haven't tried the other adaptors, but I found my MacBook to work just like it does here in the US, and there was no difficulty plugging into the outlets."
1,"depth, but not 3d","i bought a system like this today (razor 3d the ultimate 3d experience) and have tried 3 dvds with it, used all the different settings, and so far it offers more depth perception, but is definitely not jump-off-the-screen 3d. i was disappointed"
1,Back to basics,"Generally speaking a great book if you are not familiar with management accounting and turning heaps of information into valuable reports for your top management group. No doubt about it: This book will provide the basic tools for keeping your boss happy, especially if you need a brush-up on moving averages, etc. Having vast experience with both advanced financial and non-financial analysis on various aspects of business (shipping and construction), this book was somewhat a let down in terms of ability to inspire and provide ways to improve personal skills to structure and present complex topics in an ordered and clear fashion. A nice bedtable-reader for the pre-MBA. MBAs should look elsewhere."
1,Yet Another Lousy Crowes Album,Boned-out pot boys desperate to regroup and recoup a fanbase.This pretty much confirms it. The Black Crowes are washed up.
1,"Pathetic attempts at humor, overall bad writing.","I generally enjoy watching old movies, but this is not one of the good ones. While Hitchcock managed a few decent movies, I think he was LARGELY overrated.The story is thin, attempted humor is more annoying than funny (as is Peter Lorre), in general the writing is bad and the acting not so great. Our war spies end up getting credit for a job they couldn't/didn't even do - they were pathetic and so was the whole setup which makes the USA look foolish and incompetent. In fact, the more I think about this movie after watching it, the more I dislike it.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. Sorry."
1,Fascinating,"Actually, Taco Bell DOES sell ChocoTacos - I just had one myself! As a Mormon, I have to say that I found this book mildly amusing. The ""carefully hidden secrets"" about the founders of the church have never been hidden from me. There is nothing in Mormonism that is ""covered up"" - everyone is free, and encouraged, to learn as much as they possibly can! What the missionaries teach is the truth - the basic beliefs of the church. If you study them, the other controversial topics that come up have little relevancy to what we actually believe and what we practice. I have studied many religions and I've found that even among ""mainstream"" Christians there is a wide range of beliefs. It is the same for Mormons, and yet people are continually telling us what we do and don't believe! Really astounding when you think about it."
1,Not a Huge Fan,Monique was a bit to much. Didnt really enjoy her on the mic. Loved Paul Mooney piece it was way to short. And the last comedian Corey was funny. But I wouldnt recommend anyone else to buy it. If your buying it to hear Paul Mooney's Piece your better off waiting until his new stand comes out next month. Monique ruined the DVD.
1,Too Soft - Not firm - Loses Air Quickly - Not good for Chair,"As stated in the subject line, this product may be a good fitness ball but not firm enough to be a chair."
2,Hi Tec Altitude 4 mens boot,Comfortable boots that are indeed water proof and actually do breathe. They seem to work well for the winter wearing anything from cotton socks to solar socks depending on the outside temperatures. It should be noted that they do not have a slip resistance sole so they can be slippery on smooth wet surfaces. I haven't had a chance to use them in warmer weather to see fully how well they breathe. For the price they are a very good buy.
1,Do not be suckered!,"There is nothing in the title or on the cover to indicate that this is a book whose sole intention is to convert you to Christianity.The first two pages are about anger, but by page three you are being told that Jesus loves you.Sad, that religious people feel the need to deceive others in order to get out their message."
1,Don't Bother,"This was a free kindle purchase. I guess you get what you pay for with the Kindle.This was absolute drivel! This writer neither knows southerners nor humour. The story was so unbelievable, it was laughable. Could not finish this pile of ..."
1,Break too easily,"My step-daughter got a set of glasses, and 3 family members cut themselves because they broke as they were washing them. I thought I'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what I thought of as the quality name brand Anchor Hocking. She already got a different set of glasses, so I kept them for myself. One was broken in the box when I opened them up. I thought no big deal. I started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, I am down to only one large one and four small ones. I also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. My daughter informed me that these were the EXACT glasses she experienced the same problems with. I am sorry to discover that Anchor Hocking is no longer going to be associated with quality, as it used to be in the past."
2,As described,The product was delivered to me as described. Got what I wanted. A sturdy dowel. Who could complain about that?
2,Fantastic!!!,"This item is great! Very clear instructions/illustrations and explanations for use. Light, compact, waterproof. Covers all the most useful knots and then some. Get this, it's a no brainer."
2,Very Pleased Customer,"My husband asked me to send this in.He is very very pleased with these Bill Blass shirts.Comfortable, good colors, wash great.He does not understand the comments about Thin fabric......this is a good weight fabric and not too heavy.Also the collar stays are permanently sewn into colllar instead of the removable type. Why id this a problem? This way they do not get lost.Try these shirts .....they are good."
2,Amazing little gadget!,"I went to a granddaughter's birthday party today with my wife. The other grandparents were there, other people as well, kids and grownups both. Someone started playing with the Q20 and it passed from one person to another. One of my grandkids thought ""toilet"" and it guessed right away correctly. This is a great little novelty item. I see that it's out of stock now at Amazon. Backorder it or snatch it up wherever you see it as a stockting stuffer."
2,Fantastic,I recently purchased this memory book for one of my sisters who is expecting her first baby soon and she was so grateful. She loved it and now I am considering buying more for other relatives who are expecting..
2,I LOVE THIS CD!!!,"I bought this cd the first day it came out and haven't removed it from my cd player yet! Over a year after the release! The 12 excellent songs on this cd never get old, no matter how many times you listen to them. Shirley Manson is one of the best, if not THE BEST, artists out there today. As far as it being one of the best albums ever i agree! Its right up there with my other favorites: Hole ""Live Through This"", Rage Against the Machine ""Evil Empire"", Live ""Throwing Copper"", Smashing Pumpkins ""Siamese Dream"", Beastie Boys ""Paul's Boutique"", Pearl Jam ""Ten"", and, of course, Garbage's Selftitled Debut album!!!"
2,Deliciously disturbing ....Highly Underestimated,"FINALLY it comes out on dvd. This film is absolutely brilliant. Psychologically scarred me as a kid. I've never been able to think of ventriloquists or their wooden counterparts in quite the same way since. Still, it has left a lasting , unavoidable impression upon me. I have both dreaded and longed to see it again. Thank you, Dark Sky , for making that possible."
1,measure of a man=1 star......clay aiken=5 stars and more!,"Clay has an amazing voice! and I voted for him on AI, but this album just doesn't makes him justice, yeah this songs, well some of them have meanning and thats great but the beat and just the flow of the album is way too slow(and I love ballads and slow stuff also fast stuff) and this kind of pop music trying to be contemporary is just not for him, he is a true sing a true artist and he has an amazing beautiful voice, but this album is just not for him, maybe 'Invisible"" I think it's the only one that kinda makes him jsutice but the rest no, sorry Clay I'm sure you'll make it huge with ur next album."
2,My favorite Kerouac,"If you are of a certain age and experience, you already know about Dharma Bums.If you are of another certain age and experience, this book goes against everything taught by Saint Ronald Reagan, and so you should avoid it.If you are young, give this book a try. Better yet, instead of buying it, go to the local library to read it. Unless the people I described in my second paragraph have taken over and there are only Approved Books in the library...if there are libraries at all. Libraries cost money, and that means (shudder) taxes.For everyone else: this is Kerouak's best work."
2,I bought my wife a Cadillac,"This bike is well built, with top grade components. You get bang for your money. I ended up buying two of them, one for the wife and one for the daughter who rides with us quite a bit. They both love their bikes. it was simple to assemble, although I did have a very experineced cycler helping me. The ride is smooth and the gears work like a dream. It is a bit on the heavy side perhaps but for my two ladies, it will be all they need for some time until their skill level truly expands."
2,Great Read,"I am currently still reading this book. I'm having a great time reading it and I love how every scene is so perfectly described and full of details.It's one of those books that you have to stop reading now and then, so that you can let your imagination fly and Imagine how would you survive in such conditions and time period.Simply fantastic."
1,Transformers - AGAIN?,This film truly shows how filmmakers attempt to ride success. This movie is really bad. Even with some new blood (or should I say blonde) I couldn't hardly stand to finish the whole thing. But I did. What a waste.
2,Searched for this song...,"Heard the song on Charlie's Angels movie and it wasn't listed on the soundtrack. Did some research and finally found the song. Love the ""dance"" music beat!"
1,We are the Stooges!,"The packaging is so deceiving! I had to have this set. Glad i only paid 10 bucks with ship. i'll be very happy to sell it, break even and get somebody else peeved off at me for selling them JUNK!Usually I read comments/reviews section. this time i failed to do so and i got burned. Caveat emptor! boys and girls. Read the reviews before you buy."
2,Where we're coming from,"This is a book that tells a story i always thought must be there, but no one ever talked about. This is the other side of the Religious Culture Wars that we've heard so much about in the last years -- but this is the history of the side that has not claimed its length and depth. Find out where liberal religions have come from. Read this book."
1,Worthless Edition.,"Without Stephen Gammell's artwork, these are pretty close to worthless.Why would they EVER replace the original, incredible artwork? The reality is, Harper Collins, that Stephen Gammell's artwork MADE these classics.The artwork now is unoriginal, not the least bit frightening (or artful), and does nothing to complement the stories.Huge mistake. Someone should be fired. At least five people should be fired... and blacklisted.This is an atrocity.Prospective buyers: go buy the other versions! Oh, that's right, they're extremely expensive. I wonder why, Harper Collins? You fools.And again for good measure: you fools."
1,Again????,"How many times have they release the same 10 songs? I used to really like Styx and I even enjoyed parts of their last two albums (um... let me be clear here... the last two albums that weren't live albums or compilations or Styx-as-cover-band-garbage.) I actually ""stalk"" this band waiting for them to put out some more music, and I get my hopes up every time there is something new, but 99% of the time they've just released old songs AGAIN. I don't know who is buying these same songs AGAIN, but will you please quit so they'll actually have to put out some new music to make any money?"
2,Nelly SweatSuit Review,I love this cd. I liked Sweat & Suit. And I really love SweatSuit. I especially love the 3 new bonus tracks. Grillz is my favorite one.
1,100 years of tortured reading,I am an avid reader and always have been pleased with Oprah's picks. This book however was painful to get through and I was so disappointed that I finally put it away for good. This is the first book I can honestly say I have never finished nor would ever like to. I have read other books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez but I certainly do not see this one as his best work! What a sleeper!
1,DONT EVER BUY THIS SHIRT,The shirt is NOT at all of a good quality. It does not worth $6 at all. Its transparent also. Please save your money and buy a better quality shirt.
1,Not worth the hassle,"I got this toy a few weeks ago... I had read all the customer reviews and was totally looking forward to this for my son who is almost 3. First, the small tents on the side, never set up... They just would not untwist, and when they were sort of in position, just touching them made them collapse. The larger tent was really fun for about half an hour. But after this short amount of time you could see that this toy was not going to last. Seams started ripping and the basketball hoop almost came off completly. Then it cost me $36.00 to return a $64.00 product (shipping from Canada is not free). I was very disappointed."
2,Conjurer of Reality and Fantasy,"Gompertz's uproarious tale of a Messiah in our midst is original, witty, and yet inducing serious thought. It is at once cynical and pious, down to earth and wholly implausible. With tongue in cheek, Gompertz can be tender and sardonic, mocking and sincere. His dialogue flows naturally, and he obviously knows the ins and outs of TV show business. It should make a good stage or teleplay."
1,12 hour relief?!,"We started off with the Pampers Swaddlers, and I bought these ones by mistake. Since I had them, and the reviews were quite good, I decided to keep them. They claim to have an 'ultra absorb core for outstanding leakage protection', but my baby is 10 lbs (size 1 is for 8-14lbs), and after about 5 hours, she had actually leaked through and out onto her outfit! Not just a bit, but palpably and visibly wet! I would pay the extra money and buy the Swaddlers, which is what I have done."
1,What a shameful letdown,"Shameful attempt at a hybrid of horror, action and suspends that cast Keanu Reeves as occult detective John Constantine in an adaptation of the vertigo comic book that loses it's edge and goes for the gusto in flat out stupidly with a boring acting turn by Keanu Reeves who just does not come across well in the role. The story just makes no sense at all and feels like it needed a good rewrite for everything to truly come together and the direction just does help move things along. Other than the great scene in which Rachel Weisz get torn out of a building, most of the special effects are not very good and could have been improved during post production. As for the rest of the actors, only Rachel Weisz manages to give a compelling performance despite the bad script in which she had to work with and Peter Stormare does a great five minute walk on as prince of darkness. Nether of them however can save this runaway train that should have been checked before it left the tracks."
2,This book is a TREAT!,"It has been a few years since I read Charms for the Easy Life, but when I saw there were no reviews I had to leave one. The main characters in this book are three generations of Southern women. They are strong-willed, very intelligent women and they will make you laugh and cry. Writing this review makes me want to go find the book and re-read it"
2,beautiful,"I love this pendant. My only complaint was that the stone needs to be polished but, other than that, it's perfect. The design really stands out and I get compliments on it often. :)"
1,Kindle version - lost formatting,"Once again, the free kindle version is a disappointment. Both the formatting and the illustrations have been lost. In my opinion, the charm of a book like this is often in the accompanying illustrations. It would be better to buy a complete version than download this one."
2,"""Measure of a Man"" MEASURE UP FOR ME!","I received this album and have thoroughly enjoyed listening to it. The lyrics have romantic depth and an edgy, catchy beat.Each time I listen it seems I notice something new to appreciate.Just as I think ""The Way"" is the best song...another has me reconsidering. This has happened so often that I no longer try to choose.They all do it for me for a different reason. No need to skip over any of these songs!I am off to order another for the Car! GREAT ALBUM!"
2,Lovely ghosts,"Kozinsky's interpretation of Reger's op. 57 is rather controlled; the double fugue glides without shakes, the organ seems to favour it spreading out an uniform sound mantle; if you are fond of this work, and wait for the wise ""slowdowns"" before theme's repeats, as Wheinberger or Germani did, you'll be disappointed. Moreover Bach's BWV 562, in comparison with so much discography, does not present surprises of great importance. The listener thinks: another organist philologist? Till Karg Elert's spirit on the one hand, on the other Karl Richter appear suddenly to Kozinsky on track n5: it's only possible this way to explain an incredible, rhapsodical, furious interpretation of a real masterpiece, whose I don't know different recordings. Only this one merits more than five stars; but never I saw before someone to face a program so deadly for an anthological CD. Thank's to GM Records.Roberto Ranieri"
2,My boys love it!,"I was not so excited about the price but the good reviews on Amazon convinced me to purchase it for my boys. They are 1 and 2. They love it! This set is HUGE. Make sure you have space in your home for something like this. We put it between our two sofas in the living room for now. We plan to move it to their playroom as soon as we do some rearranging in there. The boys have knocked it down playing rough inside the hut. It just pops right back. The setup was super easy. If you don't have a room big enough for the entire play hut then it can easily be setup into two smaller units that are still fun. Great buy. I wished I would have discovered this sooner. This would have really helped out during our snow days and just really cold days when we just didn't leave the house. Also, I plan to take some parts of this unit when we travel this summer."
2,The best rock cd,"This is just flat out the best rock cd ive ever heard. The best drummer ever, he even enspired me to play the drums. Really good guatarits. This gruop is really heavy and there drummer rocks, for example listen to the begining of needles. Don't double think about buying it, just do it. you wont be sorry trust me"
1,A disgrace to the name Hellblazer.,"Dumb down adaptation to the great vertigo horror comic book lacks the flare and the heart of the book and dumbs down the subject matter in order to please Keanu Reeves's fan base. Keanu can't act if his life depended on it and the script is not worth its weight of tissue paper. The acting by most of the cast is almost as bad as Keanu's with the excerption of Rachel Weisz, who gives the only real and compelling performance in the entire movie and to Djimon Hounsou, who is the only actor in the film who does his comic book character justice. Other than their performances, the movie is not worth your time."
2,FANTASTIC!,"This book is exactly what I was looking for. It is well-written, clear, comprehensive, interesting, and very insightful. I learned more from this one book than from two months worth of newspapers, magazines and TV news programs. I give it my highest recommendation, and encourage every American to buy it!"
1,Not his best effort,Max must have had a dictionary by his side while writing this bunch of hog wash. I read to be drawn into a story and it did not happen.
1,Please try another Hot Boy album...,"Guerriula Warfare is an album I fell is something, and that something is everything. The lyrics are most of the time meanless and pointless. Also the beat and backround music of the songs sometimes don't even fit could for the lyrics or how the rapper is rapping. Overall please go out and get another Hotboy album or something. Or just another album in the lines of Cash Money, just please not this one..."
2,What a guy!,"Mr. Franklin was one of a kind. His take on life is so unique that it forces us to understand why we do not have anyone like him today. Brilliant, creative, passionate, and critical, he writes about himself with almost a 3rd person view. It is a much delightful read and one good enough to make a gift out of it. The cost of it on Kindle is hard to resist and Franklin would like that too. Of course, had he been living now with his genius, it would have been called the ""Franklin"" not Kindle."
2,"Witty, clever and a great romantic Regency!","Enochs books are not quite the depth of character as a Stephanie Lauren or Gaelen Foley - more light hearted and fun. Still this was a good read and kept my interest throughout with lots of great dialog and enough romance to keep a romantic like myself interested. Rafe was the perfect hero, a rake with a heart. And maybe not so much a rake as a man who truly needed a home and a purpose in life. Felicity gave him both - a reason to reform and a wonderful woman to love. You will not be disappointed in this book."
1,Another monotonous drone,I've tried to get into this artist but I cannot. I would rather listen to 20 hours of someone's fingernails on a chalkboard than what passes for Bjork's voice. Avoid unless you like to hear your dog howl.
1,"Well, it's Asimov","This book has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding storytelling style and pace. Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation. If you are seriously into science fiction, then by all means read the entire Foundation series: it has historical importance and there is enjoyment to be had there. But I hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book."
1,Defective edition,"I've enjoyed reading this edition for its critical essays and helpful footnotes, but the copy I ordered from Amazon was missing thirty pages. (It turns out that pages 14 through 44 are printed twice, resuming at page 77). They may have corrected the problem in other copies, but don't assume that you'll get the whole book!"
2,born and raised in britain,"This was very entertaining and I enjoyed it. I was a little disappointed that more time was not spent in my own part of the country, Co. Durham."
1,Not even one star to be honest,"This is just an album full of oversung sappy, cheesy lyrics. Horrible production from the AI machine. Where do they find these songwriters?And could Clay over enunciate a little more?Yes, he won't sing about sex, but he's singing about being invisible and watching someone in their room. <@@> Scary!"
1,The conclusion should have been happy instead of terrible.,John Steinbeck uses too many cuss words in this book. I think George should have watched Lennie more so he wouldn't get into so much trouble all of the time. This book isn't really worth reading if you have a choice. It's too short and the conclusion doesn't make much sense.
2,excellent resource,I am fortunate enough to have Lake Douglas as an instructor. He has forgotten more about landscape architecture than most people will ever know. I love going to his class because he has a genuine passion for the subject and almost limitless knowledge. Buy this book. You won't be disappointed.
1,Inner pot peels off!!,"I fell for these great reviews, but found out there is really nothing special about this rice cooker except for the price and the reviews to justify spending more for the same thing.After a couple of months of use, the inner pan peels off, had bad scratches. Talk about the worst customer service.I wish someone I've read a more truthful review on this product prior to buying.Save your money."
2,Another great book in the series,My 10 year old son has enjoyed all the books in the Harriet the Spy series.
1,COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"I simply cannot believe that I paid $30 bucks for this thing. It does absolutely NOTHING, except make a few electronic noises. I kept poring over the instructions, certain that I'd missed something......but I hadn't!! BORING. I think that even my 7-year-old son, who wanted this thing, was disappointed. And don't even talk about the batteries...to add insult to injury, this thing takes button cells, which aren't cheap. Save your $$ for something better.DYB"
2,Such a fun book! Please bring it back in print.,"My three sons were all delighted by this book when they were toddlers and preschoolers. It is so much fun to read together, with the young child laughing as they turn the page and discover where the movable spider has hidden (for example, they lift the flap of the toilet lid and there's the spider with the words, ""Silly Spider, what are you doing there!?!"").I wish that they would bring this book back into print. Because it was one of our favorites, I had wanted to give a copy as a gift to my friends and nieces for their own children. But it's not available :-( Please bring Silly Spider back so that more young children can enjoy his silly adventures."
2,Great Product,The Tivo adapter is so easy. All you have to do is open the package and plug it into your tivo and your ready to go (just make sure you change your tivo settings). Great product
2,Know your history!,"This is a great series for any Christian who would like to know more about the church. Schaff is an amazing writer giving us a theological and philosophical look at sound church history. This book will give the engaged reader sound and intelligent insight not only to know church hisory, but more importantly, a sense of its meaning and beauty."
1,"Lackluster, Uninformative DVD","The presentation and content of this video leaves a lot to be desired. The visual aides, diagrams, etc. are not professionally done nor are they referred to in a clear manner. The video is frankly quite boring.Search for another Lamaze video, you'll find that there is another that offers a lot more detail with a much more exciting and engaging presentation."
1,Fleetwood Mac Rumours,"If you want to hear music, don't purchase this video. Each song is quickly interrupted with current interviews of band members talking mostly of their failed romantic relationships during the recording of Rumours. This should be labeled a documentary, not a music video. The band members do talk about the music, and there are nice clips shot at Sausalito, California's Record Plant showing how particular tracks were mixed. However, I believe using the Rumours album cover on the video packaging deceptively implies that it is a music video."
2,No Diaper Rash!,"With the coming of my twins, I had to save as much as I can. So I used cheaper diapers...but soon even with putting generous amount of diaper rash cream every change, diaper rash came in red, raw pimple-like bumps and even bleed. I decided to change and use pampers and was amazed at how quick the rash was gone. Pampers diaper is lightweight and breathable. Very good for the nite especially if the baby can sleep through. Won't leak."
1,"Fun toy, but piece of Junk!","My son was so in love with this toy, but he would get so frustrated playing with it because it falls apart. I do not recommend this toy. It is a waste of money."
1,"A Bad, Bad Machine","I purchased one of these players from Discount Jungle, and would not recommend you do so, too. After the first three test cassettes the machine would not load any more tapes, so back it went. The company was apologetic and sent another shipment right away, but I have my suspicions it was a different player at all, as this one would not load a single tape. In all, I've lost a month of VHS use and am out nearly the cost of the product itself in return shipping charges, not to mention the inconvenience of repackaging and taking time out of my life to do the return. Do you have that kind of time and money?"
2,A Pampers Household,We love Pampers. They are all we use in our house. I can trust that they will make it through long nights and keep my baby from getting diaper rashes. Love them!
2,"I was skeptical, but they work!","I have a new miniature dachshund puppy who is 7 weeks old. Before I brought her home I went to the local Petco the pick up some puppy pads, which are a foreign idea to me, having housetrained previous dogs on newspapers when I was growing up. However, I thought I would give them a shot. Of course there were about 5 or 6 brands to choose from, but I liked the idea that in theory these are extra special because of the ""just-cut grass"" smell they add. Well, I brought them home with low expectations, and I am not saying that she doesn't still have accidents, but I am amazed at how well she is responding to them! Maybe 75% of the time she seeks out the puppy pad on her own accord and uses it. I am about to run out; so I might buy regular pads and see if there is a difference. Overall, I would say they are worth a try, especially since they are only slightly more expensive. Good luck!"
1,"Lord, have mercy!","If this movie were worse (and if it COULD be) there would undoubtedly be an unhealthy number of premature deaths .... First of all, there's Poseidon. This CG bill shut is an outrage to humanity. His rolling waveface accompanied by Assanti's pitiful attempt to weep provides an outstanding performance which may (being optimistic) top the emotion found in a dramatic episode of Mr. Rogers. I am certain that if poor old (really old) Homer were given a second life to live in this century, he would probably waste it by inflicting himself with chimera. With all due respect, though none is due, this film is pathetic. That's all I have to say. Just DON'T watch this movie before (or even after) you read the book, unless you wish to perish at an unnaturally early stage in life!!!!!!!!GOODBYE!!!!!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this in hopes of (like everyone else) having something that would warm a cold bottle in the car fairly quickly. This is NOT the product for the job! It takes forever, and actually makes the bottle too hot to handle without warming the milk much at all. The outside of the warmer gets way hot, too. Definitely a danger to you and children to touch. Luckily I have not had the problem some others have had with it melting my bottle, but I am not going to use it again to risk that!! In fact, I think the company needs to be notified so they will recall this product before someone gets hurt!!"
1,"Informative of media tactics, but not statistically accurate","It's a cute book, although utterly misleading. The Atlantic wrote: ""A pleasantly subversive little book, guaranteed to undermine your faith in the almighty statistic.""The fact of the matter is that when proper, statistically sound data gathering and analysis methods are employed, the statistics not only do not lie, but they also reveal the nature and extent of the errors inherent in the results.I know - among other things, I'm a professsional statistician.In fact, it was my profession in statistics that steered me into network analysis, which is a statistician's dream world. Large corporations must figure out where the bottlenecks reside, and how to combat them in the most cost-effective, time-valued, long-term manner.To do this properly, it takes an individual who knows Finance, Statistics, and Networks.Bottom lie: Statistics themselves don't lie. However, the improper use of statistics can lead to erroneous conclusions."
2,Yummy and healthy - great salt sub in wet dishes,"My hubbie wanted this since he read about it's health benefits (we all need amino acids!). We have found that it is really yummy - a great salt substitute (kindof tastes like soy sauce, and is pretty salty tasing - though not actually high in salt). We even use it as salad dressing and veggie dressing, in addition to in stir fry and other (roasts, casseroles)."
2,Good Fit & Function,"The cover fits reasonably well, with only slight shifting. It does not obstruct any of the controls, display, the mouthpiece or the earpiece. I really like the clip on the back. I'm pretty satisfied overall."
2,Cool!,"When Claudia baby sits for the Rodowsky family, She and Shea become friends. they are both not good at spelling. they help each other in spelling. Nut stacey almost ruins Claudia and Stacey's friendship."
2,I'm hooked and I want some more ...,"I've only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series, but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers: Ash is my favourite male character!!! Did anyone notice that (so far) only Ash and Mary-Lynnette tried to fight their attraction? But why was it called ""Daughters of Darkness"" when Rowan, Kestrel and Jade weren't actually the main characters?P.S. I think L. J. Smith should let more characters become vampires. And how come all the main-character vampires are all male and the witches female???"
1,A Prosaic Sleepy Season,"David Moody has written a hyper-realistic apocalyptic zombie survival thriller - not simply a knock off text of popular zombie movies, but a strongly character driven book.Three Characters who are so obtuse and dull, and written in the same first person voice as to be indistinguishable from either each other or the 3rd party intermittent narrator.Virtually nothing happens in this book - sure most of humanity is wiped out, and eventually rises in mass - but readers know how that goes; getting a hyper realistic look into the psyche of three nearly identical characters isn't that interesting - and certainly doesn't warrant 200 pages.Maybe as an American reader I expect more from both my zombie thriller and its protagonists, than several trips to the grocery store, lots of soup being consumed, and one brief chapter of massed zombies at the barricades."
1,Don't rely on it...,"This long-awaited follow up to the 4.5 Resource Kit has been a great disappointment. (Don't take my word for it - go look at the comments in the SBS2000 newsgroup)I'm not into denigrating other people's work, but this book really doesn't have any plus points.To be brief: - it fails to explain essential concepts, with each chapter having hardly any logical connection with those preceding it - the text is peppered with terms and acronyms which go undefined - there are few graphic examples or practical walkthroughs - what walkthroughs there are (e.g. for setup wizards) do little beyond provide hard copy screenshots of the SBS dialog boxes - the graphic layout is poor - oversized headlines made me suspect that, in the absence of decent text, the editor resorted to padding out the book.I felt as if whoever did edit the book had no knowledge of network computing, never mind SBS.Sorry, but this is a lemon."
1,Missing parts,I concur with previous reviews. Unacceptable copy as it is mising passages - as mentioned before - which creates the most confusion from the very start. Should be removed from the Amazon catalog as it is unbecoming of this vendor. SAVE YOUR TIME. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT.
2,A OK ~ Three's Company Season 1,"I'm glad Three's Company was put on DVD. It was a good show back in its days and it is still a good show. I can't wait to buy the Second Season when it comes out in the spring of 2004. If you have never seen any of the shows, I suggest you start watching and own this DVD. You won't stop laughing."
2,Does what it says without anything more,I needed a thermometer for outside and this does just what it says. I wish it was a bit bigger but so did I when I was 5.
2,Ryan's Daughter,"I loved the movie 40 years ago and I love it just as much now. A recent trip to Ireland made it even more moving. The openingscene of the Cliffs of Moher was just as beautiful as when I saw it on my trip. Much of the dialog about the ""troubles"" in Ireland went over my head when I saw the movie as a young women, hovever they made a real an impression this time. Christopher Jones is still great to look at. Recommend it highly."
2,Awsome!!,Really a life saver when it comes to go to a nice party and try to look spectacular especially for me that i give birth 7 months ago and i'm still try to work out the few pounds and belly i have left from that :) really i recomended. Money well spend it
1,What went wrong here?,"Sadly, Gus Van Sant has stopped directing movies. Instead he has become a supervisor of filming. In the DVD supplemental documentary, the cast goes on and on about how wonderful it was to get to be so creative and work without a script. They rave about how much they loved the improvisation and about how great it was that they were CREATING a work of art. In the end, they didn't create anything but a nauseating bore.I turned the subtitles on just so I could understand what ""Blake"" was muttering (it wasn't worth reading so I turned them back off). The film tries to offer insight into the Kurt Cobain like character but I fail to see how watching him make Macaroni and cheese or crawl around on the floor for five minutes or mumble unitelligable monologues offers an audience anything. GET OVER YOURSELF GUS and start making real films again instead of trying to pass this garbage off as 'ART"""
1,I don't do novels and this is why. . .,"This author knew very little about ancient Egypt, it's people and it's history - and didn't bother to learn.A wast of time."
1,A Military History,"This may be a good book on military history. I am not a military historian, so I cannot attest to how sound Markham's research into that subject is. Just know what you are buying. There is almost nothing here about Napoleon as a person, not compared to most other biographies. And the social context which gave rise to Napoleon is not really explored here. I find the first two chapters of the book that deal with Napoleon's genealogy and his early years interesting and well-written. After that the book got too dense and the writing style rather pedestrian. Everything beyond the first chapter of the book is written for a specialist (a scholar who focuses on the 19th century or on military history). At the time of the publication the book received such glowing reviews that I cannot help but wonder what I missed here."
1,Very good quality,"I was pleased with the quality of the pet stroller. It even has places for your water bottle, cell phone, purchases (bottom tray). Rec'd in perfect condition, and delivery time was quick."
1,Moonstike,"I received Moonsturck and The Seven Year Itch for Chritsmas ordered from Amazon. I love this movie and was excited to see it on blueray. When I played it you get as far as the 20th Century announcement and then a message comes up that if you have any problems viewing the bluray go to .... then the screen stays black. Going to the suggested website was not helpful. My niece sent it back to Amazon who was quick to send a replacement. Sadly, the replacement is doing the same thing. I have no problems watching other blurays nor The Seven Year Itch (ordered from Amazon at the same time and looks and sounds great). I don't know if both blurays came from the same manufacturer. She will be contacting Amazon about it, since they won't speak with me because I didn't order it. If you take a chance on this product open it carefully because you may have to return it."
2,THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!,"I don't know anyone who did not enjoy this book. It is definetly the greatest book I ever read. It deals with themes like hope, poverty, finding your faith, pride, family issues, patriotism, political issues, and growing up. I was hooked on the first page, it may be 425 pages long, but it felt like 90! I read the book so fast, and I couldn't put it down!!! After reading the last page, I just held onto the book. The story was so moving and it's unforgettable. I'm gonna require all my children to read it."
2,Great device; no more landline telephone!,"Purchased this device to complete the elimination of our landline telephone. It did exactly as promised, with the added benefit of renting movies online; no more late night trips to the ""Red Box""."
1,Painful,"I wouldn't recommend this book to an enemy. True, the information may be worthy, but the writing style and the narration were horrible. It is definitely NOT written (nor read) in a conversational manner. I'm willing to cut the narrator some slack as he was only reading what was written, however better inflection, phrasing, pauses, etc... would have greatly helped this otherwise tedious book.I couldn't even finish it. I suffered through the first 5 disks and after all that investment in time I couldn't bring myself to listen to the 6th. Its just that poorly written.I'll restate the fact that the message -- the information -- is worth hearing, its simply written in such a tedious manner that I couldn't stand to hear it through the end.I think I'll donate it to my local library."
2,"Yes, they are waterproof!","My work takes me out in bad weather frequently, and I really need a boot that will keep my feet dry. I have suffered through 3 different pairs of ""waterproof"" boots that gave me no protection--you get what you pay for, I guess. Someone suggested I order from L. L. Bean, and I was getting ready to fork up the dough, when I saw these in an e-mail from Amazon. They are not fancy, but they ARE waterproof! And, after an initial breaking-in period, they are quite comfortable. I am thoroughly satisfied with these boots."
2,This is a great cd!,"This is a great cd if you loved the music in the game. It seems to cover songs from the begining of the game to the very end. It has ocarina songs, main themes, store songs and more. I've had the cd a week and I love it. Overall this is a great cd and I recomend this if you love the music in the game."
2,Science fun!,A great little tool for seeing the normally unseen. Scope easily focuses by tilting the scope rather than fiddling with adjustment knobs. It's so fun to see things really close up!
1,The production crew done her wrong...,"I would like to blame the director, but, didn't she preview her own material?Whatever it is that would account for the awful audio -- the sound mixing, or Ms. Corn's strident, almost lecturing tone as she reads her voice-over script -- I found it remarkably annoying and distracting. Also, the sequencing is not unique enough to get lost in the practice, so to speak. I really wanted to like this DVD; Ms. Corn has lovely form and provides a good demonstration of the standard poses, but there is nothing novel enough about the two practices to justify keeping this DVD in my collection when I find myself slipping into grit-my-teeth-asana as I try to concentrate on the music, which can barely be detected behind the grating narration. A big disappointment."
1,Avoid this product.,"A man should not smell like an entire bottle of cologne when he gets out of the shower, nor should the entire house he lives in smell like a giant vat of cologne. Go buy a bottle of nondescript body wash and after your shower apply a few squirts of the cologne of your choice. But really, why would you need cologne if you're just going to the office?! You don't! Please make it stop!"
2,A Classic picture of African-American History,"Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, Lena Horne, Cab Calloway, and Fats Waller. That line up alone is a historic line-up. This was a major accomplishment to bring this cast together in 1943. A treat for the whole family."
1,Into the Wilderness It's NOT,"I picked up Into the Wilderness by accident and thought it was one of the best books I'd read. I counted the days til Dawn on a Distant Shore was released but found it to be, at best, disappointing. Truth be told, I found the story farfetched, the characters(who seemed so alive in Into the Wilderness) flat and, in some instances, just plain unlikeable, and the sea voyage boring. Absolutely nothing in this book caught my interest . . . strange, because I found the first book captivating both in terms of the developing storyline between Elizabeth and Nathanial and the book's historical context. I still look forward to the next installment, primarily because it's set back in Hidden Wolf where this story belongs, but I won't be counting the days until its release and I won't invest in a hardback edition."
2,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,This book was in very good condition and I received it in a very timely manner.
2,LOVE IT!,"I just got this from a local Stop and Shop and LOVE it! It leaves my hair so soft, smelling good and you can't even tell that I have any product in my hair. I'm reading a lot of reviews where people are saying that they can't find it anywhere. Depending on where you live, try your local grocery store!"
1,Disappointing read,"I was expecting a consistent story or at least an engaging narrative that takes fantastical twists. Instead, so many characters are introduced (many have the same name) making it very difficult to care about any of them. Also, the struggles between the rebels and whoever it is they are fighting (and why, come to think of it) are vague and uninteresting. I can't imagine what about this book is so transfixing to so many people. Count me out, I guess."
2,EWAN MCGREGOR FANS,"I ENJOYED THE BOOK A LOT, BEING A MCGREGOR FAN MYSELF,BUT I WOULD PREFER THAT IT HAD MORE INFO ON HIM AND NOT AS MUCH ON HIS FILMS AND THE PEOPLE IN THEM. OVER ALL, THE BOOK WAS GOOD AND HAD A LOT OF INTERESTING FACTS IN IT AND ANY EWAN MCGREGOR FAN WOULD AGREE WITH ME THAT HE IS PRETTY HOT IN THE COLOR PICTURES IN THE BOOK!"
2,Easy to setup and comfortable,"I got this for guests to use in our small spare room. Inflating it was quick and easy since it has a built-in pump: you plug it in, turn it on and switch off when it's inflated enough for you. The only drawback is that the pump is really noisy - about the same as a loud vacuum cleaner - so you probably want to inflate the mattress before the rest of the household goes to bed.I had one guest a week, two weeks in a row, sleeping on it for several nights. Both found it comfortable and slept well on it. The extra height makes it feel more like a regular bed and less like you're camping out on someone's floor.Like all air mattresses, the air sucks heat from the body so the sleeper can get really cold; I've found the best way around this is to place a blanket or comforter on the mattress before you put the sheets on - this bottom blanket will insulate the person from the cold air.So far it's been great and I have no complaints."
2,Growing Up Elsewhere,"A former ""diplobrat"" who grew up abroad, I identified with Godden's description of a child's first encounter with France. The effect of their foreign adventure on each family member develops along with an excellent plot (not usually Godden's strong point). Even better than the character descriptions is the evocation of French country life at its most seductive -- ""next best to being there."""
1,really cute magnets but...,horrible set of grinders. these handles broke before i had the chance to refill them! waste of money.
1,Exhausting,"This book has it's place--and that place is in an American Literature course at a university. It was entirely too technical to be enjoyable. I was assigned this book as a ninth grader and now that I am a teacher and understand lexile levels, I must advise other teachers not to assign this book until the later grades--and only to the highest students."
2,"It's very nice story, but a little difficult to me",It was interesting to me to know about the soldiers'experiences before going to war. Also it was nice to see how different could be the points of view of each person in the same situation. It was pretty sad for me to see how their life changed after that experience.
2,Good,"smallville is one of my favorite shows, so i can't say nothing negative about it.. at least of the top of my head lol. the product came onetime, if i remember correctly i think i did the one-day delivery.. so that was good."
1,not exactly all that deep or intricate,"well, it's kind of hippy, hoppy, someone learned to play the slide, and i suppose there are some beats on it, but man, it sure is a great big disappointment--this music is not challenging or interesting or even all that different. if you just want something that will go in the background or maybe while you're chemically enhanced, this will do as well as a doors record or something else, but it is not worth any hype at all. it's like low rent version of Arnold or maybe Gomez. they obviously think that they are very cool though. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... hubris......"
2,Diapers,Pampers Baby Dry Size 4 Diapers Economy Pack Plus 192 CountI received my product on time and in perfect condition. I have ordered with Amazon 5 times now and each and every time was awesome. The company the diapers are coming from is Warehouse deals and they have done a great job. The product is in great condition and they have awesome prices. Thank you Lisa
2,Reflections of a Vampire ROCKS!,"Horror lovers everywhere, be prepared to crown another King. Damion Kirk is a master story weaver and first class writer with tremendous style. Mr. Kirk's vampires are so vivid, they crawl off the page. One even followed me into my dreams! St. Laurue is a vampire that shocks as much with his violence as his sudden outbursts of mercy.That Mr. Kirk has created such memorable characters is wonderful, that they share such a rich story is incredible. Reflections of a Vampire entices us on a wild romp from the back alleys and clubs of NYC, to the Holocaust Museum in DC.I'll put it this way - If you're looking for a great read; if you love horror, mystery or suspense -- buy one for yourself, and one for your best friend - so they don't keep yours. Why did I love Reflections of a Vampire? Because it's a tale so very, very human."
1,Short axe,Good quality but not manly. Seems to be the length for a teenager. If looking for a small axe it is fine. If looking for a man's axe look elsewhere.
2,Best Diapers For Our Kids,"I realize that not every child is the same. Some may have allergic reactions to some brands or some brands may hold in leaks better. I have three children aging from 2 months to 4 years and they all use Pampers. We have tried other store brands and name brands, but they either leaked, caused a rash or just fell apart after use and wouldn't stay on. Pampers seems to stay on well, even on my active children who jump and roll off of everything and run all over. My four year old only wears diapers at night (as does my 2 year old recently) and they hold whatever both of them can throw at 'em, and some mornings, its completely full. But no leaks! Great diapers and the larger pack is the best for the money. I would recommend them anytime over any brand."
1,Poor reliability,"I have had several of these monitors. I use a two-monitor set-up.-The backlight on the first burned out one month out of warrantee. ViewSonic would not replace the first monitor- fair enough as it was out of warrantee. I purchased a replacement. When it came, the screen was blue, and the color could not be adjusted. ViewSonic sent a replacement which had a green screen, and again, the color could not be adjusted. They were unable to find another VA912b, so they sent a different model to replace it.-Meanwhile, my second monitor, again a VA912b burned out the backlight after less than six months of use.-Beware that the glowing reviews you see for this monitor may not take into account its poor reliability. Should you choose this monitor, be sure to get an extended warrantee! Better yet, do yourself a favor and choose another model or manufacturer."
1,"Fine, if you're that way inclined","Pretty easy to read, but a load of tosh, drivel,whatever you call it. I see the comparisons with Rushdie here. If you're into this sort of writing then fine. Read Rabelais instead, at least you get a bit of a chuckle."
1,Pretty Toney,Unfortunately or on Purpose!!! this album was released 2 weeks ago on the Net...and I had a chance to preview it - there a handful of solid tracks but as a referral the better album is Pretty Toney - The B-Sides...every track is a hit...I dont know why Def Jam did not want to buy those songs the lyrics and production are amazing...peace.
2,The Best Way to Run!!!,"This is a wonderful book. The technique of using your Chi energy to help you run better, longer, and free from injury really works. I have just used it while I trained for my 1st marathon and I feel great! You have to give it a read"
1,Too unrocking for my taste but it's alright,"Queen's ""Hot space"" is very different from the classic and excellent albums from the 1970's. The overall approach is more pop than rock. The opening ""Staying power"" is pop-disco with a pumping bass and some horns, and is kind of a declaration of what to expect this time from Queen. Regardless of musical style, Queen are so talented that they do it with class and quality whether it's heavy metal or pop. On this album John Deacon's bass plays a major role on the behalf on Bran May's guitar and even if I would prefer a more guitar oriented album, Freddy Mercury sings as good as always. The melody and the groove is usually there and songs like ""Back chat"" are very good indeed. But of course there's a couple of tunes I don't think stand up to former heights. The closing number ""Under pressure"" is a duet with David Bowie and in regard of the other songs on this album it falls kind of natural."
2,One of the best electro records,"My type of electro! Keith Tenniswood of Two Lone Swordsmen fame demonstrates his solo credibility here with his superb debut album.Combining breaks and beats with smooth, simple melodies, Tenniswood brings all that is good about electro music together.What made the songs on here even better are the beautiful electronic, ambient, pulsating and shimmering walls of sound Tenniswood creates behind his songs. Fans of Two Lone Swordsmen will know what I'm talking about, and Tenniswood uses this skill to great effect on this album.An excellent, consistent electro, breakbeat album, with strong hints of electronica and IDM. One of the best electronic albums of the past few years."
1,Lodge Book,For the price of the book I was looking for more recipes not a history of cast iron cooking. Not worth the price
2,MORE THAN LETTERS...,"I admit that I bought this album for the title track alone. After all, had that been the only good track on this CD I still would have felt that it was worth my money.But the title track is just the beginning for this fine country offering by John Michael Montgomery. I found myself listening to and enjoying every track on LETTERS FROM HOME. Montgomery's smoother-than-silk voice is one of the finest in country music today and his straight-forward approach to his music comes through in every note. You won't want to miss this one.THE HORSEMAN"
2,Less expensive here than elsewhere,"I was worried this adapter might be different than the others I have seen on the internet or in stores, because it was about $20 less than what seemed to be the going rate. Have no fear, this is the one that will work with your Tivo.It was easy to hook up - just plug the USB into your Tivo unit and follow the setup instructions (on screen in the Tivo Setup menu); I was up and running in about 5 minutes.Signal strength is a little bit less than what i get with my new laptop - My new laptop gets about 65% signal sitting on my bed, this gets about 53% from the same room. But, it's certainly acceptable for downloading program guides and swapping shows with my other Tivo. With a wireless-g network I can transfer an hour TV show in about 15 minutes, and much faster than real time. If I wait about 30 seconds to start playing after I start transferring, I find that I can FF through all the commercials."
1,Surprisingly Poor Quality,"We use a lot of diapers and frequently go back and forth between Pampers and Huggies as our child grows. Our 18 month-old son definitely wears size 4 but this version of Pampers seems slightly too small. Worse, the stick-on flaps are much less sticky than most diapers we use. Several times his diaper has actually come loose because the flap unsticks during the night resulting in a wet boy. Not sure if this was just a bad batch or there is something different with this particular model. We have not had problems with other Pampers in the past."
2,Nice for the money,"The first one I bought was defective. The DVD didn't work at all. I purchased it from Electronics Express and when I contacted them they were wonderful. They gave me an RMA number right away, Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later. This one is just fine. I really love the clarity of the picture. My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price."
1,Terrible!,"We went from Swaddlers Sensitive to Baby Dry and were so disappointed after less than a week that we gave them away and went back to the Swaddlers. First of all not only did they leak urine (EVERY night woke up soaked) but even during the day when I changed my four month old's diaper after only a couple of hours his skin was very damp. Now he's never had a diaper rash, and all Ive ever used to keep him dry were the swaddler and baby powder but with these diapers I started using desitin just to keep the urine off his skin. They also couldnt hold in his poops. EVERY time he pooped (not exaggerating) it was a complete blow out, down his legs, up the back of his clothes. We NEVER had this problem with the Swaddlers. I also have to agree with the post about them being too thin, feeling recycled and rough against babys skin. The Swaddlers are MUCH better."
2,Pretty good.,"This warmer keeps my coffee warm, but not as warm as I would like. The unit slides away from you as you push at the on-off switch. This annoyance was overcome with some automobile trim mounting tape. 3M Company 1/2X5 Molding Tape 03609Na Automotive Tape A small square of this double-sided foam tape under each foot will hold it in one place on your desk or table. I bought the Mr. Coffee warmer to replace a homemade warmer that was better at keeping the coffee hot, but finally succumbed to old age. That warmer was made by cutting off the top half of an old 4-cup brewer and using the bottom half (warming plate and switch) as a mug warmer."
1,Broken right out of the box,At first the jaw didn't close even after I pushed all the teeth in. After a few tries some of the teeth stuck and will not come back out. Cheaply made- I won't be buying another one.
2,People...,"The Plug-In PET is not coming to America. The season of NT Warrior is already over, Axess is airing now. They would have brought the Plug-In to America before the Adanced PET. It wouldn't make sense to make the Advanced PET while NT Warrior is showing, then make the Plug-In while Axess is.The Plug-In is extremely rare. I have one, don't buy it. The battle system is terrible, and the battery dosn't last that long.Either buy this PET, or buy the Progress. I have both. The Progress is the best out of all..."
1,tbone,thought this was a cd by the group pieces of a dream. you put it with their cds. not what i wanted.
2,Good quality attachment for my Bosch vacuum,"I bought this attachment for my Bosch 2100UC vacuum and it works very nicely on my hardwood floors. It's well made but not too expensive. The only drawback I can see is that has little wheels on the sides that engage the floor when downward pressure is applied. That's probably to keep the attachment from being pushed so low on its bristles that it pushes dirt in front of it, and in fact I can say that the wheels do not affect the suction. However, I am used to hard floor attachments that I can ""float"" along the floor without feeling any hard contact points."
1,Missing Text!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I had begun reading the story from a book and had reached the end of chapter 2. Back at home I loaded the free version on my Kindle and found that not only was the legend of the baskervilles that the client reads to Holmes missing, but the more recent newspaper account as well. Pay the two dollars and get the complete book. Who knows how much else is missing."
1,Worst DVD ever,"The movie is amazing and worth the price. This is one of the best movies of 2005. Disc 1 is the movie, the 2005 MTV movie awards intro spoof and a trailer. Disc 2 is the Worst DVD I have ever seen in my life. The menu system is a series of comic panels that has only one feature per screen and you can't tell what you are looking at with out actually starting the feature, most of the time anyway. I can't watch the Disc, its garbage and torture trying to deal with. Don't (DO NOT) even think about getting this version. I am going to return my copy to get the Batman Begins (Widescreen Edition). I never get the one disc version but I will have that one now. Save your money (even if it's only $5 [if it was a fifty cents I would still tell you to say your money] it's not worth it."
2,In Nomine Patris et Filii,"I love everything on this album. Every song is perfect, the guitars are raw like a rusty chainsaw, and Vikernes sings like he was about to kill someone the second after. Standout tracks: the first song and the 25 mins atmospheric one.If you're a catholic or a believer this is a must.5/5"
2,THE BEST VOICE EVER!!,"This is the best music cd I have ever heard. His voice is the most amazing thing. I find myself comparing everyone that sings to him and he wins hands down. I would recommend this to anyone who followed the american idol 2nd season and heard Clay sing. You will not be disappointed!! In my 40 years, I can easily say, Clay Aiken is the greatest singer ever!!"
2,Nice Book,Its a sad but very good book I think it was writen well. I am yet a middle schooler and like this book you might as well read it now and read it again in high school any way good book.
1,Junk Book :)),"If you are a big fan of industry PR campaigns, then this book is for you!However, if you are a critical thinker that is interested in evidence and facts, this book is Junk.Interesting note: The author is affiliated with organizations that are funded by major industries such as 3M, Chevron, Dow Chemical, etc. He is most likely writing what they are paying him to write (e.g. their point of view)."
2,A Fun Read!,"A quick, light-hearted read that kept my attention from beginning to end. Not the kind of book I usually read, although I'm glad I took the time to give this one a whirl. Definitely good for a few chuckles."
2,Cute book and a fast read,"Absolutely charming book, great for all grade levels. I usually run for the gory, werewolfie or anne boleynesque books, but it was refreshing to pick up something sweet AND interesting for a change. Buy this for the MG reader in your life, but read it for yourself first!"
2,Great CD,"Definitely my favorite band. We saw 4 hits come off this album, and I can't believe they didn't release any more."
2,The Rabbi's Cat is the cat's meow!,This book came highly recommended to me by my Rabbi's husband. I was not disappointed! I think everyone will love this illustrated novel.Jorma
2,ill joint!!!!,"When i bought this album I expected it to be a bangin joint and when I played it....all I can say is that its tight. You gotta check out joints like ""Imagine That"", ""Take It Off"" and ""Fuhgidabowdit"". Other ill joints are ""Farmers"" and ""Hello"" what the heck every song is fresh. This is way better than his previous joint ""Phenomenon"". Get this one, it sure is butta...its great to see the one of tha greatest back in tha game!!!!"
1,i got it cheap and it is Cheap !!!,"I did not like the product, but i got it really cheap . This is not a quality product , avoid at higher prices"
1,It doesnt work with Vista,"The price was excellent but the standard shipping was very slow. It doesn't work with Vista, no drivers, so is useless to me. I gave it to my son and it works fine with Windows XP. My son has used it to scan pictures for me and it is of good quality."
2,Love pampers!,"I have always loved pampers because they are so soft and thin that they seem more comfortable on my baby than any other brand. I have an 18 month old in a size 3, and so far she has had no rashes or night leakage in these. I have used pampers for all 3 of my kids, and now that we are expecting twins I have already stocked up on more pampers swaddlers for a month! Thanks amazon for the amazing prices on diapers!"
2,Excellent book and thought provoking,A neat twist looking at it from the older sister's point of view. She truly believes she loves her sister. Her love like many of our loves is conditional and fear based. It isn't until she is compelled to write her story that the process of self-awareness takes hold and she goes through the myth herself. As she does this her true love for Psyche and all the others including herself grow as well.
1,Ripped less than a year later with minimal use,"I wore these shoes to the gym (powerlifting requires flat soles) no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time. After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped (on the opening, between the toe and heal, inside edge).Guess I'll skip the lo top next time."
1,"Horrified, and not in a good way","To echo the sentiments of other reviewers, the orginal macabre illustrations were what made these books!, My highschool age son can't recall any of the stories but still talks about the ""super creepy"" pictures. Political correctness run amuck is the only explaination for the watering down of the imagery into something bland and banal. I truly hope the publisher reads these reviews if only to realize what a ridiculous decision changing the artwork was."
2,Scared the crap out of me!,I originally saw this movie in 1966 while pregnant with my first child. Not a recommended thing to do. Scared me to death and made me realize what evil is out there. Still just as scary today.
2,great!,"very good book. read it for school, but it was definitely worth it to read it. good story line that kept me interested through all the plot twists"
1,Franklin's Just a Regular Guy. Now Go Read Something Else.,"Sometimes pastiches work well, like Bach's B Minor Mass. Not so this autobiography. Thrown together, arbitrary, sinfully pedestrian, this is one book that you can easily miss in your short life. Franklin shows you he's just a regular guy with regular thought processes. He drifts through life sometimes helping people and sometimes taking advantage of them. He may be an early humanitarian, but he is also an early capitalist, and he knows what he wants. Great, so does Ted Turner, but you don't see us going ape for his life story, do you? Franklin was truly one of our greatest founding fathers, but you won't get a glimmer of that from this book. Reading anybody else's account of Franklin's life would be a much more rewarding experience. Go there if you must do Franklin."
2,I have a different version????,"Love the band, love the album but... I have an album with songs like Sahara and Chains. Where are they on this album? A must have if you love a perfect mixture of Guitar, great vocals, and a keyboard. Great stuff!"
2,A Powerful Story,"Between the haunting characterization and the brilliant story-telling, Steinbeck created a novella that captures the human experience with an eerie certainty. Like Hemingway, the few words used create more power than other authors who can be sometimes accused of over-stating their point."
1,Getting old,"This may be one of the great works of humanity, but it just doesn't cut it for me. The gender sterotypes are nauseating, to say the least. Though required in schools, this book is nnot one of the bests to read on your own time. Or maybe I am just disillussioned."
1,Not authentic,"The title of this video mentions Argentine Tango. Unfortunately, what is being taught on this tape is not authentic Argentine Tango. Not even close. It's ballroom tango. There is a huge difference: in music, style, steps, posture, etc... Don't be fooled by ballroom instructors trying to teach Argentine Tango. The only authentic instruction available on the market comes from authentic Argentine instructors from Buenos Aires."
2,The man who would oppose the Gods.,"Combining his wonderful characters with his subtle senseof humor, Zelazny has created another great work. In Lordof Light, Mahasamatman (drop the Maha- &amp; the -atman and call him Sam) opposes the technologically created Godsbased on the Hindu pantheon. Like an abstract painting, every time you read this book something new is seen, felt,or experienced. This book is another example of why Zelazny one of the greatest sci-fi writers of all time"
2,A Wonderful Shared Experience About Living In A Different Culture,"Bruce Feiler shares his experience as a new teacher in Japan and how he accommodates himself to the culture of Japan and its school system. The book includes many humorous episodes as well as studies in how to adapt to new surroundings and to people who have different behaviors from those of our own. The reader will develop a greater appreciation for the way in which the Japanese education system works at the levels described in the book and in how one must develop a thick skin and a great sense of humor in order to be accepted when traveling or working overseas. The characters in this book are real and are brought to life on paper quite effectively. This is a story of shock, adaptation, and, ultimately, but with a lot of hard work - success."
2,hugely entertaining even after 20 years,Highly enjoyable for parents and kids. Amazing to think this is twenty years old. Fantastic filmaking!A favorite scene is the janitor playing Sorcers Apprentice on a sax and the brooms sweeping up!
2,The Best,As entertaining as it is brilliant!!!! This is a masterful addition to your collection whether your a scientist or a sports hero. This is a work of brilliance you must see!!! Get the book too.
2,Wow,An amazing man who wrote this autobiography in a chatty way to his son. Fascinating and informative about a very intelligent man.
2,"Good, expensive","Good diapers. High price, would use store brand instead. Small babies don't pee that much, so save money and buy cheaper diapers."
2,Enjoyable,"What's to say, really. It's sorta Tarl Cabot meets Jack Ryan. Without the pages of goofy internal dialogue or the Russian order of battle."
2,Good lessons for anyone,"Adolf Von Schell is a combat leader, but his lessons apply to any leadership position. This book is a short read that offers big lessons."
1,Hate widescreen format,"Loved the movie, bought the dvd and its in widescreen, its terrible. My favorite scenes, dance on the bar, all you can see is their middle, not faces and feet at the same time. It's not the same would rather have a TV cut format."
2,Review from the Everett Herald,"Ballooning Book Takes Readers up, up and away!Maybe it was the photograph of the cow jumping over the moon; or several balloons cheek-by-jowl, jockeying for position during competition.Somewhere in George Denniston's ""The Joy of Ballooning"" (Courage Books) it became clear that thrills, cameraderie, humor, creativity and competition are all part of the ballooning experience.Imagine floating over the Snohomish Valley, or trying to be the first to float three miles to snag the keys of a pickup that are attached to a 30-foot-high pole, or taking your wedding vows in a sky-high ceremony.Denniston offers an overview of ballooning, from history and physics to extreme ballooning, special shapes and festivals.Sharon Wootton"
2,Best I've ever read.,"Even though this became one of the best classics in modern literature, it's not really ""classical"" or dated at all. If you like mystery, you will like it. If you like Sci-Fi, you will like it. If you like psychological novels, you will like it. If you like picturesque novels, you will like it. Anyway, you will difinitely like it!!!"
1,"Nice idea, bad quality","I thought this product would really come in handy for camping. But after owning it for just a couple of days, I accidentally tipped it over and that was all it took. The lantern would not work. I sent away for a new bulb, but that did not fix the problem.This is a well thought out product that offers many handy features. Unfortunately, with typical Black and Decker quality, don't expect it to last long or to take even the slightest jarring. It could be a nice emergency item in case of a power blackout, but I would not recommend trying to take it anywhere on a trip because it is bound to break."

2,Love Hank Music,"Awesome Country Music From Past & Present,If You Like Hank Williams Buy This CD. Every Track Is A Gem & The CD Has Been Compiled Brilliantly Combining The 3 Hanks, Well Done."
2,A very good album,"The reason is that it sounds great is because the album is kinda odd-yet very accessible-the vocals are so unique,The instrumentation is great, the performance is right on the money. The melodies and interplay amongst the various instruments has always held my attention. Oui sounds like the next step of a fine tuned, experimental, rock band. I'm always listening to and buying new music. I have generally liked most Sterolab songs so when I heard that Archer Prewitt had joined I figured I'd take a shot.The occasional electronic textures are cool, not in-the-way. I have been listening to this CD a lot lately. All in all this is a very good album. If you like other bands in this genre like Spoon, Smoke Ring Days, and Death Cab for Cutie, you will most likely like this. The Sea and Cake are the jazziest of the bunch."
1,The message is good but...,"The message of this book is that you always need books, no matter if you have internet, TV or whatever, you always will need a book, this message is written in a book of almost 200 pages, so if someone that doesn't like to read reads this book that person will never read again no matter the message, this book goes out of the story so many times that you almost forget that story, maybe the only book who needs to be burnt is this one."
1,Bad purchase,This is not a very good toy. Sometimes it catches and works but mostly not. Should of listened to reviews. They were right.
1,What's all the fuss about?I had to force myself to finish it,"This is just a warning to those of you who think you may have found a new, great author to read: forget it. I completely disagree that this is one of the best books of all time; the book was boring, and its characters were difficult to keep straight due to the author's annoying decision to name them all similarly."
1,Battery does not work with my Canon SD700,"There is a problem with this battery and the Canon SD700. The battery is too short and the fitting in the camera is very loose. This creates a problem since many times the camera does not work, and I need to shake the camera, or remove the battery and insert it back to get the camera powered.I will recommend to the Canon engineers to go out and buy a flashligth to learn how a battery housing should be designed.Very expensive. Made in China. Does not work. Not recommended.Is there any one interested in a used Canon SD700 with an extra battery?"
1,Not a good product,Pampers changed their diapers and added a new material (or substance) that I can only guess is suppossed to absorb moisture. It is TERRIBLE!!! It has given my littlt guy the worst diaper rash. The first box of diapers I received was great. The fit was perfect and they were identical to the ones in the hospital. The next box was totally different with that new strip and they are just awful. Do not buy them unless they are without the strip (will be white in color and just have Sesame characters). The ones with the strip are blue with sesame characters.
1,"Better beats, but C Murder is still on Tupac's jock",The beats on this CD are alot better than what No Limit has put out before. I just wish C Murder could get off Tupac's jock because he's got Tupacs flow all up in his mouth.
1,Got the wrong product and no answer on my mail,"I ordered Alter Ego for men but got Alter Ego for woman. I followed the procedure given on the the web to complain and ask how to do the return, but did not get any answer."
2,The boy has range does he not??,"Wow...I loved Clay all through American Idol and I love him even more now. Everyone is talking about ""The Way""--beautiful, yes...i love how vulnerable he sounds on the whole CD. He really seems to feel what he sings. The song that sent chills up and down my spine was Run To Me. Clay is AMAZING on this song. I also love I Will Carry You and I Survived You. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was beacause of Perfect Day. The only problem I have with the song is the word ""day."" It just doesn't seem to fit...I don't know...I just don't like listening to that one. This is the Night...wow...amazing. He's gonna go far."
2,Awesome Fun,"My whole family is fighting over this gem! Granted, 20Q misses some easy ones, and gets some really hard ones, but it is one of the funnest things I have played in a while. A must have for long trips. My only problem is that it is flimsy."
1,Snoring,"This book was originally written to be printed in newspapers, newspapers were then used to wipe one's posterior. I feel i have already said enough."
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE,"What a waste of 2 hours. Nothing gets accomplished at all! You watch some terrible graphics, watch everyone die, and they didn't even kill the freaking WHALE!That made me mad.This film accomplishes nothing.There is no point at all to this movie.Don't waste your time, money, and energy.Leave, quickly!"
2,Chrysler/Blower,"This product is exactly what is pictured and fit perfectly. Haven't had any problems, but it has been in the vehicle only about a month.I would buy from this distributor again, especially since their price is half of what a car dealer wanted."
2,Fascinating,I love this movie. I can watch it over and over again. Perhaps it's how cavalier Constantine is about eternal consequences. It is certainly tongue in cheek.
1,Interesting stories - dry writing,"You would have to be dead to not be touched by the stories in the book, but I found Mr. Brokaw's writing style a bit dry. The writing ended up sucking the life out of the stories."
1,Problem with handsets taking/holding a charge,"I bought this phone system about 6-7 months ago. I was happy with the performance, but very recently, two of the handsets failed. I thought it was a battery issue, so I replaced the batteries($30). That doesn't seem to have worked, as both of the handsets still won't take a charge. I have an older 2.4Ghz Vtech which has worked fine for the past 4-5 years, but more recent experiences with VTech have turned me off. Look elsewhere for a more reliable phone system."
2,Michael J Fox shines....,"This is Michael J Fox's at his best. The movie is very good. I can watch this one over and over. Good cast, except Sean Penn overacts his character. Definitely worth viewing."
1,Ida B. Wells: Woman of Courage,"I was very eager to see a video of this outstanding woman, but I was very unhappy with the product. Dull. Two other items included on the video, but the part about Wells consisted of a person reading from a book. Get the book biography instead of this product--a waste of money."
2,Excelente,"La primera entrega de esta saga, thumbs up, la entrega fue justo a tiempo y el producto en perfectas condiciones!"
1,not andy's best.....,I find Andy B to be a very creative and humorus writer....his periodic blogs are timely and funny. This effort however is not his best - it's a joke that goes too long...loses it's punch. It's mainly an opportunistic marketing ploy to take advantage of the Bernie Madoff scandal...and imprisonment.
1,bootleg,"This is a bootleg. There are legal releases with much better sound quality. Buy Grooving Kingston 12 (Hip-O Records), Completer Wailers parts 2 and 3 (JAD Records) or African Herbsman (Trojan Records) instead."
2,Why the '20's Roared,"This disc contains a brief history of great music from the '20's interspersed with embarassing schlock that would make a mother wince. Most people will buy it, and justly so, to hear Bix; however, after listening, the discerning buyer will be happy that he has heard Steve Brown, a very under-rated musician, at his best. Frank Trambauer carries his friend Bix, either through direct inspiration or with wonderful counterpoint in several of the songs. Some of the cuts, like I Didn't Know, have been mastered through a string telephone. But carping about the sound when you're listening to history, or complaining that Chauncey Morehouse was only permitted one high-hat and a snare in the studio, and thus criticising his drumming seems tawdry.This is a great addition for both jazz neophyte and discerning collector of twenties memoribilia. But when you hear the ""restoration"" [sic], you will mourn again the passing of John Davies, who knew how to treat this sort of material."
2,Battery,great for when you need an extra battery. It is a great deal on amazon because the cost would be more at a retail store.
2,Beautiful music,"Christopher Young is an amazing composer and performer. If I had not seen the movie, I would never have heard his compositions. This album would be loved by anyone who is moved by Celtic music. Beautiful!"
2,Easy read...entertaining.,"As always a Maeve Binchy feel good story. Fast read but once I pickup any of her books, I cannot put down until I finish. Characters had depth. Would recommend any of her books."
2,Pharisee bashing,"Excellent book. Lawrence is the only writer I know of who was able to trace the priggish type of American back to Benjamin Franklin. Franklin was a great man, but one of his more regrettable legacies appears in the modern WASP holier-than-thou type, the type that thinks it's inherently immoral to stay up late, and inherently moral to be a non-smoker. Take a close look at his interests and you'll see that it's to his advantage to preach what is, basically, servility. The rest of us Americans can't stand him (I'm convinced that Al Gore lost the election because he embodies this type), but his belief in his own piety remains unshaken to this day. Well, Lawrence gives him a perfectly-placed kick: check it out.All of these essays are thoughtful, funny, and insightful. Lawrence has a unique way of grasping the undercurrents of works of fiction, and many of his most surprising assertions ring true upon reflection."
2,"Engulfing , tremendous makes you feel like you were there","This book is totally engulfing from page one .It puts thereader inside the fall of a great empire . It really makesyou feel as if though you were there . And it also gives youso much knowledge , that you could talk about it as if thoughwere there . A definite must read for anyone interested inhistory , and for those who are not also . Because it is agreatly written story about the most important event in thiscentury"
1,One Thumb Up and One Thumb Down,"This movie seemed a bit okay. I got the story and everything, but there were some minor parts that really didn't make any sense at all. Well basically, it is about an ""Everyday"" Joe who ends up being ""BEST BUDS"" with the popular boy in highschool after the Vietnam war. Well, the story ended up being a ""Happy"" ending, but some of the parts tends to be a little bit on the psychotic side. Like as if the story was pulling you into thinking that the friends were lovers or that they had a few glasses and what not. NOTE: It is a good movie to watch, but expect to be a little confused in some parts (especially in the bathroom scenes). Although, the movie did have a good opening song..."
2,Sansa GP3 Player is good for the value,"My 13 year old son is very pleased with this product.The only problem I had with AMAZON is they marketed it on the screen with a protective skin and power cord to buy ""as a bundle"". Unfortunately, the skin that was shown on the screen did not fit. Not good, AMAZON!"
2,A must for new puppy/dog owners!!!!!,"I used to raise/sell Golden Retriever puppies, and this book I gave to my new owners for their own good. It's an easy read,and easy to understand. Margery West leaves out all the fluff, and gets to the meat of what you need to do, and what NOT to do to raise the model dog."
2,One of the most innovative Cd's of all time.,"Take time to listen to the samples [....] If you do not own this album, then get it. Get it any way you can. The music is beyond innovative. The sounds remain timeles. If you are going to have a party get this CD. Your friends will love it. I personaly have thousands of Cd's and this is by far one of the most important ones. Just listen to it. I assure you, you will not be disappointed."
2,Great Book!,Great book for people that need to write email. It would be nice to review the grammar rule's from time to time.
1,order cancelled by store,"ordered this DVD for the holidays. Purchase was confirmed. After received 4 emails that the DVD would be shipped shortly, the company cancelled the order stating they did not have the item."
2,"very nice feel, and very comfortable.","This Vest feels very nice when its on you. almost makes you feel that you are a member of the local SWAT team. Great pockets, Great size, YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS PURCHASE!"
1,Look before you leap,"I should have glanced at this book's format before I wasted my hard-earned dollars on this junk. It's simply a huge heap of quotes, regurgitated in some order known only to the authors. The ""story"" (simply interviews ad infinitum) unfolds by seasons of the show, without any sort of context, without any stab at putting the times in any perspective, without a clue, often, how the lesser-known characters contributed.It quickly became a very frustrating read, and then became one that left me shaking my head in disbelief.It would have been a good story if the outside world had been permitted to enter into it. But it doesn't. I know the writers aren't lazy, look at all this verbiage!, but it doesn't add up to a hill of beans. Dang, the ratings system doesn't allow one to enter NO stars at all. Save your money. Terrible."
1,"Volume changes, two tapes not understandable","I was hoping to introduce my teens to Jules Verne while traveling; so, I ordered the audio cassettes. However, on most of the tapes, the volume would suddenly go down to be almost inaudible. The quality of two of the cassettes was so bad that only about 1/4 of the tape could be understood."
1,A bit unbelievable,This book targets some very political issues right at the heart of the Catholic church and then (here's the unbelievable part) one of the Cardinals engages one of the priests to kill other priests to maintain the status quo and ultimately become pope. I'm not Catholic but I just don't think the premise of the book or the actions of the characters were believable.
1,Quite a snag here...,"When I received my new TiVo I rushed right in to install and play with my new ""toy"". The instructions were clear and I followed them to the letter. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the second of the ""dual-tuner"" channels working. After many hours and much fiddling I gave up and called customer service. As it turned out my RF input was not working properly; however, I found out something extremely important. New laws require that all signals be digital beginning in 2009. Many providers are currently in the process of changing over now, and according to the customer service rep. the second channel of the ""dual channel"" system is analog only and therefore useless in the new digital environment. I was not made aware of this fact when I purchased the unit as it would have made a definite difference in my decision to purchase it."
1,Classics never die!,"If your looking for a different version of the classic ""Moby Dick"" then fine. Personally I thought it fell short of the mark. The only highlight for me was when Gregory Peck made his apperance as the preacher. The original is still the one and only."
1,This film gave me brain damage,"First of all, its boring. At the 30 minute mark I forgot what movie I was watching. And at two separate points in the film (I forget what points, in fact I seemed to lose all perspective on time) I literally went cross eyed. My right eye is still lingering in a lazy wobble at the moment. All I really do remember was rooting for Leonard Nimoy to destroy the planet and all the retarded humans that inhabit it.Things I learned from T3 - Michael Bay's film making talents could effectively be adapted into a new kind of non-surgical lobotomy procedure for mental patients. I think I dodged the bullet on permanent catatonia due to the fact that I spent half of the movie day dreaming about more exciting things in my life...like porn, and rearranging my sock drawer."
2,She loves it,"Pink Bat-girl is a hit at our house. She loves to dress up. Costume is a little flimsy but will last through the Halloween season and maybe some dress-up after. Skimpy and thin so plan on wearing something under it. (I wish we had bought a size larger) Don't be fooled by the cape it does not go over the shoulders, only behind the back. It is very cute and my 7 year old daughter loves it."
2,Worked like a charm,"Worked great - all we had to do was plug it in! No problems going through setup, and the USB cable is long enough to position the adapter wherever is convenient."
1,Odd,"I called Barry Farm and spoke with two women to find out if there is any possible gluten contamination with the beans. Neither knew if the beans could have gluten on them because they are from a supplier and don't actually grow them. When I asked who the supplier was she rather curtly said, ""I will not give out the names of my suppliers"". I found that odd, on so many levels, and wondered if her suppliers are in China. A company has never refused to give me their supplier before. The best part was telling me I could wash the gluten off when I rinsed the beans. Due to all the recall mania, I am not willing to gamble my family's health. Anyone else wondering what they do grow at Barry Farm? The whole thing left me with the heebie-jeebies."
1,It's not true. I get gypped..,"It's not true. when I received the printer, I found that the printer did not have any cartridge. so, I had to buy the cartridge. the information is not true. be careful. I was very upset."
1,Cheezy and unbearable. Only watched 20 mins,"Had family over and we thought it might be a ""cute"" movie. But it turned out to be unbearably bad. Cheezy with bad acting. Couldn't watch after 20 mins."
2,"If I'm On A Dessert Island, I want this book with me",Frankly I prefer story driven books over character driven books. But not in this case. I feel like I know these people - that I could hear Johnny singing just around the corner on his way home from work. This is an honest and insightful story and I hope it doesn't get overlooked in American Lit classes. There are lines and images that have stayed with me for over 40 years and it just doesn't get better than that.
2,Autoawesome!,"Haven't watched in 3d yet, but we all loved it at the movies, don't know what was up with Megan Fox picking Cowboys and Aliens over this movie. Even though it was a good movie it just didn't have that iconic childhood following to be a blockbuster. This is a must have in your collection."
1,Ringo Starr and the Roundheads: Live,"I was anxious to view and listen to Ringo and the Roundheads concert. But to my disappointment, the dvd was defective! The intro was great, it had sound and video, but the concert segment only had video, no sound.Amazon was great about refunding my money, but I really wanted to see and hear the concert. This was the first time that I bought a dvd that arrived defective. Lucky for me, I had ordered another Ringo and the All-Stars and that was great."
1,My Thoughts About This Book,"Do you like to read about WWII? Then I think you will like this book. In Summer of my German Soldier, Patty meets Anton Reiker, a German Soldier (Prisoner Of War). Patty risks her life for Anton by hiding him in their garage. Anton risks his life for Patty when her father is beating her. Patty goes to a reformatory for girls when the FBI finds out she was hiding Anton. Patty will always remember him, because he loved her in a way her parents never will.I gave this book one star. I did not like this story, because it was hard for me to read and understand. I did not like the way her father always beats her for little things she does like sitting and talking with Freddy a poor boy in the neiborhood that she is friends with. Her family doesn't love her enough except for Ruth, their black maid, & Sharon, her little sister."
1,ABRIDGED!!!,"I bought this so I wouldn't have to spend a fortune on the book for school. Well this Kindle edition is so abridged, I found I didn't read half of the play. Don't waste your dollar. Find another version of this play."
1,failed the first time i used it,"the quality of the lcd display is terrible, low visibility and with a ""rainbow"" effect on the surface. backlighting of the LCD display is woefully inadequatethe operating manual is barely sufficient.the scanner itself hang up on the first time i used and i could not power it down any more i returned it the first day i got it"
2,It was like awesome,Most definitely a wonderful buy and beats the big box store price. The movie was awesome and I can't say enough about the whole experiece.
1,Interesting yet fairly predictable and corny,"I read this book as a result of reading the reviews at this site. While the story held my interest and I had to see it through, I thought the writting was corny and the dialogue phony and juvenille. Eventually all of the sexual overtones became annoying and unrealistic. Perhaps the author would have had better success as a ""Young Adult"" writter, because, despite the sex, that is how this book came across."
1,Headphone Jack Problems,"The headphone jack on my Zen Xtra stopped working day 40 (1st day on a 7-day cruise, no less!) While Creative did replace the unit, why haven't they recalled all Zen's?This is my second Nomad -- I had a Nomad 2.0 20GB, but it's screen stopped working. Creative refused to repair unless I paid $105, so (silly me) I bought a new unit instead.Never again, Creative!"
1,Filth,"My wife and I are both redheads, so we were really looking forward to reading this book. It is absolutely terrible. It is vulgar, anti Christian with no redeeming qualities. My wife could not even finish it. I read the whole thing hoping that it would get better. It did not. I sure hope that it never makes the library."
1,Very Disappointed,"As a teacher, I've enjoyed using this book over the years in my reading program. Imagine my excitement when I learned that the book is on audio. Please understand, the book is worth ten stars, and I really love the story. It is very well written, the characters are fleshed out and believable. BUT... the audiobook is a great disappointment. It is read by the author with a full cast. Somebody forgot to tell Mrs. Phillips that she is from England, and, therefore, has a british accent. The woman reading her part sounded like she is from Iowa. Almost from the beginning I'm listening to audio and I'm going HUH!? This is what happens when you don't pay attention to your own production. I'm amazed that Winthrop allowed this lemon to get out, especially since she is reading on it. Go Figure!"
1,Could be better,"I love soad and I was really looking forward to the followup. I heard chop suey on the radio and I got it the same week it came out. While the songs are very well written, it lacks the flow and the energy from the first album. Perhaps I had listened to the debut a bit too much, but I felt they took a little too much time with this one."
1,Very Disappointed,I signed up with subscribe and save and receive a case of pampers every 2 months or more frequently. When i signed up i thought i was locking in my rate at the price given then and did notice that it fluctuated by a minimal amount. Now when i received my order once again i was disappointed to notice that the price went up a lot about $10 since I started ordering here. By now the price in not so cheap and i may buy elsewhere.
1,The cream does not relieve the itch,"You guys are supposed to be reviewing the cream here, not the spray. And as far as I can tell, this cream does NOT relieve the itch at all! Totally ineffective, and I can't really even tell that there's any menthol in it."
1,Rather outdated Swedish,"I suspect it has been some time since the author visited Sweden or even watched a Swedish movie. A quick glance through the phrases and translations gives me the feel of reading a novel from the 1940s. Using these phrases in Sweden will make you seem either comical or positively moronic.A few examples: Hardly anyone uses the antiquated polite form ""Ni"" any more. It might even be taken as an insult. This book uses it consistently. No Swede would ever say ""Var s god och ge mig resvÃ¤skan"", which translates to something like ""You had better give me that suitcase"". The translation of ""may I introduce miss Svensson"" will sound hilarious in modern Sweden, unless you are auditioning for a part in a period movie from the second world war. If you are in search of an adaptor and ask for a ""transformator"" as suggested in this book, you would probably just get funny looks.Surely it must be possible to come up with something better than this?(For your information, I am Swedish.)"
1,"Not great, but not bad","Firstly, it is incredibly important that you DO NOT use the bundled software for this scanner. The program is confusing and terribly disorganized. I have had several issues with using OmniPage, Readris, and Microsoft Scanning software bundled with Windows. While image quality is good, especially considering the speed of the ADF, the ADF gets jammed during almost every scan with these programs.I strongly recommend that if you have purchased this scanner, use Adobe Acrobat 6 or later. I am using 6.0 Professional and it works like a charm. The file size is extremely manageable (300K for 15 pages) and is quite readable.If you have not purchased this scanner, DON'T. While I don't have any recommendations for other models or brands, I will suggest strongly that you avoid this one. It has been quite an experience, causing me to use Kinko's and similar because I couldn't get this scanner to work. Since using Acrobat, most issues have been mitigated to a tolerable level."
1,I was disappointed.,"I have been searching for a book on 9-11 to hand down to future generations of my family, and I thought that I could not go wrong with a book published by Life. However, after perusing through the book I ended up returning it. If you are interested only in what happened in New York City, this is a great book--but the Pentagon and Pennsylvania incidents barely received a page or two of coverage. Since I live just a few miles from the Pentagon in Alexandria, Virginia and drive by the damaged side each day as I head toward Memorial Bridge to work, that is what I am interested in reading about. I am very disappointed that Life treated the Pentagon as a postscript."
1,3 weeks and heard a big boom!,Heard a huge boom and I noticed the seam had given out and then this huge bubble formed in middle of the bed and then it ripped a few days later. I purchased the product on or around 10-6-2011 and before 11-1-11 it was deflated!
1,"The Return of Randy Watson:""Sexual Chocolate""","I'll give the Neptunes Props for being Successful in a very tough Business to make a mark in&they have been doing well for some time now.but as far as Pharell thinking He is the 2nd-Coming of Curtis Mayfield? NAW!Double NAW!!!! Pharell has Radny Watson written all over Him Vocally to me.whenever I watch Pharell up there singing I have a ""Coming to America"" Flashback.but the scary part is that alot of folks are taking His Singing Career as legit."
1,too high carb for real weight loss,"Each soup alone has over 20g of carbs! And that's just for soup not a meal! To lose weight (not just maintain your current weight) you can only eat 20-30grams of carbs per day, not per meal.Most of these veggie cookbooks are for the rich anyway, a lot of the ingredients are only available at fancy-pants stores like whole foods. I hate to say it but diets like Atkins are within reach for low-income folks. Who has time (or money) to find something called 'mirin' whatever that is"
1,"Works, but not as advertised","I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a ""backup"" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger."
2,works great,Bought it 3 months after pregnancy with twins. I had gone down to my pre-pregnancy weight but my tummy was still not firm. Used the belt and reduced the waist to pre-pregnancy size after wearing it 8 times.
1,Not happy with seller,I ordered and paid for an 8 ounce product and received a 4 ounce product. Now the seller wants me to take a picture of the product and the bar code and send it to them before they will make good on it. I've ordered from them before and there have been issues. Never again....What a pain.
1,WARNING: Here there be monologue.,"Lawhead is, unfortunately, a very inconsistent writer. Sections of each book in this trilogy are excellent and quite enjoyable. However, there are longer portions that are awkward and tedious. The writer also commits a number of literary sins that drag the whole down. In the first book, there is the character of the professor. He is quite flat and is what is known as ""the author's mouthpiece""--a set-piece device used to conveniently convey information that the author has trouble working in otherwise. The professor has at least a couple long monologues that reek of the above device.Although there are worthwhile sections, I recommend you avoid this title and pick up something better."
1,worst book i have ever read in my life(and i read lots!!!),"i thought this was the most boring uninteresting book i was ever fourced to read in enlish class, if it were up to me it wouldnt even get one star!!!!!!! If you are lucky enugh to have to option of not reading this book, u should take advantage of it"
1,Waste of money,"Honestly, the worst diapers I have ever bought. My LO's woke up wet every night and lets just say several other things escaped the diapers when we were using them. I have used several other brands in the past and never had so much trouble. It was so bad that I even called Pampers to complain. Go with the Cruisers, they are much more absorbent."
1,"A Film that's so bad, it's scary","We haven't read the book, but the movie was horrible. It was completely ridiculous and unbelievable. It's one of the worst movies we've ever seen."
2,A good movie but not a horror film,"If you're going to buy ""Turistas"" expecting to see a Hostel"" Eli Roth"" type film ...Your not going to,What you will see is a good, well acted, action packed movie with pretty people, beautiful scenery and some blood ""not much"" but the premise is not Horror it's more like the vacation from hell.Over all I liked this movie and recommend it for someone not looking for a hard core horror or gore film but just a good suspenseful action movie."
2,BRIO Curved Track,BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market. Another must have for train extending. We have about 10 sets of these. It makes it really easy for our son to build whatever he wants. Another great product.
2,Read it aloud - in one sitting! Riveted!,"My boyfriend and I were on an 8 hour car trip and I had picked up this book out of curiosity. I started to read a passage to him that I enjoyed, and before I knew it, I was reading the ENTIRE book to him--we finished it on the drive! We even read it during our pitstops, we were so into it.Now, we are not sailing buffs--...-so I was surprised that I enjoyed this so much. Truly, folks--the disbelief this book leaves you with is priceless. One of the aspects I enjoy the most is that the author has obviously done his homework and lets you in on what these people SHOULD have done...and then tells you what they actually DID... These men were, in every way, to put it eloquently, extremely SCREWED. We found it almost hilarious, though a little grotesque at times. :pThis is NO Shackleton expedition...THOSE boys all came out of it ALIVE............Read it!"
2,Awesome...,"These books are flat out great. The author of the first and 3rd book is somewhat prone to typos, but aside from that these books just flat out rock. They did an impressive job of filling in the back story for Master Chief (John) and what became of the other Spartans before the start of the first Halo game. The recap of the events that transpired in Halo was wonderful too. Then the kicker; in the 3rd book there's a few Spartans left? What a way to lead up to Halo 2. Simply amazing stuff here, if you're a fan of the series anyhow but then again anyone reading this is bound to be."
2,Just Anothr Kid,I loved this book and the way Torey Hayden treats these special children. I have read all of her books and liked every one.She just have been put on this earth for what she does for these children. Excellent writing.
2,"It was pretty good, but could have been better.","I gave this movie 4 stars because it was a good movie. However, it is quite depressing at times. Diane Lane just can't catch a break. It is kinda slow, but I'm very pleased to have seen it."
2,Now THIS is music!,"Wow what a prize to come out of the late nineties. I own many CDs and there's new stuff I like out there but Garbage and their album Version 2.0 are too awesome. Butch Vig, Duke Erikson, Steve Marker, and of course, a role model I really admire, Shirley Manson-- really kick serious a$s! I also recommend the acclaimed GARBAGE debut and obviously, a trip to the official website. Needless to say, VERSION 2.0 blows me away. Seductive, sexy, music, man. I'm so happy I have it + it exists."
1,Sorry this one is boring,"Figured it had potential to be funny. But is wasn't, and not very interesting. Can't reccomend this movie to anyone."
1,Noritake Colorwave 16 piece place setting,"I ordered a 16 piece place setting , service for 4 but only recieved a 4 piece place setting, service for 1. I contacted Amazon and they arranged to have the order corrected and arrange for return for the incorrect order. Once to corrected shipment arrived again it was a service for only 1. I was charged for a service for 4. This was eventually credited back to me however since I only had 2 place settings, I purchased 2 others locally at Younker's department store. The dishes that came with from Amazon are different than the ones from Younker's. It is like the molds were different or something...the plates are deeper from Amazon and as a result the set does not stack properly. I am not certain if this inventory issue has been resolved with Amazon so buyer beware."
1,Missing pages.,Contents references pages up to 375. Book stop at page 342. Three chapters are missing. Good book up until the missing chapters.
1,Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer,"I gave one of the mug warmers to a friend and was told by her that the hot drink in the cup was not kept hot while on the warmer when it was turned on. So I tried the other warmer that I kept and it too does not keep the drink hot even if I had mircowaved the drink in that warmed up cup. I tested the temperature of my old warmer and the surfaces of the two Mr. Coffee warmers and had a difference of 50-75 Degrees higher on my old warmer. I used a ""Deluxe Infrared Therometer w/ Laser"" ""ATD- Advanced Tool Design "" Model ATD-701. I used is tool for mechanic and truck driving to check temperatures on the equipment and any frozen food or other products to watch for temperature varies."
2,An all-timer,Short and sweet since everything has already been said. One of the best rock releases the past 25 years. What an album
1,Does not fit,"The case looks really nice and seems well made. But I never used it because the case seems backward for my TX. While the TX fits well into it, I can't access the stylus or the ports for synching and charging. If I put it in backwards the stylus and ports are accessible but I can't see the screen when I open it."
1,Relaxing entertainment,I did not realise that this was just a book containing the 3 other professor books that I already own and have read.I would not have bought this had I been aware.
2,Outdated but insightful,"The author's style is captivating and simple. He was in Japan over twenty years ago, so I'm assuming that some if not much of his anecdotes may be regarded as dated over there. Regardless, a fun read which doesn't follow the stereotypical 'Japanese kids don't have fun' or 'Japanese people don't have individuality'."
2,Solid Ground,"I thought Kathy Reich's first book ""Deja Dead"" was a quick, fun read, but a little sloppy. Given that the killer kept changing the method by which he killed, it was a wonder that Tempe Brennan actually solved the crime. (Aren't serial killers supposed to be consistant?) Anyway, the atmosphere was good and I'm a sucker for anything about Montreal. Which leads me to ""Death du Jour."" What a surprise to find Ms. Reich in such firm command of the genre in just her second book. She juggles several (try five) different story lines so successfully, you would think this was fifth or sixth in the series. Brava! I dare you to put this one down."
1,Read as fiction,You know -- this is ok -- but- I am an excellent researcher and I have not been able to verify anything that is in this book
2,This is A game that brings a world that could be hours,this game and the music it has bring and emotional feeling to me its a great game but ts more than a game its a way to show us that our world could be just like that in a few thousand years or so they are already making flying cars by the way what makes you not think that the future world can be just like that
2,transformers,really great movie packed with a lot of action keeps you off on the edge you don't get bored or tired of watch it always something happening
1,Thank you Shoryuken.,"Well, the title says it all. I almost bought this because I received a bootleg one with the complete costume. Guess I'll look somewhere else."
2,Like Buttah!,Saw Barbra in Atlanta and this is a wonderful album to bring back the memory of an unforgettable experience! I just hope there is a DVD planned!
2,"One of the best ""Haunted House"" movies I've ever seen!!",I bought this movie after hearing how creepy it was. I was very surprised how good this movie really was. I really liked the parts with the children calling Elanore to help save them. I am very happy with this movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the hottest actor I've ever seen star in a horror movie! This DVD is well worth your movie!:)
1,did not warm up to the book,"the book came highly recommended, but it didnt humor me and I couldnt warm up to the authors style of writing. bored me too...sadly gave up half way into it."
1,"should be titled ""Hollywood Debacle""","The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid."
1,Missing product?,We have yet to receive them?? We are still waiting on this product to arrive. We typically are very happy.
2,Excellent bargain,This CD collection is an incredibly good bargain. The quality is superb and the selections were excellent as well. I am happy I ordered this.
2,Out Standing,"I've never read a book that so profoundly hit me in the heart. This is such an incredible account of one families struggle with something that should never happen to anyone. I read the book in two hours and can't wait to pass Jeanine Cummins name on to everyone I know. This book puts the perspective on violent crimes back where it should be, on the victims. Though this book was about her family Ms. Cummins was able to write the book without turning the guilty into monsters, she made them human which is even scarier. They took three kids and ruined their world and the world of their families. When I finished the book I also realized that the guilty also made Ms. Cummins family that much stronger. Congratulations on such a fine book."
2,SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!!!!,"OH MY,OH MY,SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN.TO THE ONES THAT HAVE MS.FEEHAN'S OTHER BOOKS YOU NEED NO INTDUCTION, TO HER FINE WORK.TO THE ONES THAT DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER DARK SERIES .THIS IS A GOOD BOOK TO GET TO KNOW ABOUT MS.FEEHAN WORK.NICOTETTA AND GIOVANNI STORY IS SO POWERFUL,THAT YOU DON'T WANT THIS BOOK TO END,ONLY LOVE AND MAGIC COULD KEEP THEM AT EACH OTHER SIDE.A KEEPER .....4 STARS"
2,Best album of the nineties!,"Oasis is by far the best band in existence today and this album proves it. With all the junk bands around today like Third Eye Blind, NSync, and Metallica it's good to know that there is at least one band around that is truly dedicated to rock and roll. It's too bad that Oasis has had such mediocre success in the U.S. I just can't stand to listen to the radio anymore. I can't name even one good band in the U.S. It seems to me that all the best music is made in Europe. Great bands like the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and now Oasis have all come out of Europe. Well enough with my ramblings. If you want a cd that will stick to your cd player indefinitely buy Definitely Maybe."
2,who's the archeologist?,"The book makes a great read, same as DHC's other books of the ""Lost Cities"" series. Very entertaining, thought provoking, and well written. One thing though: I don't get why the author keeps calling himself ""a rogue archeologist"": someone has to explain to him what archeologists do. DHC is no archeologist, whatever he might think; he's a traveler, a gossip gatherer, and a free spirit, but all this has little to do with archeology. I enjoyed his open-mindedness, and the relativism with which he judges most of the theories and hypotheses considered. Going through his whole opus, I can't help noticing that this writer is a really great guy, and that his travel companions and friends must have been lucky to have met him, but archeologist? Please, give me a break. And use some proofreader, for the next edition."
2,GLORIOUSLY AFFORDABLE BRUCKNER CYCLE,"I purchased these symphonies when they were issued individually and have constantly enjoyed Tintner's insights and the sheer authority of his readings. Although the conductor uses a variety of orchestras, his vision is imparted to whatever band he is conducting and the engineering and acoustics of all the venues are exemplary.It is unfortunate that Georg Tintner committed suicide because of a particularly nasty form of cancer and we are denied his insights into the symphonic cycles of Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, Haydn, etc.There is being issued in Canada a ""Georg Tintner Commemorative Edition"" and having listened to some of the offerings, his death was a great loss to the world of music and musicology - he wrote his own liner notes to the Bruckner cycle.I highly recommend this set to any Brucknerite as it measures up to and sometimes exceeds the offerings of Jochum - and even von Karajan (no mean feat, indeed!)Timothy Wingate, Ottawa CANADA"
2,life at work is so much better,"This is one of the best purchases I've made in recent memory. I don't know if it will last a long time but it sure makes it nicer to reach over and take a sip from my beverage and find that it's still nice and warm, no matter when I last filled it. I can get pretty focused at work and my drink turning cold is not a welcome indicator of time passing."
2,Delightful!,"This is a wonderful read. It makes a great bedtime story and it is also beautiful (the wood carvings) and inspiring. This is good for people tired of reading what is wrong with the environment. The Man Who Planted Trees is kind of like a sophisticated Lorax book. Anyway, buy this book and enjoy it!"
1,Difficult to attach to boots,"Too difficult to attach to my shoes...I prefer to tie my laces, even though I may have to do it more than once."
1,Leaks!,Big mistake buying these diapers. Baby dry technology does not work apparently - got several leaks. Will get Dry Max next time.
2,An Old World change that's definitely wonderful,The Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful. Ms. Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series (which I also adore). With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christine's work. I highly recommend this book for one and all.
1,Bad acting 101,"It's all been done before but with talented actors. This movie should only be shown in acting school : ""Bad acting 101"". Totaly unconvincing perfomances all around especially by Emily Hampshire, could that mean bad directing? Don't waste time or money."
1,Ruined by neutering the artwork,"I adored these books growing up and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for changing exactly what made them classics. I would have forgotten about them years ago if it weren't for the haunting illustrations. I took them camping, to slumber parties, they were fantastic and terrifying: which was the whole point. To be scared.I have nothing against the new artist and his work in general, but this is not the place for it. To change what made a book a classic for it's 30th anniversary is insane. I can't imagine what they were thinking.If parents are afraid their kids can't handle these books in their original form, they have simply to not buy them books that are meant to be scary or maybe, you know, flip through the book before you hand it to your child. Which is a sad thing anyway, I've seen nothing good come of raising children in a nerfed world, but still.There is no excuse whatsoever to censor such an eerie, memorable, and nostalgic children's book."
1,high school writing!,"this is probably one of the worst books i have ever read. the prose is stilted and trite. i think the only reason it got published was because it is about a lesbian relationship. the characters are flat - no depth is allowed them. there are so many more and better books about lesbian relationships, start with those. if i were to rewrite it, i would yell ""SHOW, DON'T TELL!"" at the writer in a fit of rage. the sentences are reminiscent of Hemingway, except lack his literary value. everyone is rich and beautiful. it is the 90210 of the lesbian fiction world."
1,Way too annoying,"I'm sure the information presented in this class is good, but the presentation set my teeth on edge. Sheri thinks she is funny when she talks in a screeching voice and makes fun of new mother's foibles in her ""funny stories"". I cringed every time I heard her squeal as a pretended mother with a problem. If you can get past her, then I guess the DVD can give you the information and techniques you need for Lamaze. But unfortuanately Sheri spends more time talking or shrieking while trying to be amusing than just giving the information you would like to hear."
2,Great Glider,"We needed to replace a wooden glider that we had in front of our house and after looking around and not really finding what we were looking for our son suggested we check Amazon.com. We chose this one because we felt it would last for a long time and the size was right. When we received it we put it together and it was very easy to assemble. The movement of the glider is smooth. The color is a little blah, but we added a couple of colorful pillows and have received many compliments on it. The price is great and we are very happy with our purchase!"
2,Must watch,"Could not find this movie at the stores where I live, but sure found it on Amazon. This movie was a gift to my daughter for Christmas and I got it way ahead of time and she loved it."
2,"comfy,warm.. but run big","just like the title says. Warm, comfy but run a size too big. I don't wear them out as they are just for lounging, so it's not that big of a deal for me."
1,DVD is a Disgrace to the Original Film,"WARNING: This DVD is in 1.33 aspect ration, so you won't see the same film as the one in the theater.If you have a widescreen tv or 16:9 projection screen you'll have black bars on the left & right sides of your screen that will make this DVD look like a ""TV Movie"".Visually this was a stunning film, shot by one of the greatest cinematographers - Jordan Cronenwenth who also filmed BLADERUNNER, STOP MAKING SENSE, etc. It is such a disservice to him and the film to NOT release this as an anamorphic widescreen DVD so the homeviewer can enjoy the great visuals.WARNER Bros., we'll rather pay a little more, and get quality!4 stars for the film, 1 star for the DVD."
1,Garbage,Only used a handful of times and the bed already leaks air. Waste of money. I know it shows a one star rating but the true rating is zero stars.
2,Must place it one foot from wall!!,"Great sound if you position it one foot from a bare wall, squarely. These speakers need to breathe. Crisp high notes, particularly any Classical music or vintage Rock N' Roll...."
2,Best Chocolate bar ever,This is by far my favorite and the best chocolate bar I have ever eaten!!!!! YUM!!!
2,Good quality recordings,"I have some of these same tracks on another, cheaper CD, and the sound quality cannot compare. This one is much, much, better.I did think it was sort of mean that they mentioned ""Dill Pickles"" in the insert notes but didn't put it on the CD. Pbbbt."
1,Cheaply made!,"These weights break apart VERY easily...the material is very cheap. They don't last and not worth the money, even on sale"
2,What I thought about of Mice and Men,I enjoyed Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck. The book was great cause it was a nice plot. I did'nt want to put it down after I picked it up.
1,Big disappointment,"This video was a huge disappointment. Bought if for my small kids, and it failed to keep their interest. Not only was it slow, but the acting was poor. Rascal the racoon gets little screen time for a movie in which he is the title character. If you're looking for a good animal movie, Charlie the Cougar is a huge hit with my kids, and their friends. It's classic 1970's Sunday night Disney - a treat for parents as well."
1,Don't get this radio.,"I own and use the best radios on the market. I have and use the Tivoli Model One, Tivoli PAL, and Boston Acoustics Recepter among others, and all the ones I just listed sound much better than the Bose Wave Radio, PLUS they are much cheaper too!There is also one called a Cambridge model 88 that is better than the Bose Wave Radio as well.When you are comparing these radios side by side, the first one you turn off and throw aside is the Bose Wave Radio, it is that bad when compared to the rest.If you want a good sounding table radio, I would suggest the Tivoli Model One instead. If you want a good clock radio for the nightstand, then I would suggest the Boston Recepter. Both are available through Amazon.comI don't work for any of these companies, but I have bought all of the radios exept for the Bose Wave Radio, I borrowed one for a day and had no interest in buying one. Even if it was cheaper, and smaller, but it sounded the same as it does now, I still would not buy it."
1,Try something else.,"I just didn't get anything out of watching this movie. It neither scared or even interested me. The special effects were good, but this movie just didn't work for me. Wasn't captivating or that involving. Liam Neeson is a great actor, but even he can't do much for The Haunting. There are better movies out there."
2,"Loved Cher and Vikki Carr's ""It Must Be Him""","Loved Cher's acting and Vikki Carr's #1 song""It Must Be Him"" Whoever picked Vikki's songfor the movie/video knows classy music from a internationalsuperstar. Hopefully, we will hear more on Vikki Carr.Heard they mention Vikki again in ""Vanilla Sky"" too!"
1,Not appropriate for 9 yr olds,My very athletic 9 yr old absolutely could not use this - much too hard - returned it.
2,Simply Wonderful!,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is one of my favorite books of all time. It touched my heart in the same way that Angela's Ashes did. To immerse yourself in the childhood tribulations and joys of a time when life was positively brutal in many ways...it makes you appreciate the society we now live in, flaws and all. Wonderful!"
2,HP Printer is wonderful,"I'm pleased with the printing, coping, and photo reproduction that HP has produced with this gem of a printer. I'm completely satisfied."
1,Tromas war,A shoot em up about a group of air crash survivors stranded on a desert island.This ragtag bunch soon find themselves fighting terrorists bent on taking over the United States with the aids virus.Made by the creators of the toxic avenger this frequently tastless flick combines violent action with totally deadpan comedy.Two versions R rated and Directors cut directors cut has way more gore than the R rated.
1,might be good... if I could stay awake!,"It seems like a large company produces these videos (probably in the 70's or 80's) but it I still can't believe that this is part of a series! Is seems like someone made them in their basement. I can't attest to whether there is really great sewing info in it, because I can't force myself to keep watching it.The woman is reading from a script like a first grader that just finished hooked on phonics. Extremely monotonous tone, I can't stand to watch her and I keep falling asleep... really falling asleep!Other people had mentioned how boring it was, but I didn't think boring mattered if I just wanted sewing info. Boy, was I wrong.The other goofy thing they do is start ""showing"" you how to read the back of a pattern package, but then they forget to zoom in on it so you can't even see what they are pointing to.Why so much money? This video should be a $10 movie (or less)"
2,successful book,"My criticism would be that people with emotional problems with God's grace can still be good spouses. On the other hand, it certainly helps make the marriage easier and with a higher probability of success to marry someone who is emotionally well-adjusted!A great book to help young adults to look at themselves and their relationships so they will have healthy marriages and families."
1,ARRRRRRRGH,"I forced myself through this because someone told me it would be good. Every day I read this I expected to be blown away. Alas, I was disappointed. After several hundred pages of unoriginal dribble and disgusting incest, I finally came up for air. About every three lines in this book I felt like having an aneurism. The ""magical realism"" crap that everyone rants lovingly about in this book is a load of garbage. No, it's not creative. It's boring and annoying. The author randomly throws supernatural phenomena into the story at random points and doesn't have enough originality or creativity to explain it or make it interesting; he just moves on. No, sorry, I won't explain why this person is psychic. Oops, this person just snapped. Sorry. Hey, whaddya know! It's raining flowers. Oh why not I'll throw in some ghosts... maybe some magical gypsies... and we've got an inane bore-fest. Useless."
2,"Enjoyable, fast-paced read","My first time reading Burroughs. Thoroughly enjoyed this book, even with the occasional and distracting techno/biological inconsistencies...an excusable byproduct of the times. Great imaginative story with a good deal of unexpected twists. Fun, quick-paced reading that will hold your interest throughout."
1,Not realistic in the least,"If the producers knew anything about Deaf Culure they would have picked an actual deaf actress to play the role. It is not only offensive but is not even remotely realistic in showing what deafness and deaf culture is like. It only shows a helpless deaf girl who magically hears after getting a cochlear implant. Come on. It takes 3 months to heal after the surgery and even get the thing turned on and then years of speech therapy etc for it to be successful, IF its even successful. The actor was cute, I'll give them that much but isn't it time to let the Deaf act for themselves."
1,Impossible to use,"I bought this for my 10 year-old son. He's an experienced builder, having put together many lego creations and k'nex kits with little or no help from a grownup. He couldn't assemble the tanks. The green collars that are used to connect tank sections are very tight (to keep water in, I suppose), and he just didn't have the coordination or strength to push them together. I was able with much, much effort, to get two sections of a tank connected, but I couldn't even get the top on.I called the help number and left a message. So far, no response.The girders are also not very well designed and come apart with a little jostling.I wish I'd never bought it. My son really, really wants to see it work and so far we've spent many hours to no avail."
2,Different! Non-denominational and so well done.,"I love spell books and if you are the same way, this is a must have for your collection. It has it all: The days of the week best to perform a spell, the phase of the moon, magickal tools,directions to face, formations to cast etc. It is your cookbook type of publication which makes it easy to figure out. The affirmations before each spell are beautiful. They make you think and are good advice. Diane stays non-denominational and combines belief systems. I have heard you should not combine systems and then I have heard whatever works for you is best.Well, the way she takes you through these rituals is perfect for me. This book is different because it is not based on astrology, just the basic moon phases. I loved her other book ""White Light The Complete Guide to Spells and Rituals for Psychic Protection"" but for me this book is more fun and something you use time after time..."
1,Well i Know Where All The Talent went After At The Drive In Broke up!,"First off, my opinion comes from a musicians veiw.I began listening to At the drive in when they hit the scene in the mid 90s....i was turned on by their weird time changes and aggersive vocals. When the band broke up i was upset and i felt that the void would not be filled. When i heard Omar was fronting The mars volta i knew he would stay true to experimental music, and indeed i was correct.I can not say the same for Sparta how ever, i find that Cedric's vocals are often flat and they sound more like an unexperienced singer. Their music falls short, maybe more production could be used to beef up the songs. I find comparing the mars volta to sparta an unfair comparision. The songs in general are caught up trying to be punk when they sound more like un inpsired emo tunes.......i guess maybe they are trying to hard to please......have you seen the videos!"
2,beowulf- FIRST BOOK in the ENGLISH LANGUAGE,"I am reading this book in my ...english class. This book has everything there is for a book to become a great book. This is probally one of the best books I have ever read.Some of the names are hard to pronounce, like Schyld Scheffing,but it becomes easier to read as the book goes on. My class and I have all enjoyed this book very much.I would recomend this book to anyone and everyone."
2,Office Max wants $40 for this,"It works on my laser printer. Only after receiving the product did I realize there is another type of film made by the same company, specifically for laser printers. This is technically for copiers (same premise, I know)."
2,Wonderful story,"There's nothing like autobiographies, especially when written by people who are/were so excited and enthusiastic about their lives. This is one of those books. She makes you excited about life and its possibilities just by being so excited about it. I loved this book."
1,Worst Toy Ever = Batman Animated Batcave,"Do not buy this toy. If you are given this toy as a gift, return it for store credit. This is a flimsly and poorly designed stack of platic and paper. The secret door doesn't work, the elevator doesn't slide and toys get stuck in there. The suggested 10"" batman doesn't work with the zip line, bungee or even the elevator. The add says ""Using new adhesive technology, you can set up the Batcave on just about any wall"" so they want us to glue this thing on to a wall.Please don't buy this toy."
1,Awful beyond belief!,"I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!"
1,Buy the import version instead,"For whatever reason, Rhino decided to leave off the SACD layer of all three U.S. Depeche Mode re-releases, which is a real shame. If you have an SACD set-up, the audio quality of the import versions is noticeably better (especially on ""Speak & Spell""). Plus the DVD is region free, so the import video will still play in your PC or Mac (although it will not play on your TV, unless you have a DVD player that can convert PAL to NTSC). I highly recommend sending Rhino a message that selling watered-down versions in the U.S. is unacceptable, by purchasing the Mute label import version instead (all three of which are outstanding)."
2,Awesome!,Girlfriend loved them. Price was better then local area stores. She has other colors of the same shoe so they last a lifetime.
2,"good heat, cheap wheels","I bought this from a local retailer for only $30 (less than 1/2 of the Amazon price). While assembling the wheels, one literally shattered in my hands. I brought it back for a new one and the same thing happened. The third one assembled fine, and the store gave me 3 spare wheels, just in case. I don't know if I would have shipped two of them back to Amazon.It throws quite a bit of heat for such a small unit. We bought this to replace an older radiator of the same design and the difference is striking. I also noted a bit of an oil smell, but that went away after a few uses. All in all, a good heater, but"
2,don't judge by the title,"At first I judged this book by it's cover. DON'T DO THIS!This is a really good book. It's about a teenage girl, Kathrine, who meets a Quaker woman and a little girl and they become friends. Then When a bad sickness comes that clames a lot of lives the people blame the Quaker woman, Hannah and Kathrine. Kit leads Hannah to safty with the help of her friend, Nat. Kit is caught and must stand trial.There is no witchcraft or anything in it. It is not a very fast-past book but worth the read.It is a really good book and I would reccomend it to any Christian or non Christian 12 - adult"
1,Beware of the size of this book!,"Beware of the size of this book!If you are expecting to receive a regular size art book, you will be extremely disappointed. The book measures 7.5 x 9 inch and is thinner than my pinky finger.However, if you are just interested in the content, there is a lot to look at and to read."
2,good,good why would I want to keep writing writing and writing while all I wanted to say is good. strange.
2,"Great Book, Couldn't Put It Down!!!","Orwell portrays a great image of a utopian sociaty, although the part in the story where Winston is reading ""the book"" is rather boring and takes a while to read. Overall I would suggest reading it as soon as you can."
1,I was fored to read it too,The Scarlet Letter is a good but long and discriptive book. I wouldn't tell anybody to read it unless they classic books or a Hawthorne fan. This book and also The House of The Seven Gables are based on the one unlying rule of Hawthorne description. His books wouldn't be so long if he would have just gotton to the plot. Now don't get me wrong the plot to this book was good but the movie is even better. If you have to read it just deal with it. All I know is that is didn't hold my attenion very long and I fell asleep a couple of times.
1,Waste of celluloid,"It takes a lot for me to not like a movie, and Rollerball managed to pull it off.I can't decide where it went wrong, or if it just was never right. The whole motorcycle chase thing to the border was unnecessary and seemed wedged into the movie; kinda unnatural. And the fact that the whole sequence was filmed in nightvision was just plain weird. I don't know what gave them that idea. The brief nudity seemed to come out of nowhere and added little to the plot. I had to rewind it to try and understand why on Earth it suddenly happened. The action sequences were ok, but considering what the plot was, it seemed overly dramatic. I work at Blockbuster, and this is one of the few movies that I tell people not to even bother with."
1,"Not working most of the time, worse than my neighbor's $15 unit",Not picking up signals consistantly.TV Frequently goes into 'Signal Not Found' mode.My Neighbor has $15 UHF Antenna from GE(i think)which works much better in consistency and signal quality.
1,NOT WATERPROOF BROKE IN ONE USE,This is TERRIBLE. I have had this for 3 hours and it is already broken. It is absolutely NOT waterproof. Do NOT waste your money.
1,as silly as the cover,"I liked the first single ""How Did You Know"", so I decided to check it out.The songs and productions sound flat and unimaginative, nothing too new or exciting here.I cant remember even one of the songs. Sounds like they needed to throw this one together fast...and the rap made me chuckle."
2,My 7 year old daughter loved being batgirl...,The costume was perfect for my daughter and the best part is the costume came with every thing you need to be a very adorable batgirl. The quality was good as well.
2,Garbage is the best band in the entire Sol System.,"Garbage rules so much, it's impossible to describe in words. Every single CD of the four I have of theirs(Garbage, Version 2.0, Special, and Only Happy When it Rains) is to the point where I like every single song they've ever had. EVERY SINGLE ONE. There are over twenty-five so far, and still much more to come, I'm sure. I don't need to use the playlist function on my CD players--I can listen to each. Besides Version 2.0, buy every other one they have out! ""I think I'm Paranoid"", ""Only Happy When it Rains"", ""Stupid Girl"", and ""13x Forever""(""13x Forever"" is only on the ""Special"" Single import from Britain)are in my opinion Garbage's best songs. You have to hear them. GUFFYPUP'S APPROVAL RATING (1-10): 26"
2,I liked this book.,"This was a good book. I just finished reading it for a tenth grade English class and it was good. It was kinda boring at first, but I liked it. I would recommend it to my friends."
2,This should be required reading of every high school student,This book made me smile and made me cry. I now have a much better appreciation of my parents generation. My generation and the ones following should learn a valuable lesson from these people. We have become a selfish and lazy society and should be ashamed of ourselves. Thank you Tom Brokaw!
2,"This book is a real roadmap, precise and thorough","This book is an indispensable tool for any woman who is facing (or contemplating) a divorce with custody issues and who doesn't know how to even begin the process. It's a ""comfort"" book in the sense that it is precise and reassuring--almost a roadmap to follow-- especially when life seems out of control. This manual is a great resource to share with friends."
1,Too broad and too liitle info,"Not knowing Wind River the guide really did very little to help plan a trip excpet for forming a general idea of where to go and what to see and climb. On this level it fulfilled it's job, but I was hoping for much more."
2,yummy,their not only good for you but their yummy.they smell like cloves when their cooking and taste a little sweet.
2,Wonderful Debut!,"After listening to the entire CD about 6 times, I am completely in love with each and every song! I have to admit that wasn't my initial feeling after the first listen, but these songs (and THAT VOICE) just grow on you. I can't get enough of it. My favorite is the title song.I agree that I'd love to hear Clay make a CD with some of the classics that he does so well. Maybe that's next. For his debut album, however, it couldn't be better."
2,not immoral,"this book is surely one of the best. its meaning is crystal clear : in life better strong than weak. the fact is that the king doesn't steal food or money like those weak officers , he just buys low ans sells high. what clavell wants to say to us is that making money out of other people's stupidity is much better than being stupid."
1,I can't give it 0 stars.,"But if I could I would. My 3 year old son has every one of the bob the builder toys. The trucks and vehicle toys, for the most part, are great. Every single one of the playsets are junk and will fall apart the first time you play with them. They are of poor design and as you see in other posts they can be dangerous. DO NOT BUY ANY!!!"
1,Do not buy. This is a BOOTLEG,"Since when did Amazon have the legal right to sell bootleg CD's? I purchased this cd so I can listen to it in the car, ( I have had it on wax for 20 years)The CD is a CDR... When did Amazon buy the licensing rights to Music of Life? They are charging people $15.00 for a bunch of MP3's burnt on to a CD lmao. I give it one star because it is a CDR.."
1,Redundant and Too Expensive,"This book is not on the FRM reading list. The author already has one book for the GARP exam, and this one covers all the same material in much the same manner. There is little that is new here. It is just regurgitating the same stuff. The message seems to be that, if you can't make sense of his first book, you should shell out $100 to give him a second chance. Save your money. It is not worth it."
2,none better,"These are the best at cleaning between teeth other than floss. I never leavehome without em. They are good, good, good."
2,A thriller as brutal as its title,"The Bottom Line:A somewhat forgotten film whose Criterion release should heighten its exposure, Brute Force is a raw and intense film about an prison riot that belies its Hays Code era setting to deliver violence and tension throughout its running length; if you like your films rough and ruthless, get Brute Force.3.5/4"
1,Just terrible,"No, it's not as good as the original. But let's rate it on it's own merit - hmmm, it has none! This movie sucks whether you compare it to the original or let it try and stand alone! One of the worst movies of recent years, it has ridiculous acting (except for Liam Neeson, but it's not like he's good, I don't know why he did this) and one of the stupidest plots I have ever seen in my life. This is such a waste, don't buy it, don't rent it. This is a terrible movie. Period."
1,AMAZING BOOK,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a great book. I'd recommend it to people of all ages. It should be required reading for everyone! An excellent book from cover to cover.
2,Child called it,this book is so heart felt. He makes you wonder how the system failed him and many others. I always wondered how his mother was never charged of put in jail for life. The very least be treated the same way.
1,Nice player except.....,"Nice player except the microSD card fails to be recognized anymore. The problem isn't the card (I've tried several), it IS the Player. The disappointing machine just fails to recognize that it even has a card slot. The expansion card slot is meaningless. And what with an appalling 90-DAY WARRANTY, you can see Sansa has little faith in their own products. It is really to be looked at as disposable. Get it really, REALLY cheap, or get something else. The rest of the machine operates fine and it pretty reasonably intuitive. But....but, the expansion card issue is a massive, strange failure. I wouldn't recommend this (or perhaps any SanDisk product. This just SHOULD NOT happen."
2,THE book on this unique style,"If you are researching illumination of Spanish Codex and manuscripts this is the book to have. There are only two books written in English that cover this unique style; the other book on Spanish medieval illumination is:Early Spanish Manuscript Illumination. The quantity and quality of the pictures in ""The Illuminated Manuscripts..."" make the price worth it. Spanish 10-11th century illumination is quite separate and unique from the rest of Europe using lively imagery, repeating patterns and vivid color combinations. This book captures the spirit of Spanish medieval artwork and shows the world the finest examples of this form."
2,Nobody would believe this in a novel...only true crime!!,"It is hard to imagine how the three characters in this triangle came to be involved, but the author did her research well (complete with photos) and shows us how it all happened. How could this multi-millionaire make such terrible bizarre decisions? And this is a true story!"
2,An Original Work of Art,"..And that's saying something nowadays. I still love listening to this album, every song on it is different and equally engaging. ""Isobel"" is my favorite, an incredible tune. You can't go wrong buying this CD."
2,great book,very interesting and good. so many years and still true! looks like statistics never change. should be read by everyone.
1,Lysenko in music,"Welcome to the nonsensical ramblings of the Trofim Lysenko of US musicology, Joseph Kerman. The bilious opinions of Kerman, a conformist snob whose lack of depth, judgment or taste is meant to be obscured by relentless aggression and malevolence, are best ignored, or even used as a reverse guide. The opera lover does not need to care about what this intellectual dwarf has to say. But I pity those for whom Kerman's opinion has ever mattered professionally."
1,"Nice bike, but no pedals or instructions","I know the bike is great, and everybody that reviewed it agrees with that. However, either Cadillac or Amazon are making a good product be more a hassle than a pleasure. Not only did I not get instructions (which others have remarked on), but no pedals!!! After reading all reviews, there is one other person complaining it did not have a kick stand. Mine does, but now, up to fighting for those pedals. Overall, knowing about these problems, better go with another one. I don't know if I want to go through the hassle of returning it, but maybe I will just in hopes they will do something about the poor packaging quality. There is a Columbia comfort bike that was my alternate choice."
2,Simple but Perfect,"""Fahrenheit 451"" is one of those rare books that goes straight to the heart of its issue, what we are doing to ourselves in this TV/Multimedia crazed society. So much more than a cry against censorship, this book is a rallying cry for us to wake up and see what is happening all around us. From the video walls to the relationships of children and parents, Bradbury is eerily prophetic in his predictions. I can see why some readers today would feel uncomfortable with this book; the truth not only hurts, but sometimes it can be downright damning.P.S. This is not a young adult book. The levels of symbolism and prophecy make this a read much more appropriate to an older, more mature audence."
1,Don't Go There,"Despite the great rating and rave reviews, I curse the day I brought this one home. I have gone through at least a ream of paper in the three weeks I have had this printer--not because I am so productive, but because the paper jams so often and the printer actually shreds the paper as it tries to eject. Several cries for help and complaints to HP customer service resulted in ""that's a common problem. The arm doesn't detract after each page. You will have to manually reset the arm whenever that happens."" So far, that means 6-8 times per day. No more HP for me! This is my second bad experience. You would think I would have learned by now."
2,Outstanding boot at a great price,"This is the first time I have purchased hiking boots online. I hike a lot. 40+ miles per week generally. I wear out hiking boots in about four months, and am getting tired of driving all over the place trying to find something that fits, and isn't too expensive. These are great! Comfortable right out of the box. Sturdy but still flexible enough to move with your foot. I have only just started with them - but at this price, and with the Amazon Prive fast and free shipping: I will be coming back here for more when I wear the treads off of these in a couple hundred miles."
2,Super,"I have the DVD, and the blueray version has more color and the sound really pops out. The movie line of good versus evil is the theme, but it has a unique twist from the standard man of God versus the demon theme. If you have't seen the original, I don't want to spoil it for you."
2,What was Rita's goal in this film?,"Dicuss the name changes which the character of Susan White (aka Rita) undergoes as she matures into an ""educated woman"" Tell why she changes her name,and trace the various changes she undergoes as she entercounters different influences on her road to maturity."
2,Simply the best,"I teach business writing in industry and government, and I recommend the Gregg Manual enthusiastically in all my programs, at every level. There are a lot of wonderful resources out there, including Albert Joseph's classic EXECUTIVE GUIDE TO GRAMMAR, that can help you understand what makes our language tick, but there is nothing like Gregg when you need an authoritative answer NOW to a specific (even picayune) question. And it's striking to see how EXCITED seemingly well-balanced people from all walks of life can be when they first get their hands on Gregg. After reading the other reviews here, I am even preparing to do the unthinkable and buy a new copy - just to see what the new edition has to say about computers (my copy is a little old...)."
2,Batman,What a great movie. Blu-Ray is the way to go. I would not hesitate to purchase from this retailer again. I am very please with the purchase.
1,Sound Catchy but mix with Terrorists,I have to agree some songs sound very catchy.But isn't she singing about some Terrorist Group in some Asian Island? I heard even MTV ban some of her songs because of that.
1,Awful-chemical smell,"I have solely been a pampers mom but after buying these I'm thinking of trying something new.The diapers reeked of chemicals, very unhappy and very upset that I had 246 to go through. I will not buy diapers online again, at least not these."
1,Disappointed,I was really excited to receive this product after reading the reviews. A day later I'm quite disappointed. The bunny ears are razor sharp! Oucccchhhhhh!!!Definitely save your money and go for something else
1,um.. and the point of this was??????,"I am going to be a freshmen in high school. This book was on my summer reading list and as I began to read it it's flow totally lost ME IN THE DUST!!! I am not stupid, in fact I am in the top 99 percentile of all kids in my grade across the U.S. After having to write down all the characters and list their traits i believe that I can grasp a few chunks of this novel. O well.Yeah, just don't even try this book."
1,Would like it if it ever arrived in one piece!,"I ordered this cake plate and dome for my mother, shortly before Thanksgiving of 2002. The first time it arrived, after 3 weeks, it was in about 1,000 pieces. The UPS driver realized that upon delivery and returned the item. When it was sent the second time, which wasn't until around Christmas, it arrived with the handle to the dome broken off. So, long story short, no cake plate for Mom! Amazon.com should really examine how they pack items like this."
2,A page turner,"I read this book in one sitting, mesmerized by the great story and the great characters. The plotting was superb; there were enough twists and turns to keep me surprised, but at the same time everything seemed thoroughly believable. I loved the multiple levels of the plot(s), just who is pulling the puppet strings and how much autonomy do the puppets have? The minor characters were as interesting as the major ones and the villains were engaging too. My only quibble was that it took me a while to get used to the names of the people at court - all those k's and h's and y's!"
1,The worst movie I've seen ever! Awful!,"I have never been so compelled to review anything until I watched the movie Last Days yesterday evening. The movie was about absolutely nothing. The character who is supposed to be Cobain just mumbled, walked around, and passed out the entire movie. It was awful and a complete waste of my time. I was seriously angry after watching it, because I stayed up to watch it. How does this crap ever make it?"
2,good movie,I liked the movie I cant say it was better in HD but it was the first movie I saw on my ROKU player and was impressed.
1,The One Redeeming Feature of This Piece of Tripe.,"What a pathetic, degrading waste of talent on the part of actor Bela Lugosi, cast ludicrously in what comes close to equaling such bottom-of-the-barrel schlock as BRIDE OF THE MONSTER. And yet...and yet......if you love Lugosi's mellifluous, Hungarian-accented intonations (as I do), just sit back and ignore (or ""enjoy"") the film's imbecilic dialogue, implausible plot, stilted acting, and utterly hilarious direction, and allow yourself to be carried away by the erstwhile treasured voice that gave Bela Lugosi the fame and stature he so rightfully deserved back in the 30s from such memorable films as THE RAVEN, THE BLACK CAT, THE INVISIBLE RAY, SON OF FRANKENSTEIN and, of course, DRACULA."
2,Excellect Value and Fast Service,"When I am in need of a product I spend a lot of time doing research. Not only are the costs of the product and shipping/handling charges important but also the speed, accuracy and dependability of the company/person involved. I highly recommend this source to be checked out when searching for specific products."
1,Very Not Worth Your Time,The book was wriiten very horribly. I would never in my life recommend such a book. The stories lacked any mystery to them and did not leave me wanting to figure out who the culprit was. The only good thing was that none of the stories took up ten or twelve pages.
1,missing most of chapter 20,Luckily I have the physical book too so was able to read the missing bit. Suggest you try another kindle version.
1,Mailstation and Dilbert,"My experience with Mailstation started over six months ago. Since then I have had less than two weeks of email service. Just a few of the problems have included a Mailstation arriving with a broken screen, six weeks of phone calls to finally prove the replacement did not, would not and never would work, a month waite for another replacement to find it was in shipping, two weeks later to find no record of replacement, etc, etc. One technique is never being allowed to talk to the same person twice. ""I will call you on Monday to verify it is working."" ""This will definitely fix the problem."" ""Sorry, you can not talk to a supervisor."" ""We will send you a refund in one month."" ""The refund will be posted in two weeks."" ""We have sent the refund to your credit card company but it will take them two or more months to post the refund."" ""The problem is with your credit card company. We have sent them the refund."" I do not think so.The Dilbert cartoon is Mailstation."
1,This book appeared to a small group of shepherd girls,"Unlike other religiously oriented books such as the Da Vinci Code, in this one you really have to take religion seriously. If you don't believe, then the book will look silly. If you do believe, then the book will make your beliefs look silly. Kind of a no-win situation. I found it boring.But, more importantly, can we stop publishing books in which ""suspense"" is created and maintained by telling the story from two or three perspectives, then breaking up these stories into three-page fragments?I swear, I almost grabbed a razor blade and cut the book up so that I could reassemble it into a coherent narrative."
2,Amazing wear to sleeep...,I recently purchased this item and I can't say how relaxing it feels wearing it. It's made with a high quality silk and does not stick to the body. Best part of this pajama set is that if you take turns in your sleep it really does not hold to your body as it slips through giving you that ease of turning over on your back or belly. Loved it...would like to order more...
2,Beautiful West,"Never read a Zane Grey novel so when it was offered on my Kindle for free I decided to give it a try. I was surprised that such a ""vintage"" book would be so relevant to current day. It is full of beautiful description and passion for the West and its scenery. I enjoyed the well written story and was surprised by the woman's journey into a life with purpose. Will read more of this series of books."
1,garbage,"Transformers the Movie (1985) was awesome. But these Transformers look like a pile of garbage throw together. The CGI animation makes everything look like synthetic barf. The Transformers movies need a reboot, where the characters actually look like they are supposed to. And without the worlds worst director Michael Bay. Disgusting. Don't let your kids watch this atrocity."
1,Confusing,"Musk Dogs...Fountainheads..and a spaceship that's been on the grill to long..Two crabby women that fight for 50 freakin' years or is 18,000 years! Yes I finished the book..I know why some wanted to leave the ""structure"".Granted the first part of the book is full of promise, chasing down Janus and the problems that ensue...but then the wheels fall off. Read the first 1/3 of the book then pick up something else."
2,SUPER DUPER!,"THIS MOVIE STARTS OUT PRETTY DARN STUPID BUT,IT GETS REALLY GOOD REALLY FAST!THE ONLY THING I HAVE TO SAY IS THIS.WHWERE'S LUIGIS MUSTACE?ALSO WHAT HAPPENED TO PEACH?IT'S A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE.I SUGGEST MAYBE GETTING THE ENTIRE FAMILY TOGETHER FOR THIS HILARIOUS MOVIE.IF THERE'S KIDS THAT ARE MARIO FANS IN THE FAMILY THEY'LL BE WATCHING THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR ALL THE ACTION AND LAGHS OF THIS GREEEEEAAAAT MOVIE.EVEN NON-MARIO FANS WILL ENJOY THIS.TRUST ME."
2,Smoke Rings,"This is an excellent album. The title track Smoke Rings is exceptional. It was the band's closing theme song. All the tracks have a uniqueness to them. Well worth having in your music collection. The track ""My Heart Tells Me"" has some very beautiful vocals by band-vocalist Eugenie Baird. It also contains one of the great songs from the 30's ""A Hundred Years From Today"" sung by Lee Wiley. Her voice and the band make such a great song even better. Take a magical trip back in time and purchase this great album!!!"
2,a good deal,Alot of people have complained that this could not possibly be the entire first season of the show but it is.... Even if the show had such a short first season it was still a really good deal. It arrived right when it was supposed to and it's a pretty good aswell!
2,A book that long? Are you kidding me?,"Yep, that was my reaction when I first heard of the girth of this book. I tend to believe that if you can't write a good story under 600 pages or a very little bit more, you can't write a good story period. I stopped picking up any book over 600 pages by authors I didn't already like years ago. And even though I really like the work of Lackey, Flint, and Freer, it did take me a few weeks to go get it and then read it. I read it in about two and a half days, a better pace than many a book half it's length. The characters are all worth reading about no matter who you fell most drawn to. The world is a little harder to adjust to than the run of the mill (DRECK!!) stuff that is usually based on northern European mythology were English is the norm and German and French are thrown in for 'culture' and 'scope'. Not only a good read but it has put any follow on's into the top portion of my must buy list."
2,Pictures!,I bought this for a friend for her birthday and it didn't have a picture posted but from the description I figured it was the old version without the scary lady on the cover but it wasn't. Oh well.
2,Great study guide!!!,I studied my butt off with the help of this book. The practice tests in this book were actually harder than the real ASVAB! That helped me be even more prepared. I only missed 5 questions on the ASVAB! NO LIE! Study this book for about 3 weeks and take it seriously. You will see your scores improve!!!
1,No Disrespect,"You talk about bigots! We have adopted 3 black children, 'tho we already have 5 biological. We are so darn happy that we have saved our 3 from the horable, unetical, imoral life that is epicted in this book. If that is how Sister has lived her life, we see absolutely no reason why she would brag about it. Also, while white students are worrying about their student loans, and wondering how in the world they will ever be able to pay them back, little or nothing was said about the African-American students concerns about their pay-back. Oh, yes, I forgot ""We Owe You""(?) Great that Sister Souljah is trying to help her ""brothers"" and ""sisters"", but maybe she should start with teaching them some morals, and maybe cleaning up her act while she is at it. Sister is a talanted writer. We hope that someday she will find something more uplifting to write about."
2,excellent music; poor re-master,"Pompeii is an excellent CD. The music is in the vein of ""Old Loves Die Hard."" This CD, however, is a bit lighter overall and even more prominently features B. Palmer's somewhat flowerly yet pleasant vocals.In my view, the 2002 re-master of this CD is just plain poor. The bass is too heavy and dull, and the sound lacks brightness. Increasing the treble, manually, will help the music to shine. Also, the bonus track is merely an edited version of the last tune on the CD, so its inclusion is hardly of value."
2,fun and educational,"We put this together as a family and it was fun and educational too. I was happy see my family learning and spending time together. The puzzle was tricky but, fun.We will do this puzzle many more times as the kids grow up I am sure. I recommend it!"
1,save your money,"save your money. go to the library and read it there. spend five minutes and you have the miter angles you need- out of the whole book that is all I took away. If you want to buy a copy buy it at Home Depot- same price but, the book is in color with much better pictures and in more detail. I feel ripped off."
1,Hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this,"Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most partwith a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in themain role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be. A lot hasbeen said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this moviehas to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she doesmake you care about what is going on with the movie while you aretrying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is beingtold. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movielike this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essencethere is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiececompared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at thevery best.For Weisz's rich and powerful performance, I give the movie one star.If she were not in the movie, my rating would be in the negative numbers"
1,Low Quality,"Bought this product for a friend's visit back in late October. Since then (It is now early February), it has been slept on for a total of seven nights by two different normal sized adult guests, and promptly deflated when a third guest tried to sleep on it this past week. To its credit, the product did last just fine through those seven nights. It did, however, break not too long after the 90 day warranty ended and we have no reason to believe we will be able to repair it or otherwise recoup our loss. Purchase with the understanding that this is basically a disposable air bed with a warranty that seems conveniently short."
2,A Charming Book,"""Jim the Boy"" is one of the most simply, yet beautifully crafted novels I have read in quite a while. One one level it may seem to be somewhat simplistic and a quick and easy read. However, the skilful and artistic author has in fact written a deep and emotionally moving novel about the depression-era childhood of a fatherless boy under the care and guidance of his mother and three uncles. I confess to reading this only because it was the featured novel at my book club this month, but am so very glad that I did. I found it fascinating to see how Jim's uncles guided him through life's sometimes hard-learned lessons with both toughness and compassion. I look forward to my group's discussion later this week."
1,Not for true beginners,"I bought this book after reading the reviews. The impression I had was that this would be an excellent introduction to Java. What I discovered is that this book ASSUMES KNOWLEDGE OF C++. If you dont have some background in C++, then skip this and go for something else!"
1,Disappointing,"This review is for people possibly looking into the Beta Band because of their single on the High Fidelity soundtrack. Drying the Rain is a great song, but unfortunately the formula that makes it a great song does not carry over to the rest of the album. It really is just a bunch of noise. Main stream music fans should pass this up and stick to the soundtrack. Trust Me."
2,Old format,Old format and examples that have not been changed through countless reprints. Good general book for an intro. stats. class.
1,OH MY GOD!,"One sunday afternoon, I sat down to watch this movie with my girlfriend, and sat back awaiting stimulating entertainment.... HOW WRONG COULD I BE!What a complete load of utter complete inane useless rubbish this movie is...it is only funny if you are over 60 and like to sit in a cinema in a sleeping bag discussing being an old aged lesbian with nothing better to do than watch drivel with no point and a plot as predicatble as a an predicatble thing in a very predicatble place!I will not even offer this for re-sale, as I am so looking forward to destroying it in the most imaginative way possible....any ideas???"
1,One erotic passage in the entire book.,"I kept thinking that Elliot and Lisa would really get down and dirty at the ""Club"". Was I disappointed when they actually only had sex once, and in New Orleans to boot!!! I will say that the one time they did have sex was worth the price of the book. But the rest of it was very poorly written."
1,Disappointing,"If it were any other band, I'd probably rate this higher, but my boys just took a bad turn. I don't know what Chris was thinking when he wrote these lyrics. How he went from the poetic ""Girl From a Pawnshop"" off of Three Snakes to ""Heavy"" and ""Kickin' My Heart Around"" is beyond me. He used to write the best words. Also, the album has too much noise; if they've completely changed their style, I don't like it. Hopefully, they were just trying to get their name known again, and they'll go back to their good stuff from now on."
1,It's no longer the worst movie on the subject,"Quite aside from the historical gaffes-- which are many and well documented by others-- it's a really lousy movie because the characters are so clumsy. Everyone is nasty to everyone else. Bad attitudes pass for 'drama.'I thought it was the worst movie on the subject of all time, but have recently seen the newer ""The Red Baron."" While that movie has much nicer airplanes, it has its own long list of historical absurdities-- I think it 'wins' the race to fairy tale.But on top of that, the dialogue is so silly and the editing so chopped up that you can't even follow the storyline.So ""Von Richthofen and Brown"" is only the 2nd worst movie on the subject. Still awful."
2,for my daughter,"My daughter loved these dvds so much, we have ordered every set, not to mention it comes with a figure."
1,wish I had bought the small can,"I really wanted to like this, but it is just not something I seem to be able to adjust my taste buds to. I had read reviews other omnivores liked it, and it wasn't just for vegans or vegetarians, so thought it would be better than it is. The quality of the product seems fine - even flakes and nice color, but oh, the taste is something that ruins oatmeal or anything else I've tried it in."
2,Works well with the Tivo series 3 HD,"Just plug it in to the USB port on back and the Tivo series 3 HD ask you if you would like to use it. Tell it yes and it is an easy setup if you know anything about your wireless G router setting. (SSIS, Security Password WEP, WAP, Etc Be sure not to set it on top of the TIVO as it reduces signal strength. It has a pretty long cord long enough to get it away enough not to be effected."
2,Best Album of 2003,"I am amazed at the number of reviews posted for this album. It has become my favorite and plays once or twice a day in our house and/or car. Actually, had to buy two as my CD changer loader/ejector is broken and you have to unscrew the top, and do all sorts of gymnastics to get CD's in and out....it was easier to buy another for the car. This is an album that gets better with age, it grows and grows on you. It is an album to sing along to, an album to play softly in the background and an album to listen to with headphones. All the songs are good, I don't skip ANY of them, which as I (and other reviewers) usually do. Measure of a Man and The Way are probably my favorites, although Shine is marvelous - well, darn - they are all marvelous and I hightly recommend this CD to all ages. I eagerly await more albums from Clay and predict his career will be spectacular."
2,Not a Batman Fan,"I have to qualify this review with the following disclaimer... I never followed the comic book series or cartoons as a kid or teen. I'm just an adult female who LOVES movies, especially superhero flicks. Now, with that said, I have never been a fan of the Batman franchise. I found the earlier Batman films, despite their all-star credibilities, be ""over the top"" in every deparment (set, acting, dialogue). As a fan of Christian Bale, however, I was anxious to see the Batman Begins installment. Bale is an amazing actor, even in his younger days with Empire of the Sun to much later with American Psycho or a little more recently with The Mechanic. This was the finest of all the Batman films - darker and with more depth. It was good enough for this non-Batman fan to purchase for my home collection."
1,The diapers actually FALL APART.,"Every night we put our 1 year old in one of these diapers, and most mornings he wakes up not just leaky, but with the seams of the diaper opened up and the absorbent material all over his clothes and skin! But since we bought so many we have had to keep using them and dealing with this disgusting problem day after day.They are fine during the day, when we change him fairly often. But during the 12 hour night time they are useless. Huggies leak too, but at least they don't explode."
2,"In the vein of ""Chocolat""","What a delightful work of art. I was enchanted with the film and the music definitely caught my attention. I'm always looking for a little ""off beat"" music, i.e., Chocolat was my last favorite CD, but now this has moved up to first place. I highly recommend it for ecclectic music lovers who like that ""off beat, out of the way, different"" sound."
1,Not for experienced users,"I purchased this book with the idea that it might teach me something new, but I was mistaken. If you already have basic Photoshop knowledge, this may not be the book for you. I returned it because my money would be better invested elsewhere. If you have no idea where to begin with digital artwork, then I would recommend taking a look here. This is for the novice, not the intermediate or advanced user."
2,A well liked gift,"I bought this for my father as a gift. He seems to really enjoy it. Being something he had in years past, the hand held infrared devices became a little hard to locate. While this one doesn't seem to have the super high build quality that ones did from years gone by, it does the job and as the gift receiver my father seems to be very satisfied with it."
1,Foundation [is not good],"...It is awful, truly one of the worst books that I've ever read...Good writing does not not to be defended like this, and the need to defend a book in this way prety much proves that it is a substandard work."
1,Numbers Peg puzzle,This number peg puzzle is not for a 2 year old! You cannot tell the nine from the six and depending on your child's age he/she might be confused with the colors of the pegs to the colors on the background.
1,A complete misrepresentation of the classic trio,The packaging is beautiful. Any fan of the Three Stooges would love it except for the fact that the majority of this material on this DVD set isn't the classic Three Stooges we grew up to love. It is VERY MISLEADING.Anyone defending the integrity of this release should be considered an employee of Madacy Entertainment.
1,So-so,"I thought ""Tubthumping"" was pretty good,no,really cool,but the rest! UGH! Those songs were a complete BORE. If you are planning on buying this CD, I strongly advise you not to. Buy a single of ""Tubthumping"" instead,or borrow it from a friend,if you don't have any friends,from a CD rental store.My apologies to the people who enjoyed this CD."
2,Este libro si vale la pena comprar,"Este libro es tan preciso que que es casi increible. Mis companeros de trabajo, vecinos, y familiares me llaman a consultar sus suenos porque siempre el significado descrito en este libro acerta tan increiblemente que he tenido que comprar unas cuantas copias para regalar. Al principio no le daba mucha importancia del significado de mis suenos pero luego me comence a dar cuenta de que todo me sucedia justo como lo describia este diccionario de los suenos. Ahora hasta mis 3 hijos estan todos fascinados.Mercedes, Florida, USA"
2,"Excellent portable stand, especially for touring","The Pyramid Bottom Bracket bike stand is a great option to take along on those overnight rides. For example, when I do the DALMAC ride it allows me to stand my bike up during the overnight stays instead of laying it down on the ground or trying to find a (scarce) tree at the campground. With my bike standing I can then hang my riding clothes on it to dry in the sun. For these reasons I highly recommend this portable bike stand."
2,Loved it!!,"This movie was different, as in it's more dug into the past of Bruce Wayne. Which I loved, since Batman was becoming very one dimensional in the other movies. Emotion is the key to this film. We learn how Bruce becomes Batman, and HOW he earned his MIRACULOUS combat training! Christian Bale is extremely beautiful, and very sincere as Bruce Wayne. It doen't hurt that his chiseled body looks good if, it was drenched in wipped cream and cherries.This is the best Batman movie I have ever saw!"
2,So far so good,"Great item, keeps my coffee warm throughout the work day. I do wish there was an automatic shut off after so long, though because I get paranoid about that kind of thing."
1,BE WARNED: DOES NOT WORK,Do not order this DVD. It does not work. The HD player will tell you that it cannot load it (error message) after 10 minutes of trying. Looks like everyone else has had this problem as well. I called Amazon for a refund and recommended that they pull this item. It DOES NOT PLAY.
2,Long but interesting,"I got interested in reading this book after viewing the Masterpiece Theater showing of the Forsyte Saga. It was interesting to compare the movie's interpretation of the book, and it gave a little more insight into the motivations of each of the characters. Overall a good book."
2,Brought back memories,I loved this series when I was younger and it first came out. What a great story line in the Marvel Universe. Buying the whole series in one book like this was a real treat. Thanos and the Infinite Gauntlet rock!
2,Real winner!,"Love this item - it cooks very well and never sticks, which allows quick clean-up. The food tastes very good and is soft and well done - just the way I like it. This is a very convenient and easy to use pot."
2,Classical perfection,Tess of the d'Urbervilles is possibly my favorite classic. Thomas Hardy is a brilliant writer as evidened by this novel. If you've never read it please do so. It's free on Amazon. You will fall in love with Tess and curse the life she is dealt.
1,Something wrong with these diapers,The swaddlers are so much better! These are not comfortable and they leak. I would not recommend these diapers to anyone.
2,Thank our lucky stars government isn't like that...yet.,"Orwell creates a frightening picture of how easy it is to manipulate human minds using extreme nationalism, unification from a common enemy, misplaced love, and the love of hating things. Readers ask themselves ""WHY? Why do these people let themselves be subjected to such mind control?"" Really it's all the people know. Somehow to them it makes perfect sense that the past doesn't exist. Scary. One of the best books I've ever read"
2,Squeem works well,"I am pleased with this item. It would be helpful if it were slightly longer for my torso, but everyone is different of course.I wear it a lot and it has held up well. It is rubbery, so a base layer is important or you may break out when your body perspires."
1,Only 126 questions !!!,"There are 6 domains and 20 objective, in those 6 domains, of Exam, so count how many questions are per domain (6!!!). Some topics have only 3 questions, and on Exam you will get 3 or more questions from that objective.Before every domain there is list of articles (Training Kit + Books Online) to read for that domain, and every time they write how to start Books Online (klik Start menu, Programs, etc.) 3 - 4 line for somebody that goes on 70-229!!!.1/4 (to 1/3) of almost every page is unused (empty).If 2 or more answers are wrong for the same reason, they will repeat explanation, several lines, again and again.Some questions are for total begginers, and for some you need a lot of expirience.During my web exam expirience I noticed that questions are a little bit easier than the most on the Internet.So if you are total begginer and you have extra money, buy it, but for expirienced people I recomend something like www.certportal.com or other web sites."
1,I'm afraid it sucks.,"I saw the negative reviews and thought it must be user error or bad luck to blame, but I'm afraid it's all true. My brand new Simpletech card has gone mysteriously crazy, within 10 minutes of popping it in my Canon S230. I don't care what the explanation is, frankly-- card error is a scary thing to see. Magically, replacing my trusty (if allegedly slower) SanDisk cards rectifies all problems. I swear, I did nothing wrong-- it's idiot proof. This card is just wacky."
2,great item,"SG1 Continuum, is a great movie. The CGI is flawless and over all a great movie. I hope it isn't the last MGM does."
1,Pump broke during first inflation,The cheap plastic pump broke while inflating it for the first time. The ball itself seems fine so far. It's not quite at the recommended circumference because of the pump breaking. I ordered a separate pump to fill it the rest of the way.
2,"confusing, but good","Being in high school, it took a little bit to understand it, but after a while, I was able to get the basic point of the story. If you know you'll have to read this for school in the future, read it ahead of time. That way, you won't be reading on a deadline, which makes it worse. Read it at your own pace and you will understand it more. Also, the second time through, when you have to read it, you will see many things that you missed, and the story will be much more meaningful to you. (You'll do better on tests and quizzes, too.) Even if you're not required to read it, check it out-it's not called a classic for nothing!"
2,"Does a decent job, one minor flaw","I have 2 Tivo's at home and a Mac running Tivo to Go software and I am constantly moving shows back and fourth between tivos and the computer. I once had this adapter on both TiVo boxes and the transfer rate was decent. I could start a transfer and within a minute start to watch the show being transferred without having any ""pauses"".What I didn't like about this was the design. The foldup antenna piece I think should be more solid or ""lock"" in the up position. I positioned this behind my TV and if a cable hit it, etc the antenna piece woudl fall down and the transfer rate woudl slow considerably.As for installing it, couldn't be easier. Plug it into the tivo, go to your network settings and enter your network information. I had it up and running in less then 5 minutes per tivo and have been running the adapters since 2/2009 so it's been about a year and a half with no issues.I would recommend this."
2,VEXX,"This is a very cool, very fun game - much in the vein of Ratchet & Clank and Jak and Daxter. The only problems were the maddening camera angles (tough to control) and the feshman swimming controls. And don't bother with the Prima Strategy Guide. It's very basic, dosen't cover the controls, and just skims over the walk throughs. It seems as if it was just slapped together to meet a deadline."
2,Need to give Prodigy a break....,"Everyone seems to hate this single but I really like it and I have gotten my roommate into liking prodigy just because of this single. I would agree that it is a bit lacking but I wouldn't guess that they've been trying to make a cd for 6 years, guys. They have to have gone vacation or just a break in general after the Dirtchamber sessions came out. So I would say that's a bit unfair to make that claim. Anyways I'm a diehard prodigy fan and own almost every single song they've put out (except the What Evil Lurks E.P) and I would suggest anyone who is like me to pick up this single."
1,Not recommended,"Pro: Soft-closing valve mechanism prevents water hammer effect.Cons: Programming is not intuitive. Cannot adjust the manual valve-open time duration; it is fixed at 15 minutes (the manual states it is possible to adjust this, but I did not see how). 9V battery didn't last a week."
1,"See my article ""Jean Hill - The Lady in Red"" online","Since writing my review of JFK: THE LAST DISSENTING WITNESS in 1998, I have been able to have my 35-page article - ""Jean Hill -The Lady in Red"" - included in Clint Bradford's JFK Assassination website. The address is: http://www.jfk-info.com/sitemap1.htm (scroll down for title)."
2,4 STAR SERVICE,Awsome Book highly recomended for those intrested in reasing fine literature however those weak of heart it truly is a sad story and shows the cruelty of humanity for those in George's positon however I truly recomend the book for anyone
2,An Astounding Story,"I learned about the story of the Essex in researching my family history. Captain George Pollard, Matthew Joy and Owen Coffin are all distant relations. Philbrick does an excellent job taking the reader along on this fateful, dark journey. This is a grim, harrowing story and it's hard to read. However, I came away amazed and respectful of the courage these men demonstrated- especially the young Owen Coffin. I also appreciate Philbrick's sensitivity. When things get pretty dismal, Philbrick relieves the reader by interjecting educational explanations for what is happening and why. This book is a must read for anyone interested in Nantucket history, Moby Dick or inspirational stories of human courage and perseverance. The sea is not for the timid!"
1,Please just run far FAR away from this film.,"It is wayyyyyyyy too long and completely aimless. Some may call it ""complex""; but I call it crap. There are a few little laughs here and there - but nothing that would make this worth sitting through. Even when one steps away from the fact that this was not intended to just be a comedy and rather attempts to tackle some more serious content.....it still sucks. Don't waste your money. Watch ""I love you man"" or ""Grandma's Boy"" or something that is actually entertaining. I wish someone had warned me."
2,Mostly Great Stuff!,"Man I have to tell you people that you are way to harsh. This album is almost the best Oasis ever. If it wasn't for My Big Mouth and maybey I Hope I Think I Know. Other than that it is great. The song Magic Pie has to be my favorite Oasis song it is mesmorizing. The line, ""those who don't say what they mean live and die by there own sword"" is a great lyric. Listen to it good and well and you will love it. If you like rock of coarse."
2,A great dance groove.,I haven't as of yet come across another album with such a wonderfully mellow techno-jazz beat. One of the best music purchases I've ever blindly bought. Especially good for those listeners who enjoy a hauntingly beautiful women's voice laced throughout their beats. Cannot reccomend this album strongly enough!!
2,Bond performance,Good quality of music and great show. Lively modern mix of classical and rock music. If you like electrified classical music you will like this.
1,Pretty bad choice of direction for Queen,"What happened in 1980 that made a lot of good bands turn sour? Disco! Queen was a victim of the times and perhaps a horrible identity crisis. While Body Language still pops up on greatest hits packages, that track is not enough to warrant buying this album. Stick with Queen's 70's releases."
2,Great if you have the RIGHT sound setup,"I almost sent this item back because the sound was so uneven going back and forth between loud and soft for no reason. luckily I ran across a comment by someone who mentioned you had to use 5.1 or DTS in the sound setup to get it to work right. Sure enough, Doby sounds awful, but when I selected 5.1 the sound was perfect. After that I enjoyed a really great concert with some excellent cuts from Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler-Dire Straits, Sting, Paul McCartney and many others. Brothers in Arms, Money for Nothing, Layla, Hey Jude and a great rendition of Kansas City with everyone joining in. If you think you might like this DVD you will, so buy it, just be sure you use 5.1 or DTS!"
2,Pretty entertaining,"Bought this on a Lightning Deal, and have enjoyed it so far. There is a lot of content for the money and it is funny to see what Canadien Broadcasting was like several decades ago. Oh, and there is some good piano playing as well. Gould seems like he was an interesting, if not a little strange, person. It's sad that he died so young of a stroke."
1,Just because she couldn't do it,"Doesn't mean other women can't. This is complete drivel. There are thousands of happy children of working moms (myself included) who would disagree with the author that working moms somehow can't be good mothers.Furthermore, this is classic Michelle Bachmann hypocrisy. If the author truly believes that women are best off staying at home and washing dishes, perhaps she shouldn't be writing a book. Her husband should be the author.In the meantime, leave the working moms who can pull it off alone."
1,Cute bra but bad elasticity in bands and no support,"The elastic used for the band very easily loses it's elasticity and thus loses shape quickly (after one wear I noticed the difference). For a molded style, this bra loses it's use after a week. It's pretty but poorly engineered."
2,Another one done!!!,"Very very good!!....I can usually figure out who did it, not this time. so many complicated twists and turns. Great read!!!"
1,Obtuse synthetic nonsense II,"Seriously, the first review with this title nailed it. I saw a different Takeshi Kitano movie a few years back which was much more stylistically interesting (can't remember the name, but it was a Japanese film), so I know he's capable of making an interesting film. This isn't it. This film is a terrible waste of time."
2,Making the Invisible Visible by Keith Devlin,What a wonderful book. You just have to read it and then you will understand.
1,Soothing,Creates a big mess. It's also pretty small so it gets very boring after a while. I've had it for like 6 months and used it twice. and that was the first week i got it.
2,Best method if you must do wireless,"I would suggest a wired connection (especially for HD boxes) but if you must do the wireless, this is your best bet."
1,"Cheap, double dipping scumbags","While walking to the counter to PAY for this release, I turned it over to read what extras were included. NONE!!!!! Nothing!!!! I put it right back on the shelf. I am NOT paying full price for a bare-boned release! The greedy corporate thugs are counting on you to buy this, only to wave something a lot more enticing in front of your eyes when sales for this dwindle! Sick of these rip-off tactics!!! I have no sympathy for their loss of revenue from movie pirating! If they treated their customers with respect, perhaps the problem would not be so widespread!!!"
1,For Simple Minds,I bought this book because of the reviews and am shocked at how one can become an author by simply stealing life experiences and stories from other peoples lives. I felt the book was shallow and was perfect for people who couldn't think for themselves. Any human being with half a brain can see through the empty content of this book.
2,skeptical about pop music...,"i'm usually really skeptical about pop music. if that pop sound is comin' outa the radio, ya gotta listen to the lyrics! Stacie sounds alot like Christina agulara, but i often question christina's meaning behind her lyrics, like in Genie in a bottle ""if ya wanna be with me"" and ""ya gotta rub me the right way"" really make me ask questions. when i listen to Stacie's album i know that what i'm listening to is clean and pleasing to God. this is defenitly the cd to buy, because everybody knows that you eventually memorize what you listen to no matter if you mean to or not. that also influences your thoughts. don't ask any more questions, just buy this cd right now!"
2,What a great movie!,"I have liked this movie ever since I first saw it. Since then I have watched it many many times. It's one of those movies that you just can't get sick of. The romantic escapades between Rick and Cheryl are wonderfully depicted through the eyes of a teenager. It's a funny, sad, and romantic movie that I recommend to anyone."
1,"Poor Design, Construction & Quality","We purchased six of these heaters in February 2006, and by November 2006 only one was still working. One was DOA, two died within one week of arrival, and the other two died over the next seven months. We live in Southern California so these heaters were rarely used so its not like they wore out. Repeated calls to DeLonghi customer service went unanswered, and the local service company they refer to in their service manual is no longer in business. We are very disappointed with the heaters and DeLonghi and would not buy one from them again."
2,"Nice, energetic and inspirational cd.","I was very excited to get this cd and I was not dissappointed. Clay is a wonderful singer with a big clear voice with a very good range. What I liked most about this cd is that the songs deliver good messages and no dirt. I would say that this album is a mix of pop rock and inspirational. Some of my favorite songs would be:Invisible- fun, upbeat, and good lyric about not being noticed by the person you are attracted to.The Way- Wonderful, romantic and I expect that it will be played at a number of dances and proms.I Will Carry You- reminds me of the songs Bridge Over Troubled Waters and He's Not Heavy, He's My Brother with its moving and inspirational message.This is the Night- another romantic song that gives me the tingles.Measure of a Man- This song could easily fit in a gospel/inspirational album. Fabulous message in it.This cd makes me go back and forth between dancing and getting teary eyed. I bet you will feel the same way."
2,opinion de compra,estoy feliz con la compra pues no conseguia numero grande en chile para mi esposo. ademas la entrega fue rapida
2,KC....................MLMS..............!,"John Steinback is famous for writing book that took place during the Great Depression. Steinback's book ""Of Mice and Men"" is about two men, Lennie and George ,trying to reach their dream of ""living off of the fat of the land"", in other words they want to own their own land, be their own boss. While trying to reach this goal they run into many problems. Lennie has a problem of touching soft things such as rabbits, and he ends up doin some bad things at Weed and at the new ranch.In my opinion I didn't like this book alot because John steinback likes to describe the setting and i couldn't really picture it very much. Also, the ending of this book was very tragic and sad. I would recommend this book to any age because its a classic story that many people have loved and still rememeber after they read it."
1,NOT perfume sensitive baby friendly,I know many people swear by Pampers and I did find their fit to be very pleasing BUT both of my children had significant allergic reactions to the light scenting added to these diapers. For parents of babies with sensitive skin these may not be the diapers for you.
1,Bad Bad Bad,"I enjoyed the first movie. I didn't think the second was as bad as everyone thought. Wow, this one was just atrocious. I'm not going into specifics as I'm sure the other reviews have but do not spend the $4.99 on downloading this. Wait for it to come out on HBO or whatever."
2,You can get as a podcast,"This is a good resourse, but if you are thinking about buying this book, do realize that you can download the lecture free as a podcast on iTunes."
2,No diaper rash ever!,"I am a first time mom at the age of 36 and I have a hard time over-analyzing everything!!! I was so worried about all the horrible diaper rash stories I've heard, but so far we have not encountered that problem once! I love Baby Dry Pampers! They are nice and thin and the only time we've had any leak problems was when she was due to switch to a larger size."
1,"Some good qualities, but no cohesiveness or overall point","I am an avid reader, and I don't mind a challenging read. I started reading this book at the suggestion of some colleagues, and a woman in my book club. I know it is considered a ""modern classic"", won the Nobel Prize, etc. - but I couldn't even pretend to like this book. To the author's credit, his imagery and descriptions are beautiful. I admired the magical world that was evoked by the style of storytelling. But the plot was next to nonexistent, and after about 100 pages, I really felt like I was on a road to nowhere. The story went off on tangent after tangent with no real, identifiable purpose. Reading this book gave me the feeling of being locked in a room with a very creative, yet nonsensical crazy person that won't shut up. After a while, it gets old."
2,I'm very impressed so far,"So I just got mine today and I put it on right out of the box. Like some have said, takes a few minutes to get used to it. I've been wearing it for 5 hours now and I just love it. It covers everything that needs to be covered (and I am long-waisted). It stays put, which I love. It's comfortable. It makes my waist look great and flattens my stomach ""pooch"". It's comfortable enough to sit in. Best of all, instant posture makeover and it is easing my lower back pain by providing support. I'm looking forward to wearing this for a long time and already foresee a black one in my future. I wonder if I can wear it on my runs? Hmmm... Also: I have a size 31 inch waist and the medium fits perfect on the first loops. Just take your measurements before you order. Hopefully, as I lose weight (from my running/training program) I can cinch it to the tighter loops and get a little more use out of it. Well... then I'll just have to get a size small! I love it!"
1,Xenote itag was far better,"Sony just stole the idea from Xenote, iTag was far better and it was Free. iTag was working and has far more station, it was so simple to use that you just needed a single plug to work. They steal idea and they are not even abble to steal it correctly. It's just a shame for a such big companie as Sony."
1,Ugh,"To preface: I am not religious and I am politically liberal. This book was terrible! The beginning was up to par with all the rest of the novels you can pick up at the grocery store, which warrants a couple of stars, but the ending was terrible! The third secret was just a bunch of the author's political views shoved into the mouth of the Virgin Mary. I was disappointed that I read three-quarters of a book's worth of build-up only to have such a ridiculous climax."
2,"Nice features, but you get what you pay for","I liked the power rating and that it will turn on passively with an analog input (such as the stereo out from a flat screen TV). Shipment was lightening fast and packaging was top notch.Amazon has(d) it on sale for 80 bucks, so jumped on it. While the sound is tolerable it doesn't fit in with the quality of the rest of the system. So this will be relegated to anotherroom and I'll go for the Crown Amp like I should have in the first place."
2,Real reason behind the murders was to free Bobby Beausoeil.,Helter Skelter motive is a little far out. Real reason for murder was a copycat of Beausoeil's murder of Gary Hinman.
1,Who's Laughing?,"This is an ongoing hoax perpetrated, sustained and constantly embellished by a Literary Establishment who simply wish to award each other doctoral degrees in pretending to understand this mishmash of a book. It may very well be the worst thing ever published. It is certainly the worst thing ever published with college courses based around it."
2,good hero,I've read the whole series and loved it. The McGee rants about everything from how to drive or mix the perfect drink to how to treat women are inspired. Read them all in order and have fun!
2,"What I Thought Of ""Of Mice And Men""","""Of Mice And Men"" is a terrific book! Especially at the end when Lennie gets shot. I just love the foreshadowing, for example, when Lennie kills the mouse, then the puppy, it leads you to beleive that he could maybe kill another thing, and then Curley's wife walks in. I also love the awkward pair,Lennie, the slow, large man, and George, the smarter, smaller guy. Altogether, I enjoyed reading this book and I will probably read it again! I give it four stars because I just couldn't put it down!"
1,Awful!,"I've not had paper jams or feed problems in ten years. Now they are back! In two months I have printed perhaps 100 sheets. Now there is a problem with 3 sheets out of 4. Every other HP printer that I have or have had feeds paper with no problem at all, but this one does not!"
2,awesome,Awesome cd will be back to get more music great service great music to offer to people really good prices on music
2,mask maker,"I liked the film it has what every horror likes in this type of movie the suspense,mystery,good and bad times,plus a shocking ending that makes you think that there is more to story, and plot was very good Robert."
2,The best of the set,"Les Annees BechetLike another reviewer, I was turned on to Sidney Bechet by Woody Allen's Paris at Midnight, which used Bechet for the opening and closing titles. I ended upbuying essentially every Bechet CD I could find on Amazon. In my judgement this one is the best not only by containing the Paris at Midnight theme but other great numbers. Bechet's September Song is truly great."
2,Happy Feet,"These boots have that classic hiking boot style to them. The NuBuck leather looks great and the boots are comfortable and seem well made. I'm not really a hiker. I just like to wear hiking boots in the winter and these are perfect so far. I wear them everyday and I like them so much, I was thinking of ordering another pair!"
1,A waste of time..,"Well for starters monique's stand up always involve male bashing because by the looks of her I can understand and the other comedians were garbage as well (except for paul mooney). This was by far the sorriest shaquille o'neal comedy video in his production, I definitely do not think this video was funny."
2,It really helped me,"I had very bad hoarseness from acid reflux. Prescription medicine wasn't helping. My doctor advised elevating the head of the bed with blocks but that was not practical. I showed my doctor a picture of the prop up pillow and he said it looked to be the correct dimension. Within a couple of days after receiving my pillow my hoarseness was gone! Yes, the pillow appears expensive but it is much less expensive than buying an adjustable bed. I don't use the neck roll - I prefer to use my own memory foam pillow. My doctor said the back roll is to help keep one from sliding down the pillow. I strongly recommend this pillow to anyone with GERD/acid reflux."
1,"powerful the title, empty the content",I bought the book with a lot of expectations and I was disappointed. The author keeps on sayng trivial statements as if they were his own discovery. Not a very useful book.
2,Our favs,"We tried 4 or 5 different kinds of diapers when our son was born from all the samples and such. We got a pack of these from a neighbor and they worked the best of all, so we've stuck with these. You can tell how wet the diaper is by feeling how inflated the diaper is. Wish I was using cloth diapers but that didn't really work out for us due to logistics (no washer) and I wish I had a more ""natural"" choice, but others are more expensive and don't work as well. These are 14.5 cents a diaper w/ Amazon Mom."
1,THE MOST HORRIBLE ALBUM,I HATE THIS ALBUM. ALL MODERN R&B ALBUMS SUCK. I HEARD THIS ALBUM AND I MADE MY HEAD BLEED. WHERE THE HELL ARE THE BALLADS CUZ THERE ARE NONE. WHAT THE GODAMN HELL WAS BRIAN MCKNIGHT THINKING. HE SHOULD STOP MAKING MUSIC GOD DAMNIT. DATS WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.
2,Iteration,"FW is not a piece of literature. It is beyond literature: It approaches life and non-life. Is life easily analyzed and coherent? Is non-life? Joyce recognized the dichotomy and tried to capture the incapturable in words. He taunts the reader with meaning and the critic with nonsense. Ultimately, both the divergencies converge and vice versa. Take a look at the Mandelbrot fractal: Numbers approach nil and infinity giving alluring patterns in a mimicry of life and non-life. Joyce creates the already-created, concurrently destroying the already-destroyed.A long the...Joyce presents the question - forbidden fruitriverrun,Joyce slithers toward us - temptationpast Eve and Adam'sJoyce plunges the reader into chaos - banishmentWe find ourselves ensnared in a recirculation, striving once again for order, until we realize that we must step back in order to find Truth.I haven't even read the book, but does it really matter???"
1,Doesn't get to the meat of things,"I'm a huge fan of both the film and the author (check out his music!) but was pretty disappointed by this book. While Jaworzyn's choice of quotes (it's told 'oral histroy' style a la Please Kill Me, etc) certainly gives insight into things such as the process of making the film and the now legennadry financial fallout that followed, very little is told about the characters or the script. The detailed descriptions of what exactly went into filming border on the academic and may bore the bejeezus out of anyone who doesn't already have a background in filmmaking. There is very little information on the writing process - maybe it's just me, but I would have preferred to hear who inspired the Hitchhiker character, for instance, than read pages about foreign licensing and shady deals."
1,Copy was highlighted,The copy recieved was not as described. I was expecting a clean used copy and I recieved a copy that was used as a text book and had yellow & green highlighter and hand written notes in the margins. I could not give it as a gift.
1,I didn't buy this movie because it was too dumb.,I think Michael Bay may have phoned this one in. There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't know where to begin.
2,Love Unrealized,"This play taught: That love cannot survive prejudice, young love is powerful because it is raw, no one can control nature, and more."
1,kind of cool at times,"i like quarashi's sound, it's fun and enegertic. but it doesn't really move anywhere or explore any possibilites. i think they have some real talent but these guys seem too content just throwing out obscene expressions like a bunch of 15 year olds that have finally gotten a hold of the main office's pa system. i have to say that the people who try to push these guys as sounding like korn are TOTAL MORONS. quarashi sounds sort of like the beastie boys on steroids...that's the best comparison i can think of. if you're not really looking for anything deep or particularly inspiring but instead want some mindless music, quarashi is fun. but if you have enough of that in your collection already, skip this one."
1,way too long,"I agree with whoever wrote that this book was way too long and unorganized. I was hoping to learn more about the behind the scenes works, and boy, did I. Drugs, partying, sexism, racism, it's all here and more. There are some great gems among all the trivia people already know.But it's all quotes from the different actors, writers and producers. There are some photos to break things up, but nothing else. No cute little sidebars or anything. Heck, if it's good enough for my school textbooks, why not put some in here. I don't have ADD, but it got tedious after awhile.The format makes for an odd read. You get things like someone rapsodizing about what a ""beautiful person"" John Belushi was a couple paragraphs after someone reminiscing about the time he set stuff on fire and passed out in a drunken stupor. Oh well."
1,"Worked fine, broke quick",My HP Deskjet 500 worked for more than seven years before I finally traded up for a color printer - the 940c. I've had the 940c for just over 1 year and it has broken. I'm buying a Canon this time and keeping my fingers crossed for better quality.
2,Reasonable interpretation of a classic,"When you start with such good material, it's hard to please everyone. Like ""The Lord of the Rings"" many reviewers are disappointed that the movie didn't match their own visions of a great book. (Notice how no one ever complains that ""Goldfinger"" or other Bond movies are significantly different from the Ian Fleming novels?) Personally, I thought the re-telling to be convincing, I liked the way they kept the story moving (it IS trying to cover 20 years) and found the special effects ""good enough."" My kids have worn out the VHS tape and I'm buying a DVD because we enjoy the movie.Lastly, just a pet peeve for other reviewers who complained that Telemachus' double spear throw defied physics...HELLLO!!! last I checked, three headed monsters defied biology!..and that whole Hermes flying thing, totally bogus eh? People..this would be a FANTASY with GODS and GODDESSES, not the new BBC special ""Walking with Odysseus!"" Sheesh!"
1,The worst book i have ever read in my Life,"This is quite simply the worst story i have ever read in my life.It was depressing, LONG, and meandered its way aimlessly till the end. Whats worse, the book could have ended half way and still had the same impact. The character still meets the same fate, everyone would have felt the same way, and the reader would have been spared several chapters of agonizing reading had she made a different choice after confessing her secret to Angel.If you like reading a depressing story where it seems like the author is taking sadistic joy in tormenting the protagonist, this is the story for you. For everyone else, stay far far away."
2,Great,Even though I am an atheist/agnostic I still appreciated this book for what it was... funny. I particulary liked the philosophers. But the greatest character had to be Om.
2,"Popcorn, Spaghetti -- More, Please.","I bought this for the first time on a whim about three months ago. Love it, love it, love it. Love it on popcorn, crave it on my spaghetti (with a touch of parmesian cheese added to it). I eat spaghetti for lunch maybe four to five times a week now (no sauce). Don't know if that's good or bad, but I heap the nutritional yeast on it and love it. I'm definitely not a vegan (not that there's anything wrong with that, I just love me meats), but I feel good that this product is so full of nutrients. I don't know how it compares to other brands. I bought this brand first and it tastes great to me, plus the price is cheaper than some others out there, so I figure, why buy anything else?"
2,It's NOT the FIRST book. Prelude to the Foundation is--AND IT'S NOT AVAILABLE ON KINDLE.,"The first book in the series is NOT Foundation. It's Prelude to Foundation. It's not available on Kindle. That's why they're lying to you, so you'll buy the one they DO sell.How's this for an idea, AMAZON: Just start selling Prelude to the Foundation on Kindle! Everyone's happy!"
2,Rock out with your Rice Cooker,"I love this rice cooker. I mean it. My wife and I are doing really well but if this rice cooker decided to come alive I would totally drop everything else just to be with it. It plays music when you set the timer and again when the rice is done. Even kung fu ninjas would bow in respect to this awesome rice cooking machine. Oh and did I mention that it can keep your rice warm and edible for DAYS at a time?!! And it seriously cooks all kinds of rice. I bet it could even cook magic space rice from the planet Nublargorwidspritezensploog. It's about time I get going. My tasty, warm, day old rice is waiting for me.... mmmmm rice"
2,Good Inside look at the U.S. Open,"The author does a great job of taking the reader inside the historic 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black, and includes all the main players involved. Be advised that the book does not focus much on the action at the Open, only the last 75-100 pages deal with the actual championship, the rest involves the story behind bringing the championship to the club. The book is a good read and will be enjoyed by any golf fan, not the best Feinstein has ever written, but one of his best."
2,Some Hits/Some Misses,"Clay Aiken has an amazingly awesome voice. He can be powerful and passionate, playful, rocky, and sensitive and soulful.Hits:InvisibleTouchPerfect DayThe WayNo More Sad SongsRun To MeMisses:I Will Carry You-This song has a good message, but it's lost in the monotonous tempo and forgettable sound. It's a very boring and unmemorable song.Shine-This song has the worst lyrics of them all. ""Hey Butterfly, open your weary eyes"". It totally drowns out Clay's voice and makes him sound like someone he is not.Possible Hits:I Survived YouMeasure of a ManWhen You Say You Love me"
1,Coffee Never Hot Enough,"My coffee cup just barely fit on the plate. I thought I would try a different manufacturer of mug warmers. I already had one that worked. Both products worked the same. I realize that the voltage has a limit on it, but it just doesn't keep the coffee hot enough unless you can drink your cup of coffee in 30 minutes. I sip on mine for 2 hours and get very tired of continually having to zap the coffee in the microwave just to heat it up while still using the coffee warmer.Can the manufacturer's come up with a better idea that actually works?"
2,It fit my Honda Prelude perfectly,"I have a lightweight Fuji road bike and had no problems installing this rack on my 01 Honda Prelude. I do NOT have a spoiler. One reviewer stated that this rack will ruin my paint, but I must have a thousand coats of wax on my Lude and don't expect any problems. NOTE: I took Anthony's advice (the guy in NY with the BMW) and bought rubber tape at Lowe's and wrapped the clips."
2,Disturb not the dream,I have read this book several times. Loved it everytime. Best book I have EVER read!
1,Hell didn't break loose- it barely struck a match!,"It took exactly 100 pages for this book to even begin to be interesting! Ms. Spencer had a tendency to go on and on spatting what seemed to be her own opinions, and voicing them through Greg, her main character. While this can be good, her voice should not smother that of her characters. I thought Shreese's character was too the extreme. She just seemed like a stereotype. It was not until further into the book that you can see she is a true person rather than a stock character. It was a slow read that did not pick up until page 100!! From then on, I was just waiting for something to happen. The climax was smooth and well written, and the book closes giving you, the reader a sense of closure as well. It was refreshing since the beginning was so stale! Spencer used stereotypes instead of modeling her characters after real people. It is almost as though this book was written by two different people. This book should have gone unpublished."
1,Bait and switch at its worst,"The product I received in no way resembles the Vanilla Fields cologne I've been buying for years. The bottle is not the same, but more important, the fragance is unfamiliar, and malodorous. Caveat emptor."
1,"Rambling, boring, and confusing","Some interesting parts to this novel, but it drags on much too long and does not translate into a good American read. Sorry, Oprah!Paragraphs can last for pages and everyone has the same names--Aureliano, Ursula, Segundo, Aradio, and Remedios. Heck, one Aureliano had 17 sons who were ALL named Aureliano. so, often times the reader cannot tell who Marquez is referencing without looking at the family tree graphic in the front of the book.Maybe I am not a deep thinker, but I found this book to be ponderous. And the story lines that are somewhat interesting are never are made clear as to their importance to the overall tale."
1,Disappointed with the sound quality,"If you buy concerts on DVD because of the great sound, skip this one. I was amazed that George Martin and all those experienced players allowed such an amateurish recording to happen. Some of the performances were disappointing: Mark Knoffler seemed to be drunk and/or on autopilot, Paul McCartney made my throat sore hearing him attempt to hit high notes that he can't quite manage anymore."
2,Great Product,"Product is light weight, comfortable, and works well to provide a level working surface on your lap while allowing the laptop to get sufficient air flow."
1,Special Features Suck !!!!,"I gave this movie a 5 out of 5 cause the movie itself is awesome. Absolutely just amazing...BUTI had to give the special features a 1 out of 5 casue they suck.Thats just the only way to describ them. There NOTHING of intrest really. Just some intreviews with people about the movie, some other crap about underwater life and stuff. ABSOLUTELY NO SPECIAL FEATURES about spongebob, NO SPECIAL FEATURES for Kids. They would HATE these lame excuses for special features..... nothing interesting or fun at all.Boo to everyone who had imput on this DVD for the spcial features, they really droped the bomb on it !!!!"
1,Doesn't work with either of my dogs....,We have two Bernese Mountain dogs. Niether will use this collar. They fight to get it off the entire time. Tugging on it does not get their attention. PetCo also expects you to just mail items back with no documentation. Return for this is not handled by Amazon...
2,A Powerful Romance To Stir Your Soul,"The Call of the Canyon is another of Zane Grey's ""war novels"" which is to say, it deals with the subject of the mistreatment of returning veterans from the first world war. But it is also the coming of age of a modern ""sophisticated"" woman who learns the real meaning of love, and what it means to love someone. The story has several scenes which take place in New York City as well as at Oak Creek Canyon in Arizona. For pure romance, this book can not be beat. Carly Birch is one of Zane Grey's finest female characters, and again I will say he often wrote from the woman's point of view which is why the vast majority of his work was published in the leading ""women's"" magazines of the day, and his readership was more than half women. So, ladies, please don't dismiss Zane Grey as a ""western"" writer; he was so much more than that."
2,works great,I use this to listen to ear buds at work but the computers are hidden under the desk so this allows me to have access to the jack. i can move around my cubicle with ease with these.
1,"Eat away diabetes ""Yuk""",the book was easy reading with some interesting facts.But...the recipes were not very palatable. I gave the muffins I baked to the birds because they tasted like bird food and the rest of the dishes I tried to feed to the dog.I do not recommend this book.There are more out there with more information about diabetes and better recipes.
2,Funny!,"I bought three copies of this book as funny Christmas presents, and they were a big hit. One of the people I gave it to, just after opening it, began to read several small sections aloud to the rest of us, and it was very entertaining."
2,20 oz stainless steel frothing pitcher,I bought this item based on reviews and i have been happy with my purchases doing it this way. The stainless steel frothing pitcher is very nice. I find it is the right size for a 16 oz coffee drink. I noticed the construction is very sturdy and it is a nice weight. Not at all cheap. i would highly recommend this product.
2,Totally addictive,Loving this series. Best books ive read for a long time. All six books keep u hooked and wanting more
2,pure hardcore thrash,"If you want a pure hardcore 80's thrash sound then this cd is for you.It sound like they locked the producer out of the studio and then recorded. It's pure, raw, agressive and (for the time when it came out) nasty.The fore-runners of the 80's thrash scean. Taking the best from both the thrash and punk genra. Unfortunate for all that they didn't recieve the recomendation that they deserved."
1,A Complete Rip-off,"You know those First Aid kits you get from the dollar store? The ones in the small, white plastic box? Well, those are better than this. Why? Well, for $8, I'll list what you get.-A white plastic box, measuring 5"" X 4"" X 1-1/2""-Eight plastic bandages, 1"" X 3-1/4"" (bootleg BandAids)-Four 2"" X 2"" gauze pads.-Four BZK towelettes.-Two single-use packs of 1% hydrocortisone cream.-Two two-tablet packsets of aspirin (325mg each tablet)-Two two-tablet packets of acetaminophen (325mg each tablet)-Roll of breathable tape, 1/2"" wide by 72"" long.-Gauze roll, 2-1/2"" wide by 24"" long.-Pair of low-quality bandage scissors.This kit isn't compact, isn't cheap, and doesn't even have good contents. Buy the dollar store kit, add some extras to it, and you'll be more prepared for less money than this kit. And it will be smaller."
1,Poor Facsimile,"This reprint is a facimile of the original edition, but is poorly reproduced. It is a print-on-demand edition, and the original was scanned in halftone mode so that all the text has a dot-screen pattern making it uncomfortable to read."
2,On a trip,"The 2nd book, was very good. I preferred the story line in the wilderness of NY, but it was a swashbucklingly good story in itself. I like the characters that where brought in. Just wish kindle made it clearer that these books are part of a series, and which one comes after the other."
2,HAPPY,the discs all worked well and the case was in good shape. the retailer was very helpful in shipping it to me.
2,Excellent quality,This shoe is exactly what my son wanted. The quality much better than cheaper versions. This is the real converse shoe
2,Changed my running and my life!,"I can truly say that this has made my running more enjoyable, more pain-free, and much more of a learning experience than just a way to suffer through exercise. I've applied it's principles to other areas of my life as well, including biking at the same cadence I'm running (180 bpm for me)."
2,this has got to be the best book ive ever read,"i read this book a little over a year ago when i was 14, this book was so good and it was told like a story not just from some 3rd person view, i felt like i was in the books world it was that good, this book kept getting more and more intriging as i turned the pages i think if i remeber correctly i finshed the book in 4 days, cause it was so damn good... i hella recomend this book to everyone, pretty scary too and i liked the pictures"
2,Goofy Goobers,"You know you've seen a movie such as this too long when you're caught by your co-workers humming the Goofy Goober theme song. Frankly, I hate the Goofy Goober theme song but it's catchy and gets lodged in my cranium whether I want it to or not.The movie was pretty funny, my kids sure enjoyed it more than me. Dennis(the one Plankton hired to take out Spongebob and Patrick) was by far my favorite character. Tough and ruthless, he added a good counterpart to the craziness that is Spongebob and Patrick. Sort of reminiscent of the Tattletale Strangler ony edgier. And if you parents know what I'm talking about, you've probably seen too much of Spongebob as have I.The scene near the end with David Hasselhoff, well, I didn't really care for that. But most of the movie was enjoyable. For kids it's great. They'll watch it over and over."
1,Not as advertised!,"I used to use the more expensive Pampers Cruisers but thought I'd try the Baby-Dry to save some money. I bought a pack at a local store first to make sure the fit and performance was good. I liked them just fine. Nice stretchy tabs, much like the Cruisers. So I ordered from Amazon. I ordered three cases to take advantage of a promotion Amazon was running. But the diapers I received must be old stock, before Pampers put the ""flex"" stretchy sides on the Baby-Dry diapers. The older expiration dates on the Rewards code confirms this. Maybe they've gotten rid of the old stock; then those newer diapers would rate 4.5 stars. These non-flex diapers barely close to fit my baby whereas the flex ones were plenty big. It irks me that Amazon posts a picture of the ""flex"" diapers and delivers a different,inferior product."
2,Such a good classic,This classic is full of inspiration. It should be a must read for ever high schooler in America. It is one of the essential readings for understanding the heart of the total American experience.
1,Disappointment is mine,"I am mad at myself for wasting ten bucks on this book! The plot was slower than a turtle swimming in a pool full of yogurt. The characters were boring and I never felt any connection to any of them. The zombies were equally as boring. I grew weary of the snarky way the characters were in the beginning, when they were all still in the one depressing building together. I expected things to pick up after Emma, Mike and Carl struck out on their own but that didn't happen either.One of the best series I've read (zombie themed) was the ""As the World Dies"" trilogy by RhiannonFrater. Those books were fast paced, full of action and intrigue and the characters were interesting. Plus it also made you think about how mankind really WOULD react if some similar apocalypse occurred. I CARED about the characters in that story and immediately downloaded the second and third books in this series after reading the first. I WON'T be doing that with the ""Autumn"" series."
1,Waaaaay too much in this book for a mere 350 pages,"This book needed to be, in my opinion, at least two hundred pages longer to fully explore all the ideas that were brought up. I liked how it was written and all the cameos by other famous vampires/historical figures, but what I didn't like was the ending. The killer I thought was a real let down, as was how he was eventually caught. And the way Dracula was presented at the very end....ugh. Not good at all.I guess if you're really bored and desperately want to read a vampire novel, this will do. Otherwise, steer clear of this book."
1,Following in Peter Jackson's foot prints?,"This pisses me off,what a burn! I knew this came out in theaters in 3D. You find in the case a coupon for the 3D version coming out ""Soon!"" Bite me Paramount. I'm taking this back for my money. Keep the coupon. What am I suppose to do with this combo after I buy the next? You and Peter Jackson must share the same marketing people."
2,Excellent Writing My Literary Sistah!!,"I just finished reading When ALl Hell Breaks Loose, and I must say I was deeply impressed with the writing and creativity displayed by Ms. Spencer. Her characters were exciting and three dimensional and her words seemed to leap off the page and electrify my mind! I particularly loved her male character Greg, and the fact that she wrote so well from a male perspective. I predict great things are on the horizon for you, sister Camika, and I am happily spreading the word about your talent and strong literary voice. You were wonderful to indulge us with a few paragraphs in Philly, and I look forward to reading CUBICLES. Peace and blessings!"
1,Meandering and pointless,At least it has the saving grace of being short. Our two heroes wander aimlessly from adventure to adventure in a series of dull vignettes.
1,Astrology: Sign of a Artist suffering from His own Idenity,"while Brian Mcknight knows what His Zodiac Sign is&the Month He was born in,musically He is truly suffering from idenity Loss. somewhere between the early 80's till early 90's is where Mcknight is swimming in. while He is a Very talented vocalist,Multi Instrumentalist&songwriter it's been quite a while since He has left a mark.on this set He can't make up his mind if He wants to Be R.kelly,Ronald Isley,Prince,&Others.as long as Brian Mcknight has Been around you would think He wouldn't still be trying to find His Own Musical Idenity but going by this Album he truly is spinning in Music Circles&no direction appears in sight. this Cat should be alot further in His Career than he is."
2,Palm TX Armor case is okay but...,"The case is attractive, built like a tank, and the Palm TX fits easily and snugly inside. Though reasonably slim, naturally it does take up more space in your pocket. Since it's hinged like a book, you end up holding it like one- on your lap or a table. You can't leave it in the case if you use an after market cradle to charge/synch your Palm TX. Though the original Palm TX cover is rather skimpy, think of it as a bikini i.e. comfortable & covers the basics. The Armor case might be better for travel and rough environments."
2,"Great EJ, BJ. Beatles Keyoard books","I just received the three books and they are great. As you progress reading and listening to what you play, you can recognize their notes (BJ, EJ, Beatles) as actually performed. Great to see how those songs come out from your hands and piano!!!But..Song for Guy is missing!!! May be in a next edition. They are worth your money."
1,surprising inaccuracies,"An interesting concept containing a series of stumbling blocks that impede the reader's progress down the Brokaw path. Examples: In dealing with both the Womens Army Corps (WAC) and the United States Army Air Corps, Brokaw consistently mis-names the units. The Army Air Corps was NOT the Army Air Force. The WAC began with the WAAC - Womens Army Auxillary Corps- which converted (with the necessity of WAAC members being sworn into the Army), and became the Womens Army Corps. Brokaw consistently and incorrectly refers to it as the WACs -both in the text and in the index on page 412 of the book. I also wondered how the editor had managed to ignore the structure of a sentence on page 190... ""Lieutenent Settle spent the rest of the war supervising medical technicians at the hospital with no difficulties."" My flow of reading was too often impeded by technical error."
1,Good for younger readers,"[Written by my daughter] At thirteen and a half years old, I read some of these stories laughing at the end because they were so pathetic. I fail to see the gore in here. There are no descriptions at all, and the plots are uncreative. If I were younger perhaps I would enjoy it more. So if you are looking to get this for someone under fourth grade, by all means, they will enjoy it. But for those who prefer real, set up and descriptive horror, get a Steven Kind book or something. Of course, this is coming from a girl who is read stories about women who kill their husbands with lamb chops and then feed it to the detectives, but, you know, that doesn't make the book any scarier."
1,Christian-based philosophy!,"If you're not seeking religious advice for your anger management, be warned that this book is by and for Christians, and published by one of the largest Christian publishing houses. You won't find this mentioned on the back cover or the table of contents, but all of the chapters have to do with Christian spirituality. Can come as a surprise if you were just looking for some secular communication tips and self-soothing techniques!"
2,So far so good!,"The scooter has a good looking, the bateries last up to 45 minutes of continuos use but, need to change fuses evry long ride or every charging process, so far so good!"
2,Pampers are the best!!!!!!!!!,Great product at a great price plus free shipping! Doesn't get any better than that! I have worked in daycare for 11years now and still claim pampers to be the best brand out there for diapers and wipes!P.S. I'm also a mom:)
1,Light Speed Super Pack,"Light Speed Biology: Super Pack - This will be the best buy for extremely cheaper price, instead of buying 5 separate dvds and spending $3 for each package."
1,Hard Times,"I picked up Hard Times preparing to enjoy it since Charles Dickens is my favorite author. While not going so far to say that I was disappointed,I will say that it was the first Charles Dickens novel that I almost felt like not finishing. Not only is the plot rather humorless, but the characters are charmless and almost uninteresting. If it hadnt been written by Dickens then I may have liked it better but as it was it did not have any of Dickens usual charm and humor."
2,The 4 agreements everyone should live by,This book is great and the 4 agreements are inspirational and thought provoking. We spend so much time not respecting ourselves and others and this book takes us to a place to see what is really important. I loved the book so much I bought the CD to listen to in my car and Ipod.
2,True Education,"A book that should be read by all high school students, Butch Jones' autobiography presents a wealth of accumulated knowledge. It is a lesson in economics, philosophy, and Detroit history. Butch Jones, supreme teacher and urban philosopher, turns learning into a game."
2,Informative,"Read it all of it. can not say that I will use any of it. As a woodsman we usually go out already prepared and with our own more modern and durable gear. maybe if I were to live out there and have to replace my goods as they will inevitable need replacing with the suggestions in this book, but seeing as I am a working class man and will not live n the woods it just is good reading and that is all."
1,Stay away from this printer,"I also have been a long time Canon printer user, but decided to try this HP after a co-work said she had such good luck. Not a good idea.The printer would not print envelopes, kept giving me the error message that it did not recognize the paper size. It would not print labels, gave the same error message.Just printing normally it would tell me there was a paper jam.I'm glad I returned the printer before I had to buy ink for it.I just purchased a Canon, can't wait for it to get here."
1,New design- Bad change,"I have used the baby dry diapers for months now. The last two boxes I have recieved do not have as much of the blue absorbant material and the diapers are overall totally different (almost flat). Although the diapers worked well for awhile, the new design leaves much to be desired."
1,The Stench,"I just used this product for the first time and will be returning it.The cheap cologne smell is inescapable. Wash your face with this stuff and you'll be smelling it all day.I popped the top and smelled it at the store, but after using it the smell is much stronger."
2,Love these diapers!,"We have tried different diapers, but Pampers seem to be the best. They are soft, keep our baby dry and happy, and the velcro tabs are the best! I highly recommend them."
1,Dismal,"I hated this dismal movie. Not completely, of course. Diane Lane, the villa, Italy and the builders are lovely, but the story is dismally surreal. First you have the divorce, then the lesbian couple, then a gay tour bus, then some promiscuous italians, then more breakups, then a nice pormiscuous fellow writer. Yuck. There is no romance in this movie - this is not romantic, it's a biological and twisted tale of some womens pre-menopausal angst and bedroom problems. And as if her bedroom problems weren't enough, we get everbody else's too. What happened to nice normal romantic comedys in the Audrey Hepburn style?"
1,Crashed within 3 hours of first use - needs new firmware !!,"This POS started giving ""English font only"" and ""download new firmware from ""www.creative.com"" within 3 hours of using it after it was fully charger. Creative has NO firmware upgrade for this model since it is so new, and support cannot help. Search for ""rhomba firmware"" at google and visit Creative's European customer support forum page - there are oodles and oodles of Europeans with this same fatal error that they cannot recover from at all. People are throwing around unreleased firmware in that forum for this thing since Creative still has not released it. *sigh* another bug-ridden thing from Creative. Going back for the iPod 10GB - $100 upgrade, but I am sure I will have NO problems making that thing work since it is an Apple."
1,A little disappointed...,"Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? Sure, it was an original idea and the revelation of how Jude died was surprising, to say the least. Still, it was very slow-moving and even though Ray Whinstone was very good and Jude Law looked as hot as ever, there wasn't much else to hold my attention. The female leads all acted as if this were the first time they had read their lines - Sadie Frost, in my opinion, was terrible! Surely they could have found some actresses who would show a little emotion and seem sincere when they did show a little emotion. So, I give this film kudos for such an original idea and the unique way in which it was filmed and presented, but otherwise, I have to give it two thumbs down :-("
2,Love it!,"I love Lisa's KettleBell Bombshell video and I can't wait to get volume 2. She is so great at explaining technique. I like how she doesn't do a whole lot of talking during the workout--that is what the intro is for (learning the exercises). Her workouts are doable and you chose how hard you want to workout by increasing reps or weight. I only wish there was more focus on core workout. Overall, awesome workout and definitely not boring. KettleBell's + Lisa Rock!"
2,Pretty Darn Good Stuff,"I confess, I was somewhat skeptical of the talents of a 14 yr. old girl...but I pretty much had my socks blown off when I heard Stacie's CD. It's a great listen, and will have you dancing in front of your mirror and singing along after the first listen-through. The catchy lyrics and R&B rhythms are fantastic and the songs really reflect well the conflicts of a teenage girl who has a relationship with God...she's not just singing about stuff she can't relate to. I'd recommend this to anyone."
1,Dead cold element makes no coffee.,"This machine looks good and made good coffee for about a year. The dripstop mechanism was very tempermental and did not always work well, causing big messes on the counter if we did not watch it carefully. However, that will no longer be a problem as the heating element died today. I have older coffee makers that still work after 20 years. This was a BIG disappointment."
1,Copyright BEFORE reading...,"Single in Saudi is a complete work of FICTION! It says so in the copyright. I have made that mistake before so now I always check to see if it is fictional or is a true event or sadly ...true EVENTS! If you like autobiographical books or biographical as I do, always look for the copyright. Also, get the sample first. If you do not like fiction then you need not pay for it!!"
1,Slingback sandals,Was not happy - shoes did not fit as stated (fit very small) and were very narrow for my feet.
1,Horrible,"This is my first Jack Higgins book and it will certainly be my last. Especially if, as the reviews state, it is the best Higgins book in a long time.The characters are never developed. The way the book begins, you think that the Rashid's are the good guys, and Dillin is the bad guy. Then all the sudden, without developing the characters, the roles are switched. You end up not caring who dies (and 6 billion people die in this book...a little overkill) and who lives.The ""adventures"" are similar to Dora the Explorer in how boring they are. They are very predictable, and of course, Dillin is killing 50 people and no one can kill him. Just ridiculous scenes.Don't get this book, despite the ""reliablity"" of the author."
2,Never cease to AMAZE me,"OK! Sugar Rush was never my favorite song, but this CD has increaced my enjoyment of this song like 50000%!1. Sugar Rush- Like I said, not my favorite A*Teens song2. Sugar Rush (Earthboun's Sugarcrush mix Short)- O my gosh! Earthbound has taken a slower song and made it one of the BEST techno song i have ever heard!3. Sugar Rush (Earthbound's Sugarcrush mix Long)- As i have said in other interviews, this song only gets better as it gets longer!4. Sugar Rush (M 12 Mix)- Can you say, ""The Best remix EVER!"" It's like dance style, and the best. I can't say that enough!"
1,not a good fragrance,"After taking an internet perfume quiz and falling into the 'Bohemian' catagory, it was suggested I may like this scent. Oh God... it is horrible. It doesn't just smell like ""Dirt""... a nice earthy ""I've been gardening"" scent... it smells like dirt from a landfill. The clerk laughed when I actually gagged."
2,Stunning!,"Zelia and her crack band celebrate a yearlong alliance by recording one of their ""rehearsals"" at the Cultural Center in Rio. Beautifully filmed and edited (except for some frontal shots of Zelia where the camera seems to shake), this DVD was recorded one years after the CD of the same name. It's fascinating to hear how the songs evolved after a year of working together. So many highlights, I can't even begin...but will simply mention that Zelia is in top form and wearing a beautiful dress!Just check it out--you'll be glad you did! Maravilhosa!!!Beleza, Zelia!!!!!"
1,A movie or a music video??,"What is it where a director has so little confidence in his own work, that he has to fill in whatever blanks he perceives with incessant music?? I mean, it is non-stop music throughout almost all the movie. When you find yourself fastforwarding to get to the meat of the story, you know you have a loser."
2,CLAY is FANTASTIC!!!!,What a GREAT cd!!! I love listening to Clay over and over and over again!! WOW!!! Great job!!!! Thank you so much for making this cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Stability Ball,I had absolutely no trouble pumping this ball. I'm 71 and had it inflated in a few minutes. It has not lost air at all. This ball is very sturdy.
1,formatting and grammar...where is it?,"I have to admit that I have real problems with books that lack editing. This is a case in point. This book is difficult to read because of all the grammatical and spelling errors. Misplaced modifiers abound, too. Perhaps these errors have been corrected in subsequent printing, but at least, the one that I read had multiple errors on nearly every page. By the way, what is with spaces between paragraphs?Living on the North Coast as I do, I understand that people living in Ohio might find the story intriguing because of the subject matter; however, I found it difficult to enjoy the story because of the stilted conversations and implausible situations."
2,Another great read if you're a die hard rock and roll fan...,"Ben Fong Torres life , as a young editor for Rolling Stone Magazine and his life of interviews for. 20 + yearsIs an easy read and a must read if you're truly a rock and roll fan..."
1,Pure Rated Garbage.(PRG),"THIS IS NOT A GREAT ALBUM. RAY-J LACKED A WHOLE LOT. MY SISTER WASTED HER MONEY, WE ALL DON'T LIKE IT, FIRST ALBUM IS MUCH BETTER. SECOND, I DON'T KNOW. ""WAIT A MINUTE"" WAS HOT. I WOULDN'T TAKE THE LAST COPY OFF THE SHELF. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO AN R & B FAN. THE ONLY SONG ON THERE IS HOT ARE "" WHAT I NEED"" ""BLUE HIGH HEELS"" AND ""ONE WISH""."
2,Weekend Excursion Fan Wowed!,"This has to be my favourite WE album. Sam has a great voice & the music is poppy, yet keeps things rocking. These guys are as awesome in concert as in your CD player. Get up & dance!"
2,Ms. Farvour Read HERE!!,"John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is a short, but entertaining novel. The book takes place in the 1930's with the 2 main characters John and Lennie traveling to a ranch to work, save up money and live their dream. Lennie is a big guy that is a little slow in the mind, and has an obsession with petting soft things. George is a small guy that has known Lennie for a long time and gives him commands for Lennie doesn't know what to do by himself. Much like a Father-son relationship.I usually don't like fiction tales that take place in the past,but I enjoyed this one. The only problem is that the book starts out slow. It gives you clues that keeps you guessing and wondering.For all you readers that consider yourself a slow reader, this is a great book for you. It's exciting and short. Only 107 pages. The price on the book is 8 bucks. I think it's worth it."
2,So far So good!,"I have an office that is a decent size, on the smaller size- but has a very large window and thin walls so it is arctic cold at times. I purchased this heater based on the reviews and the remote control...the remote is great, as is the safety feature. I have only had it a couple of days, but so far I am very happy. I have the thermostat cranked up as high as it will go and the heater on the highest setting and its so quiet I can barely tell its running. My office heats up so quickly my coworkers have been stopping by to warm up!FYI: if the safety button on the back is not pushed in, your heater won't operate. I thought mine was broken until I found this out..."
2,Awesome!!!,"I purchased these for work and they lasted FOREVER! i basically wore them every day. I did finally have to throw them out because they got woren out and my feet started to get cold on the bottom from living in Minnesota, haha. But i would def buy these again!!!!!"
2,"Make a copy for your car, and load it in your i-Pod.",This is one that you can leave on in the background all day and never get tired of hearing scenes from the movie.
1,Felt as tho it was made of plastic.,"I recommend this product to no one because it was essentially plastic. It felt like it was throw together in and hour. The ""metal part"" bends too easy as it will break. If you want to truly cosplay, this is not the right headband. I tried bending it to make it look like my cosplay and it was terrible."
2,VERY HARD TO FIND 1982 RELEASES! BUT VERY GOOD ONES!,"I remember living in Inkster, MI on Parkwood Avenue and my friend Rod would be bumpin' this 1982 release every day. ""My Favorite Person"" had all the classic flavor of the O'Jays. Itwas probably their last classic Philly sound release as the problems Philadelphia International would have with CBS Records wouls eventually set in and a move to EMI would be forthcoming. ""Your Body's Here With Me"" is the signature cut on this reissued double album but ""My Favorite Person"", ""I Just Want To Satisfy"", and ""One On One"" were classic cuts as well. ""When Will I See You Again"" dropped great songs with their own version of the classic Three Degrees hit. Check out ""I Can't Stand The Pain"". These two albums are probably the hardest to find of all of the O'Jays albums besides the ones released on the TSOP(The Sound Of Philadelphia) label. PICK THIS ONE UP BECAUSE ITS NOW ON 1 CD!"
2,dolly can do no wrong,"This cd blew my mind the second i listened to it! Dolly knows country like no other and this hould be a lesson to all those tired pop-country acts cramming the airwaves: this is how to do country, bluegrass and any kind of roots music for that matter. her rendition of ""Silver Dagger"" gives me chills. she is just the queen of country."
2,The Call of the Canyon,I am 73 years old and always loved to read. I read all of Zane Grey books when I was in the 7th grade. It was nice to find them on Kindle and start reading themagain. Thank you Kindle.The Call of the Canyon
2,"Great cd, but.............","First off, I recommend this cd to anyone who likes modern rock. All the tracks are listenable, and I usually go through the cd nonstop. The only problem is that System of a Down isn't all that musical. They tune down their instruments down one step, then just hammer away with no effort. While I do appreciate this album, it doesn't offer that much musical talent."
2,"Never liked the strings, but this blew my socks off","I cought the concert on some very high numbered cable channel. I was so impressed I bought the DVD. This is the most origional idea I've seen in years. Its a cross between Enigma, Petshop Boys, Alan Parsons, ELO, and a conductor on crack. The song Winter is my favorite to date. I predict you find Bond music playing in the background of TV commercials very soon. Seeing them perform is 50% of the show. Just listening will suffice if you have the memory of them performing. Download ""Winter"" or ""Duel"" to get an idea of the pure talent of BOND."
1,Paper feed nightmare ARRRGGGHHH,"I received this printer for Christmas. I had it maybe a month and a half and it would not pull the paper. I tried all the recommendations on HP website and it did not help. I ended up contacting HP tech support. They had me do all these resets, etc. which still did not work. They offered a refurbished one for free so I took it. It was like new but again about a month or two later - SAME PROBLEM. Of course, I did not buy extended warranty so I MANUALLY FEED THE PAPER EVERY TIME. It is a great printer otherwise but I recommend NOT TO BUY THIS PRINTER"
1,Don't waste your money,"These wrist weights began leaking the sandy material on my first use. I bought Bell wrist weights from Amazon a couple of years ago and those have held up wonderfully. Sadly, Amazon doesn't carry them anymore. These Valeo wrist weights are very poor quality. For them to leak the weight material on first use they obviously were not made well. Amazon, you should remove these from your site."
1,As Bad a Production as Possible,"This Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest, most sparkling 18th-century comedies--and ruined it. The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like ""The School for Scandal"" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what? Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD."
2,Devestating,"While the subject of this story intrigued me it also really disturbed me at the same time. I think it was an important read. Big Brother, here we are. I won't say you'll have fun from reading this book but I will say you will learn a thing or two about our world and where we are going."
2,Absorbing and Felt Real,"This absorbing story felt real as I went along, reading it pretty quickly over the course of a few nights. Meg Wolitzer's writing is all-American, a reflection of life here and now. I love it. She's just deep enough to be very interesting, and literary enough to pull you along, but in this book, every word counts. If only every women's author these days was so spare and so talented! It was such a relief to pick up this meaty but relatively short book - 240 pages - after having to plow through big, fat, 500-page, comment-on-every-color-and-nuance-of-thought ""women's literature"" books for my book club!"
2,Good insights,"If you're looking for good insights on criminal behaviour, this is it. I liked it and learned a few things I hadn't already explored."
2,Very good,They came in time. Look fwd for the baby soon! This June will be diaper time for us. The price is very good also.
2,Superb music for relaxation,I bought this CD having previously purchased Nick Kemp's spoken word CDs. The music on this CD takes you on a deeply relaxing journey and is ideal for anyone who wants to destress or simply likes ambient trance style music!
2,Engrossing!,"I was completely lost in this book, the storytelling was captivating! A wonderfully written book that made me want to read Chronicles in the bible! Excellent!!And so now I find I NEED to get the next in the series... I can't handle knowing there is more and not reading them! Good job on marketing - give me the first one free, sell the other four! :) But, if all four of the next as as good as the first - it'll be money well spent."
1,Confusing,who ever wrote this dumb confusing book is in a mental state of mind! Fahrenheit 451 is a overworded description of a fireman who lives on rebellion! It is a bad influence on the young people of the world. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE BURNED!
2,Timeless Classic!,"Through each page, this book carried with it amazing perspectives that transcend time and generations. In terms of the story independent of everything else, it was not very compelling. However, as a piece of literature trying to paint a vision of what happens when communication is no longer valued either verbally or through the pen, it is a classic."
2,Exceeds expectations,This is my 3rd pressure washer and by far the best of the breed. It is solid piece of work that is easy to move about when doing the deck(s)with wheels that actually work. Santa gave me the one with the roll-up hose which is very nice feature. Only problem was that the User guide didn't have any information on this feature so I spent a few minutes trying to figure out where or how to connect the high pressure hose to unit- Guess What? - No need to connect anything except garden hose. I consider this tool the best buy for your $$$$
2,Warp Brothers 3X50 Black Plastic Sheeting,"Purchase this to lay on ground before putting mulch down. Worked great, very heavy plastic, would purchase again. I see this lasting years under the mulch."
2,"If you buy, you will have them all....","If you can't make one of the concerts, you can buy this CD and have the very best of Clay. Granted, he is one of those performers who come across VERY well in concert. You will have the opportunity to skip from Invisible, to The Way, to Touch, to Run to Me, to I Survived You,....the list is endless and if you don't have the opportunity to make a concert....here it is!!! I like this CD because I can let it play all the way through and still be reliving the concert I was just at!!!! Sometimes (as most of his fans know), this is the FIX that gets us through the day. I defy you to go to one of his concerts and not come back wishing and wanting more!!! If you don't believe me, fine, don't buy this CD. He will stand the test of time..."
1,This movie doesnt deserve any stars...,Total mind rape of a movie. This was by far the greatest let down of 2011. I found this movie disrespectful to the true Transformer fans and see this regurgitation as a middle finger from Micheal Bay to all of us. If your a True Transformer fan stay away.
1,Outdated,This was the first book that I bought when I found out that I was expecting twins and I found it to be outdated and full of a lot of biased information. The author has her own thoughts about what type of diet you should eat and advocates natural childbirth but doesn't provide a very comprehensive point of view to assist those that may not want to experience childbirth the way that she has. If you share her views then this book will be very helpful to you.I also tried contacting a lot of resources at the back of the book and found most of the numbers to be disconnected.
2,excelent product!,"This product does what is said in the description, my waist got smaller and I can stand for hours withoutfeeling any pain on my back. My work requires a lot of lifting this product help protect my back. I love it! Is my second buy. The price is also good, the first one I got cost me $55 this time I paid $36 for it."
2,Very Different From Jaffe's Usual,"The first story is a novella, the tale basically of a Holly Golightly type named Melba Toast who uses men for their money, and her female friend and admirer who is not sure she can or wants to become like Melba. This story and the rest of the short ones are quite different from the ones of Jaffe's usual innocent, naive heroine who has limited insight to her own behavior. The tone is more real, the women are more realistic, and the stories are just more well-written overall. I would recommend this book over any other Jaffe book."
2,The Shipping News,"I enjoyed the movie so much and loved the sound track, which I have really enjoyed and would recommend it to everyone who enjoys music with a Celtic sound."
2,the classic quartet at an amazing point in it's existance,"if i could give this album more than a 5 i would. there is really not much to say about it. it is heartfelt, beautiful music and i feel like crying every time i hear it."
2,thank you for paving the way for me,"bryan wilson is da bomb! I am a singer myself and i know good talent when i hear it. and when he sang ""His Eye is on the Sparrow"", it blow me away! He is phenomenal and I love to hear him sing because he feels what he is singing about and what singing really is--the anointing you put into it, not the show so many people try to put on. I wish you much success in the future to come. Maybe I'll get to sing with you when I come out. May God forever bless you in your music ministry! Much love, Your sister in Christ, Connie"
2,Wonderful book,"I love this book, it has different kinds of projects that you'll enjoy, and the charts are neat, I love it!!!!!!"
1,Don't believe the hype,"I WISH I had read the previous review for this book before I bought it. I couldn't put it better myself. I bought this book because it was the only one advertising saturated fat counts. I already have two books that cover everything but saturated fat, and I'm going to keep it that way. I'm returning this book for a refund."
2,Ranchers vs Old Vegas Mob,Great series featuring the beginnings of Las Vegas. Dennis Quaid is delightful as the Sheriff and I gotta love the mobsters too.
2,great scratcher,My cat never took to the traditionaol scratching post. We have used these for years now and I highly recommend it. Initially the catnip drew her to it---now she just loves when her old board gets replaced with a new one.
2,Chicks with Accents in America!,"This movie is a little dated. I am sure it scared the every loving be-jesus out of folks when it came out. That said, its still scary! It will keep your interest thats for sure. Hey- we are talking 6 foxy chicks going into a cave to crawl around. What guys interest does that not hold? Chicks will enjoy the female choas of the group. There are a couple of scenes that will unsettle even the most stone faced horror show movie goer. Oh- the funny thing about this movie is that all the chicks have British accents. Not sure how this happens, but it adds to the charm of these chicks crawling around the cave. ""Is anyone injured?"", vs (American)""Are you OK?"". Its worth buying, and seeing a couple a times."
1,a very poor attempt!!,"This book is basically a bunch of recycled self help ideas tossed at the AA woman under the guise of a catchy title. I didn't make it half way and had to throw it down vowing not to crack the cover of that mess again. That book was rambling and was boring about the same old crap. Man problems, looks, and nothing about real feelings. It's just not my type of book. If you have just gotten out of a bad relationship like this one, then this book is for you. But for those who are not, move on down the cyber shelf!!I heard about this book on different AA hair discussion boards. Those who said it was great, I don't suppose you read much or you only read these types of books. This book is very sad and doesn't deserve the praise it gets."
2,"Simple Book, Simple Stories, Simple Teaching - Nice","Peter Urban was a pioneer in American karate and helped not only spread the art of goju ryu, but the ripple effect helped the promotion of other martial arts as well in the 60s and 70s. While a little eccentric, Urban was true to the bushido roots, while adapting karate for an American population.This book covers karate philosophy in its mid-twentieth century form and promotes the positive aspects of discipline and etiquette. The book deals with attitude and motivation of spirit. The second half of the book has ""dojo stories"" that help embody the essences of karate training.This is just a nice and simple book worth the read."
2,Good instructional DVD/Workout,"IF YOU USE KETTLEBELL WORKOUT DVD'S, YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE ARE TWO GENERAL TYPES. ONE TYPE IS THE TRADITIONAL KETTLEBELL TYPE WITH HEAVIER KETTLEBELLS. GOOD FORM AND AN INSTRUCTOR WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS TYPE OF WORKOUT; AS BAD FORM WILL PROBABLY LEAD TO AN INJURY. THE OTHER TYPE OF KETTLEBELL DVD USES LITTLE MINI KETTLEBELLS AND MORE UNUSUAL TYPE OF MOVES. OFTEN THE INSTRUCTOR SEEMS TO BE A BEGINNER, WITH IMPROPER FORM.I PREFER LISA BALASH'S INSTRUCTION AND WITH A HEAVY ENOUGH BELL YOU WILL NEED LONGER REST BETWEEN SETS.I WILL BE BUYING HER SECOND DVD SOON."
2,Tear jerker,"This was a great story from start to finish as other reviewers have stated. Danny is a waiter at a local restaurant when Ariana and her controlling mother and her companion stop in for lunch. Ariana's mother is controlling of her because Ariana is deaf and feels she needs to make all of her daughter's decisions for her even though she is 21! It is love at first sight for Danny, although Ariana's mother doesn't think Danny is good enough for Ariana and does whatever she can to keep them apart. Kent Moran also performs his own music in this movie which is great! There are a couple more twists to this movie that I don't want to give away. Great tear jerker romance worth having in your movie collection."
1,A toy not made to last,This toy has peaces that fall off even while puting it together it kept falling apart the legs would not stay on and part of the tower would not stay together. I would not recomend this toy to anyone else or pay for it again myself.
2,We Are All Human,"HIT BELOW THE BELT is the true story of a medical doctor's diagnosis of having Prostate Cancer, and his journey of the many twists and turns of seeking treatment for his conditon. A no holds barred book about a very common ailment, that every man over 40 should be required to read, together with their mates. Told in non medical lingo, the book is a fast read."
2,"""El Dorado...as good as gold""","Elton John returns with 11 very seductive tracks on this release. The melodies are strong and he sounds great! Particular stand-outs include ""Someday Out Of The Blue,"" which is the first single, ""Trust Me,"" ""My Heart Dances,"" and ""Friends Never Say Goodbye."" A few more EJ tracks would have been better than the instrumentals included at the end of the album. Overall this is a fine body of work. The first single is probably the catchiest of the songs on this release, and a good follow-up single to this one would be ""Trust Me."""
2,An interesting book about an interesting person,"I found the book to be strange in some regards. Professor Washington seemed to harbor no bad feelings toward any Southerner, or even his former owners. That aside, the book is very interesting. His point of view on slavery and Southern race relations are unlike any other I've heard. Regardless of what another review says, he was definately not a selfish person in any way. He only seemed to care about his school and work, not personal life. He states that he doesnt play any games of any sort. Read this book if you want a refreshing view of post-Civil War race relations."
2,hidekos gift,"My friend Hideko has wanted a new rice cooker for some time now, and she is very happy with the zojirushi rice cooker. She makes rice every day and she just loves it. Thank You Al"
1,Upsetting,I may not a good reviewer because I stopped reading at page 50 but I believe this is not at all a good book to read if you want to learn about Japanese culture. As a Japanese born and raised in Japan I find this book extremely humiliating.
1,Stupid....,Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this. Let alone the story line was ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend!
2,Top-notch story telling and animation,"I bought Veggietales for the kids, but the whole family (ages 9 through 65) have enjoyed the excellent animation, the silly humor, and the great story telling. Great for getting your kids into the Bible, but if that's not your goal, they will enjoy the message and have a lot of fun."
2,Pampers Diapers 222 Count,"Great product and even better price. If you compare to Costco, Target, etc. you will not find a deal better than this."
2,The REAL American Idol!,I knew this CD would be awesome before I got it but I was totally blown away! I can't even describe it. Clay's voice is totally amazing. I would reccomend this CD to everyone....
2,The Most Understated Guitarist of our Time,"Blues Saraceno is nothing short of a demi-god when it comes to musical genius. His approach to music in it's entirety is amazing to say the least. He has replaced my past favorites and now stands proud at the top. While he is fast as Vai and Satriani, his phrasing is majestic. His tone in unprecedented and unmatchable. Surprising to say, Saraceno cut all of these tracks in his own home studio at the ages of 16-23. You will understanding what I am talking about when you hear this albumn. BUY THIS CD!!! REVEL IN ITS BEAUTY!!! SPREAD THE WORD OF BLUES SARACENO!!!"
2,One of Schaeffer's finest moments,"How can a person prove they are a Christian, that their faith is real? This is Schaeffer's question. He seeks Christ's answer and finds it: ""They shall know that you are my followers by the love that you have for one another."" So the defining characteristic of a believer is that they exhibit love toward other believers. Sounds simple enough but it is, alas, terribly hard to live out in real life. In this brief tome, Schaeffer economically explores the mandatory nature of this quality (""As I have loved you, you must love one another"" is pretty imperative), how its neglect dooms the church to skeptical reception at best, and examines how one can cultivate such love for fellow Christians. A very important read from one of the 20th century's most important Christian minds."
1,Understanding,"I believe this book to be completely and inutterably crazy. I dislike it because of its content. Honestly i have read a lot more interesting books. Slowly i start to understand it but barely. Choice of words is what i believe to not be good. I think the story would be and entirely different book if Ray Bradbury would have chosen maybe some words and word phrases that children might understand better. I suggest to read this book if you feel like you have time. If your into all that science fiction stuff then you would probably enjoy this book much more than i ever will in two lifetimes. Goodluck, you might need it!"
2,A pretty Damn Good Book,"This book is so good a great Canadain band called the Tea Party wrote a whole album about it called ""Transmission"". Pick up the book and the CD. They both rock and are a mindasul"
1,Couldn't get into it.,"I'd heard such good things about this book, and couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, I found it really slow. I read the paperback version, and to be honest, I couldn't bring myself to finish the book. Major disappointment."
2,Blade of the Ripper,"The title of this film was originally ""Next"". The film had a great plot and action which kept one on the edge of one's seat.It would be helpful to put the title ""Next"" by the new title so that buyers know that this is the same movie.Sincerely,Terra Schoenberg-JohnsonDave Johnson (husband)"
1,the worst book in the entire night world series!!!,"this is the worst night world book that i owned and im sure every1 agrees this 1 [is bad] alot/ first of all gillian is a stupid little sissy whining girl who cared only bout the stupidest things - being popular and getting her crush david to notice her obvioulsy she wasnt being herself she was just like every1 else- wanting to be popular like it was the most important thing in the world to her thats is very stupid of her 2nd the plot was really stupid and boring and didnt mention any vamps, witches, or shapeshifters or the night world in particular. another reason why this book [is bad] the only part i like is that there's an apppearance by one of my fave characters of the series-ASh i swear he would be more funner 2 read if the book was only bout him!!! angel wasnt a good character either and david [wasn't either]!! i recommend teens 2 not by this book it really stinks alot!!"
1,"DO NOT BUY FROM ""jersey.xray""....","I paid promptly...no item...I wrote them...no response...now I have to figure out how to get my money back. Terrible seller through Amazon...I cannot believe they allow him to do this to so many people. Really would've liked my book. Unfortunately, I cannot leave zero stars...BLAH!"
1,amp,Dont buy this if you want good sound and power! worthless to me for my use! Didn't work worth a DAMN!
1,Interesting ideas poorly communicated,"Galbraith's insight on society unfortunately gets lost in a maze of double negatives and confusing sentence structure. His ideas are sound, though he has a very off-putting pompous delivery. In fact, his verbosity and poor structure is so bad, that it turns what should be a slim read into a fairly mind-numbing experience. The book really needs to go back to an editor."
2,A romantic comedy gem,"Spunky with cheeky humour and wits, Trish Jensen's under-rated gem of a romantic comedy tells of two antagonizing attorneys, Paige Hart and Ross Bennett, who after a court session suffers a bomb blast and are hospitalized, diagnosed with Tibetan Concupiscence Virus that heightened sexual awareness. Their closed proximity forces them to deepen their understanding. Paige's large and comically larcenous extended family as well as a side romance between the doctor and Paige's brother provides first-rate entertainment while we are stuck with the oddball couple in their tension-filled and delightfully emotional romance. Trish Jensen delivers dimensional chracterization through punchy dialogues that are fresh, witty and funny."
2,Spider-Man - The Motion Picture DVD Triology,This item was a gift and I am basing my review on the three movies which I have seen.
1,Counterfit item - but works OK,"According to the Motorola guide, the charger I received is a counterfit: It has a illuminated blue dot rather than a fully illuminated ""M"". It works OK, but should not be represented as made by Motorola."
1,"Terribly, terribly disappointing",Brokaw has managed to take wonderful raw material and produce a book that would not challenge a junior high school student. The book is shallow and banal. I am sorry I wasted my money on it and even sorrier that he will receive it. Surely a man who makes his living with words can do better than this.
1,Too much money for a medicore card,"The card isn't very good and stores pictures too slowly, especialy as you start to fill up the memory. Also SimpleTech's customer support isn't too good. Not one person could tell me what the 'Error Application' message meant when using the Simple Tech CompactFlash Card Reader to get pictures from the card.Stay away from this company."
2,Frasier,A great DVD by Usher; I love his music. The perfromances are great and the songs make you want watch the DVD over and over again. I recommend that you buy this one.
1,Incorrect title,"Okay, I did not buy this product. Nor will I. There has to be something wrong with the title of this video. If they mean little sister, then I think the correct pinyin form of it should be mei mei. Mimi means breast in Chinese. Are all the reviewers of this English only speakers, or has someone who actually speaks Chinese seen this video? I'm just curious if their pinyin is incorrect, then will their pronunciation of words be incorrect as well?"
2,Pleasantly surprised but with reservations,"The is the very first book that I have read by Alan Cook. The book started off slow but didn't remain that way. It was a good fun read. I had issues at certain parts. 1)Tony is a mid 30's male that sometimes is lusting after a soon to be 18 years old female. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Even though their relationship was platonic, her mother not knowing him pretty much allowed him to have free rein with her. 2) What appears to me to be the gratuitous reference to 911. 3) Having a character who has never spoken with, had history or experience with the ""nanny"" in this story allude to a nanny in California being a Spanish speaker. Not all nannies are Spanish speakers. Not all nannies speak Spanish. These are a few of the instances where I shook my head.Overall it's not a bad book. It was fun. I plan to read more by Alan Cook."
2,Pretty Good Flick,"Not so much scary as it is interesting, however some decent performances keep you involved. The story is a little drug out, as this could have been much better at 90 min. as opposed to its 115 min. run time worth seeing never the less."
2,"Optimistic as humans can be, but well thought.","The book was one of the best that I have ever read yet, it is the same mumbo jumbo that humans will always find th right way. That our race will always survive, conqor evils, and destroy evil doers."
2,Sweet movie for preschoolers,"I bought this movie to show our faith- based preschool group when we were studying Native Americans. Although it may not be historically accurate, if you talk about various Native American groups being different vs. stereotyping, I think this is appropriate to show for that age group."
1,Poor Streaming,"Movie was great! The Amazon streaming was horrible. Several times the movie would stop to buffer but wouldn't restart on it's own. Several times we had back up and and restart the movie. Picture quality was good but streaming compared to NetFlix, Hulu etc. Amazon has a long ways to go before I'll buy another movie through your system."
2,A Book You'll Never Forget,"Wow, this book strongly affected me in a positive way. The first 50 pages were okay, because period pieces are not always my favorite. I hung in there since C.S. Lewis is my favorite author. I'm so glad I did because I got hooked. By page 50 I was so engrossed I couldn't put it down. By the last 50 pages I finally understood what the book was REALLY about and finished the book sobbing at 4 in the morning. It's been over ten years since I first read it and I think of it often. It makes you think about your own life and if you are having an impact on those around you for good. Why are we here and what are we doing about it?"
2,My daughter liked it,"While I am not a big fan of this costume, my four year old liked it and that's all that matters. She wore it almost every day before Halloween and she felt so proud to say to others she was going to be a super hero for Halloween. She definitely has enjoyed it, the price was great so I am happy with this purchase."
2,"A decent book, I see somwhat related to 1984",It's a book that basically tells of censorship. It is well written and makes you think about censorship today.
2,"Mom's Happy, I'm Happy","Gave it to mom for a mother's day gift, she's never had a CD player. Figured the light use she'd use it for would be fine, but she's using it daily, falling asleep to it, listening at the beach and home, and loves the sound. So, I've nothing bad to say!"
2,Nineteen Ninety Nine,"This book is as powerful as it was when it was written. The universality of literature in this book is evident. It clearly shows the effects of totalitarianism and a loss of human spirit; this novel shows it almost as well as Anthony Burgess's ""A Clockwork Orange"", which holds the best novel of all time in my esteem"
1,"It really had potential, but....","Although I am an avid Anne Rice fan, I initially bought this book because the back cover proclaimed it to be ""the modern Story of O"". Since Story of O is one of my favorite books in the genre of erotica, I just had to buy it, but then it seems that such sweeping claims hardly ever turn out to be true.... The book starts out strong, with intensely erotic scenes focusing on Lisa and Eliot and the beginnings of an interesting love story, but as the book progresses the characters seemed to become less and less realistic: by the time I finished it, I felt extremely unsatisfied. If you're an Anne Rice fan, this is a good book to read, if just to see how she fares in a genre other than horror, but overall there's much better erotica out there, and this book definitely does not live up to its claim of being as good as the Story of O."
1,too small,"Very hard to put on, they are not very big, and I am a slender petite woman with little hands & wrists, but it feels like I am scraping my skin to get them on and off, do not care to wear them at all. Look nice, built well, but need to make bigger. Going to see if I can return them or resell them myself."
1,fort apache,The movie is old fashioned and not well acted. It was melodrmatic and artificial.The supplier of the DVD was prompt and professional
2,"Still poignant after 64 years...Newspeak, Big Brother, and Orwell","This novel can be read from the left side or the right side of the political spectrum because the overarching horror of the totalitarian state presented by Orwell here is told to us in an honest and forthright manner. Orwell's narrative retains its relevance because we still seem to go through phases where the freedoms of the enlightenment are challenged from many angles. Whether you read Big Brother as Joseph Stalin or Sam Walton and The Party as being representative of a fascist or communistic authoritarian State, the ""truth"" of this novel, that liberty, personal freedom, and the freedom to speak and be understood are ideals that should be treasured and protected in practice. As long as there are human beings who wish to control and eradicate the humanity of others, 1984 will remain a novel worth reading."
1,poor,"I was not happy with pampers diapers. I was using huggies before and after I switched to pamper, there were more leakage accidents. Plus the side wings broke couple of time while putting on diapers. So overall I was not happy with the pampers this product. I had used pampers with my first child few years ago and they were fine."
2,Measure of a Man by Clay Aiken,"This album is all we have been waiting for and can be listened to by all. I bought enough to give for gifts and didn't even wait for giving them out, just had to let everyone hear them NOW. All the ages, from pre-teen up to this older lady love this man, Clay Aiken and his high ideals show through. We appreciate as fans what he has done, to make his album family friendly as he did the Idol show on tour. This is a Star, make no mistake. He will be the greatest along in a world that has ruined music for anyone that wants to hear actual music. Listening to some of the things on radio is just too darn tedious, as some is just noise and other is plain garbage. Not so with Clay Aiken's music. Thank God for Clay Aiken."
1,He's not quite there yet...,"Apart from some reasonable songs (One Wish - Track 4, War is Over Track 8), I really didn't feel like this album was all there. To be honest I haven't really taken the time to listen to most of the tracks & in hindsight I wouldn't have bought this CD. His talent is clear but a little more tweaking at the studio may be warranted!"
1,Bob Hoskins and Dennis Hopper deserve Oscars,"for being in this movie. Not because their acting was great, but because they managed to get through the whole thing without having a ""how much money am I getting paid for this? How much money am I gettting paid for this?"" expression on their face. In a way it's too bad that this movie, and Mortal Kombat failed at the box office as it prevented other video game classics such as PacMan, Centipede and Joust from being made into live action movies. Darn the luck."
1,"""Deceased!!!""","After spending many years watching the witty repartee and sight gags of the Trinity series I had hopes that ""Boot Hill"" would continue in this vein. What I got was a very hard to follow and sadly, very boring, spaghetti Western. Few, if any, redeeming moments. I wish Terrence Hill, upon reading the script to this turkey, would have done some Trinity slaps on the director and/or screenwriter."
2,'The best laid schemes of mice and men; go often wrong',"I'm not going to give you a summary of this story, as you'll find many on this page. I'll tell you this, though, buy this book in the store, they're overcharging for it here. And aside from that, this book *is* wonderful. I had to read the first chapter for school and read the rest on my own. The imagery is vivid and all of the characters, from the least important to the main two, Lennie and George, breathe a life of their own. Another good one by John Steinbeck is 'The Pearl.'"
2,I love this product,"I have been searching the product like this for long time,I got one. The important feature are pronounciation and quickfind. Just by mouse over the word you can find out the meaning."
1,A typical anti-Darwinism pseudoscience book,"The book contains 280 pages of text, 25 pages of refenreces, 7 pages of INDEX, and many figures and cartoon to explain the concept of author's hypothesis. Barbieri was a development biologist at MRC in Cambridge, NIH, and Max Planck.This is a typical anti-Darwinism semi-pseudoscience book. I picked up the book because the book cover had a Chomsky's accolade. It's not as obvious and outrageous as Intelligent Desing-sort of book, but the author cites his own book to explain his main points. Many biological facts in the book are real and correct, but there is no scientific logical structure to support the author's ""semantic"" theory. I was struck by the fact that this book was published from Cambridge University Press."
1,Not My Cup of Tea,"I felt like I was reading an anthropology book, which may be appealing to some readers, but wasn't what I was looking for."
2,Outstanding Book,"From the persective of a U.S. Army Officer, I highly recommend this book. Mr. Hoiback does an excellent job, in a very concise manner, to describe the linkage between Authority, Intent, and Dissemination of command. He then uses two case studies that show the relationships in the real world.I really appriciated the second case study showing the opening days of WWII in Norway. The case study told the story of COL Erickson who took the initiative to sink a German Cruiser amid the cowardice of the politicians and the inadequate preparations to maintain Norway's neutrality; a story I never read before this book. I would recommend reading the second case study before the first case study discussing the GEN Haig in the First World War. By reading the Second Case study first, I believe that case study one will be easier to follow.Eric"
1,"Horrible game! Hard to understand and follow, bad graphics",We got this game for our 7 year old when xbox still had so few little kids games. This is the worst game we have ever purchased. It is hard to figure out...hard to play...and hard to see what you are doing. It just feels like pushing all kinds of buttons until the game ends.Also...many levels that my daughter would want to play are 'locked' and the game is so hard to win that she will never get to play them.The game has been collecting dust since the 1st week we bought it.
1,A major dissapointment,"I am a huge science fiction fan and heard from many people that this is one of the ultimate Sci-fi classics. So, I decided to read it. I was very dissapointed. Though some concepts were fairly interesting they were not developed, so book had no point. I cannot understand why this novel is as famous as it is. Do not waste your time reading Fahrenheit 451."
2,Worth your time and very enjoyable historical (biblical) novel,"Got this as a free Kindle read and so glad I did. This was one you did not want to put down and felt as if you were there in the scene, as you were drawn into the story. I liked that it was not repetative, as some writers will repeat points already made. The story was fast moving, engaging, and certainly of interest. A true test of any good book is if you want to read the next in the series and I'm there."
1,not very good,"i don't remember this movie, so i know it was bad. i probably did not watch the whole thing. bad production, bad acting"
1,Save your money,"If you want a game for the whole family to enjoy, get Shrek.Just because the cartoons may be good, doesn't mean the game is.My 6 year-old doesn't like it."
1,One Strike,The product deflated during the night. We refilled and let sit with no one in it for a while and it still lost air. I was very disappointed as the product initially started great for my Aunt who would not have been able to be on the floor with a traditional air mattress. I am attempting an exchange hoping it was just this one item. Most of the reviews were glowing and I am hoping that the replacement will perform as the other reviews indicated.
2,Mostly quite good.,"The book has many very good points and suggestions for educators to deal with difficult parents. I bought two copies as gifts for colleagues who just started their careers as elementary school principals, and they liked it as well. As with most books regarding education topics, there are some things that are utopian, such as encouraging parents to contact you at home making relations so much better."
2,Unbelievable game!,This is the most mindboggling game that we have ever played. We finally got to the point that we thought Radica could actually hear what object we were thinking of so started to write it down. I bought some to give to both adults and kids age 10 thru 22. Would recommend this to anyone.
1,Save your time and money,"Kettlebell Bombshell with Lisa BalashI too was very disappointed with this DVD. I own quite a few workout DVDs as I like to exercise in the privacy of my own home. I've really gotten into kettle bells so I was excited when I read the reviews. It seems to give good instruction, but that's about it. The workouts aren't much of a workout. There are three minute rests between moves. I could drive to McDonald's and eat a cheeseburger before she starts on the next one. I guess you could hold the remote and keep fast-forwarding, but I have better things to do. This is the only workout DVD I've ever requested a refund for. The long, positive reviews must be from friends and business associates."
2,thought provoking,"I read this book for the second time, this time with my bookclub and I have to up my rating, one whole star. Talking about this book in a group with women who have experienced the same feelings as Venus and Kandi was an enlightening experience. I can see where the author was going with the faulty ending. I can respect her choice for giving Clint to the other woman. Sometimes life happens that way and isn't truth stranger than fiction."
2,Required Reading,"I regard Dr. Bernstein as the top authority for Diabetes. This book will give a diabetic all the information required to completely understand his/her condition. I do not have the discipline to follow his recommended diet...however, with the understanding of Carbs, I can with diligence control blood sugars. I give more credence to the Glycemic Index than Dr. Bernstein...seems to work for me. I do not hesitate to recommend this book to all diabetics and partners of diabetics!"
1,Helter Skelter: The DA's own fabrication,"This story is not the true story of the murders, but the concoction of VB. The whole Helter Skelter theory was in his mind and in his mind only-he saw ahead to the book deal and movie. Of all the seat's in the court room, over 98% were taken by media. He played into their hands by making up this totally outrageous story (prompted by a liar Sadie and turn coat,get me outta my legal mess Danny DeCarlo). This is fiction. And by the way, Charlie wasn't even present at any of the murder scenes, nor did he order any murders, so why is he in prison? Because he received an unfair trial at the hands of VB. This book is NOT recommended."
2,For the hard to reach area of your back.,"Just happened upon this spray several years ago, but was never able to find it in the store again. After my 80ish year old mother used it, it is a regular item on her shopping list. I order it on the internet for her and get several bottles while I am at it to save on the shipping."
1,A Majority of One DVD-R movie,"If this was a professional DVD, it would not be made on a DVD-R disk. Instead it should be made on a dual layer DVD disk because it is over two hours. This DVD-R disk must therefore be less quality than standard play playback. Not good for High Definition flat screens, especially the larger size screens. By the way, this movie was broadcasted by Turner Classic Movies in letterboxed form. The TCM broadcast movie differed from the movie I had on prerecorded VHS tape. The TCM movie plot was better than what was on the VHS version. Also the TCM version was in widescreen and more sharp than the VHS version. The source of where this DVD version came from which you are selling is NOT provided and that is one more reason why I won't buy it. Sincerely, Rick Gershon.A Majority of One"
2,Don't be too critical,"Don't be too critical of this flick. I've recently discovered Randal Malone to be quite entertaining, if not over the top at times, and consistent with making the rounds in B Horror; and he was creepy in this one. Yes, dimbulb college morons get killed off in this (like about five thousand other slasher flicks) and some can act and some are just eye candy like in Hell Night, Halloween, Friday the 13th and a Nightmare on Elm Street. This one leans more toward Prom Night (1980) or Deadly Lessons, though, with its level of gore and characterizations. It IS shot on video (a high def camera, I believe, if the crisp image is any indication) but as any horrorhound knows this isn't necessarily a bad thing (The Ripper from 1985 remains the low bar here). There is no new ground here (sorry Saw fans) and victims die because they're stupid. This is a fair little film and I keep hearing Randal Malone ask, ""Why are you here?"" in that distant, myopic voice that reminds me of Vinent Price."
2,works well,"does as advertised. Bought this because of current reviews and it's great. I have to ""repair"" the connection about once every 2 weeks on the machine being used with this card, but I never have to repair the connection on my other computer. Not sure why this is, but it's a really fast fix and never causes problems."
2,Great simple game,I purchased this game for the holidays for my daughter who just turned four. The game is fast enough that it keeps her attention. She is able to follow along with the instructions of the game. It allows her to work on counting and following instructions.
2,Emmy-winning pseudo-documentary about US nuclear terrorists,"This is a fairly unique and highly-praised TV movie designed, like Orson Welles' radio broadcast of WAR OF THE WORLDS, as if it were real coverage of a nuclear terrorist event on the East Coast of the U.S. More realistic than its contemporary, THE DAY AFTER, this film scared the network enough that they kept running disclaimers throughout its presentation stating that it was not an actual news event. If that description and the subsequent Emmies aren't enough to whet your appetite, I'd say this is just that much more scary in the post-9/11 era. Not a well known TV movie, but it seems even less like fiction now with its urban nuclear terrorist threat and non-stop news coverage of the events. Worth seeing."
2,AMAZON.COM IS BEING UTTERLY IRRESPONSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't understand how Amazon.com can allow ""reviews"" with vulgarities and obvious intentions to slam the artist rather than reviewing the cd, to be posted. Is this how Amazon.com wants to be portrayed? Trashy because it allows trashy ""reviews"" to be posted. This is outright irresponsibility especially when children may visit this site!Why does Amazon.com even bother to state ""Please be sure to focus your comments on the album's content. Read our review guidelines for more information"" when it isn't responsible enough to check before it allows posts of this dispicable nature to be put up. I am deeply disappointed!Having said all that Clay's Measure of a Man is an excellent cd and no intentional slams of Clay or his cd will make fans of Clay to change their minds. In fact, I know of many people who are not even fans of Clay and they love this cd. A great cd is a great cd, period."
2,Just the perfect thing.,"I only use these during the winter, but they are so wonderful for warm winter drinks. Hot chocolate with whipped cream, hot apple cider with a cinnamon stick, hot buttered rum, mulled wine, homemade egg nog. Mmmmm.When I received these I promptly dropped one on the tile from about five feet. It damaged my foot on the bounce more than it was damaged. Actually, it was completely fine - not a single chip. Big, thick, durable - everything they should be."
2,Courageous and Inspiring,"This year marks the 100th anniversary of the publication of ""Up From Slavery."" I hope that in celebration of this anniversary, many people will discover Washington's autobiography for the first time. I was fascinated and inspired by Washington's quiet and humble manner as he describes what it was like to be a slave as a youth. Washington traces his struggle for an education, and his later challenges and trials as an educator. His account of the building and molding of the Tuskeegee Institute is one of the most inspiring stories I have read in years. Washington did not want to have anything handed to him. He wanted to earn every goal he set for himself, and earn them he did. His influence was and continues to be incredible. This is an amazing book every American should read."
2,Can be a migraine trigger,"Very talky, lots of fun, and a tour de force for both Olivier and Caine. In fact it's overload for some viewers, i.e. if your idea of a great film isn't a dialog between just two characters for 2+ hours, you'll likely hate this movie. Personally, while watching ""Sleuth"", I kept expecting Jon Lovitz to pop out of a closet and yell, ""ACTING!""If a few of the props in ""Sleuth"" look strangely familiar, they're from original ""Twilight Zone"" episodes."
1,Just terrible,"This book is contrived, poorly written, and far-fetched. It casts Church conservatives as evil and diabolical men trying to thwart the will of God by hiding and/or destroying the revelations from Fatima and Medjugorie. It turns out that the 'revelations' are based on God's dissatisfaction with Church doctrine in areas that liberals are always whiny about.**Spoiler below**So the repeated appearances of the Virgin Mary were due to her anger that the Church opposed homosexual marriage, abortion, female priests, and allowing priests to marry and have families. How lame and predictable. Terrible book and a waste of time."

1,AAAARRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!,"Minus ""Tubthumping"", listening to this album is equal to putting your head in the frig. and slamming the door! Avoid the hype. Not even good dance music."
2,Great Read,"Anyone who thinks that becoming addicted to Valium can't happen to them should read this book. Brutally honest it follows Barbara Gordon, a successful award winning documentary film maker, through her addiction to Valium and her painful struggle to get off. This is a great read. I won this from Goodreads."
1,"Artistically censored, DO NOT SUPPORT THIS EDITION!","While walking through Barnes and Noble after Christmas, I was wondering how to spend my gift card. By chance, I decided to travel down memory lane and pick up the boxed set of my favorite scary story collections as a child. Horrified (in a bad way), I looked at the shell of the books I once loved as an elementary school child. The original pictures made this collection so unique! For whatever spineless reason, the publisher decided to replace the original ghastly pictures with tame and watered-down versions. Sure, the stories are the same...but the artwork just doesn't fit. It is blasphemy to mess with such perfection. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS VERSION BY PURCHASING IT! Instead, hunt down the originals and buy them. You will be glad you did!"
2,Monochrome Black Low Top Converse Chuck Taylor Sneakers,Very happy with these sneakers. Look great and feel comfortable. Want to buy another pair!!
1,I DON'T UNDERSTAND...,I AM A FRESHMEN AND I WAS REQUIRED TO READ THIS BOOK.I AM ON PAGE 29. I DON'T GET A WORD I HAVE READ. I FEEL LIKE I'M READING IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. MABY IT'S BECAUSE I'M YOUNG.OR BECAUSE I'M ONLY ON PAGE 29.ALL I KNOW IS THAT I'M LOST.I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO REVIEWED THIS BOOK. YOU HAVE HELPED ALOT.
1,too old,Written in 1970's it's really too old to apply to todays lifestyles and trends on fry cookery but it does have some classics. Glad I bought it used-but shipping was more than the price!
2,Could Really Happen,"A lot of people have compared this to Hostel, but this is a much better movie than Hostel. First of all, this movie has more of a plausible plot. Young people on vacation in Brazil are lured away from their hotel to become unwilling organ donors. Josh Dumal, Fergie's hubby and former Vegas star, is one of the actors. I think organ stealing is possible and maybe even probable when certain groups of people (can you say drug cartels?) have unlimited money. I have definitely seen some weird situations in Brazil and in other places in South America. Thank God that none of the things I have seen compare to this movie. Very scary. The acting is good, the tension and thriller elements are good and even the scenery is good. It is very gory though, so if you cannot stand the blood, get out of the jungle operating room."
1,Very disappointing,"I ordered this new knife from Amazon based on the Laguiole name, prior Sabatier experience and the one review (5 stars). What a disappointment! One side of the blade had very visible tarnish and reddish blue spots (not sure whether rust or previously used). It also has a very light and extremely cheap look with poor manufacture. It is made in France, but it goes to show that junk comes out from there just as easy as from China, Pakistan or anywhere else. True you get what you pay for, but this one wouldn't be worth even 2 bucks at a yard sale. Maybe it was a defective unit, but I didn't want to take a chance with a replacement. I never even tried to use it, and simply returned it. To Amazon's credit, their return process was great. Just follow the online ""return"" process, print the (free/prepaid) return label, and take it to any USPS station. Amazon's service earned the second extra star."
1,broken,When the tool set arrived it was okay..smaller than I thought but mostly one of the tools was broken so it made the set not acceptable.
1,moonstruck,This is one of the best movies of all time. The only reason I dont have this movie on DVD is because it is only available in full screen. The movie is a 5 star movie but the DVD only receives 2 stars because of the lack of options for widescreen viewing. I am waiting patiently for them to change it to widescreen and until then unfortunately I suggest the same. You miss so much including the director's vision when you watch it in full screen that it is not worth it until you can see this fabulous movie as the way it was originally made.
1,Won't order these again.,We prefer the Swaddlers! Much more roomy - big difference between these and the Swaddlers. We won't order these again!
1,Why does everyone like this book?,"I have always liked Julie Garwood (until the Roses). But this book is pretty lame. It has echoes of her past style, but is vastly inferior. The first few chapters were so confusing that I checked to see if pages were missing from my book. I tried hard to like it, but how many times can you read: Brodick; Yes Judith; Gillian; Yes Brodick; Ian; Yes Ramsey; Did Ms Garwood need some filler? No one talks that way. I was quite disappointed, but read it anyway."
1,Junk,"Wanting to share my water rocket memories with my kids, I decided to try this rocket out in spite of all the bad reviews. I agree, it is junk. While the whole thing is cheaply constructed, the biggest problem I see is with the pump. The valving is so defective it simply will not pressurize the rocket. Even though I was very gentle with the pump, it came apart after only a couple pumps and the rocket never flew. I'd love to find a good one of these but this one is not."
2,Outstanding performance,"I got to see this talented duo perform live twice last year, and was thrilled when they released their first recording. I love their program - quite varied and different from what any other duos out there are playing. The performance is pristine, and the recording quality is great, with nice stereo separation between them (I believe Risa in on the left channel?). My only gripe is that the recording level is a bit low, so you've got to crank the volume quite a bit (still sounds great though, especially w/ headphones). The Prelude, Fugue and Variation by Franck alone to me is worth the price of the disc, I can't get enough of that haunting theme. This is my favorite CD purchase of the past 6 months."
1,TOO SMALL,"I was so disappointed, much too small, not as described. I did not believe this was to be a large."
1,Disappointing and Drab,"I'm a big American Idol fan so I bought this CD. But if you are not an obsessed die hard of Clay Aiken...you will be disappointed. I think he should accentuate the twang some more and go after a country audience. This CD was nothing but schmaltzy, drab, and mediocre. So don't listen to all the raves without realizing that Clay's nutty fans think he's the second coming."
1,Pile of Junk - Save your money!,"The first one I received the SD card slot lock did not work. The second one literally took 5 to 10 minutes to boot up. I returned it again to Discount Jungle (Amazon Seller) and they said they would not charge me the 15% restocking fee which they did anyhow.All in all, I wouldn't own another Sandisk MP3 even if they would give me one for free! I'm out $10.00 for two return shipments and another $10.00 restocking fee. Nothing to restock at Discount Jungle, send the piece of junk back to Sandisk!!!Save some headaches and buy something different! Do a Google search for Sansa View slow start up, boot, or lockup.At least the FM Radio was nice....that's why it has a two star rating. I'd sure hate to see how well the re-manufactured units work."
1,Watch the original instead,"Being a fan of the haunted house genre, when I first saw the teaser trailer in the theater, I was extremely excited. That excitement didn't last long. This movie was a ridiculous remake of one of the classic haunted house films, and I'd never recommend this. Special effects are not scarry. What you don't see but know is there is what will make people remember the story and come back time and time again. Rent or buy the original instead, it's much creepier."
2,most intense book i've ever read !!!,I read Disturb not the dream maybe fifteen years ago. When I saw Amazon book search it was the first thing that came to mind. Definetly the best scary book ever once you start you just cant stop
1,unuseful for this day and age...,I love frugal and economical but this book made no sense to me. Reminds me of the foxwoods books but not nearly as useful.My first Kindle book that I had to delete without even reading half.
2,America's Shame,"As a Veteran, I am apalled and sickened by the contents of this book. If even a small percentage of the allegations outlined in this book are true; this has to be America's greatest shame. Abandoning those who fought and served in harm's way for their country is inexcusable.The first half of the book seems to be all about explaining the abandoning of our POWs, which has taken place since WWI, and establishing the credentials of the Communist official who provided most of the ""facts."" It requires a lot of concentration to wade through all the facts and dates. The second half deals with the ""nuts and bolts"" of the abandonments and methods of attempts to cover it all up. The government agencies involved includes almost every DOD and Security agency in our frderal government along with most members of congress and the executive branch. Fascinating but disgusting.Man up and bring our Heroes home."
2,Classic,Chucks rock! Got these to match with my 2 and 4 year old boys. They love when we all put our chucks on together. These never go out of style.
1,Way Too Small!,"Do not ignore the previous posters complaints about the size of these weights. I did! I'm a woman with a wrist 6.75 inches in diameter and I wear a size 7 or medium glove. These weights are extremely hard to get on and very uncomfortable to wear. I really think they are only suitable for a child or a very, very small woman.Also the weights I received do not look like the pictured item. Valeo seems to have changed the entire design of these. Maybe they were better before? The pictured item seems to have a larger diameter in the opening. The ones I got desperately need some elastic or something."
2,Science Fiction Masterpiece,"Besides his Robot stories and novels, Foundation stands as oneof the greatest science fiction novel written by the late IsaacAsimov.By mixing properly the future, humanity and the sociopoliticaldevelopment of our race on a galactic span using the decline ofthe Roman Empire as a base, Asimov tells us a story of one man'sstruggle and the product of its stubborness in following stories.This book is a must for anyone, genre fan or not, I guaranteeyou will read it more than once in your lifetime."
1,sad state of affairs,"Checked this sad excuse for a book out at the library -- glad I didn't pay for it. Stay at home moms unite in our insecurities -- that is these authors' message loud and clear. (Hello, Dr. Laura is known for this muck, yet where is her family?) Ever notice the lack of books written by working moms who criticize stay at home moms? They're generally too busy applying themselves to better pursuits.I'm a part-time working mom who is proud to set an example for my daughter. She won't be anyone's handmaiden in life. We should all have higher hopes for our daughters. They can and should do BOTH."
1,Useless that text to speech is not enabled!,"Hi!I guess I didn't look too carefully and missed that text to speech was not enabled.Is there a way to get the publisher to change their mind?Thanks,per"
1,CRAP,I don't know what happened to Natalise between her first album and this one. She was so sweet on the first one and the music was good. Now she comes off like a wannabe tough girl swearing all over this record. There really did not need to be all of that. The music wasn't even hot. I'm sorry that I paid good money for this album. Buyer beware!!!
1,Couldn't Watch,I have been looking for this movie for a long while. It came and I put it in to watch it; it stopped playing 3/4 of the way through!!! I tried it in all of our devices and it did the same thing each time! Very disappointed!!!
1,Sony makes great TVs not VCRs,"I have been shopping for a new VCR since both of my much older ones died (within a month of each other!). My Toshiba and my RCA, both made it to about 8 or 9 years old. In doing the shopping math - my old VCR repairman kept admonishing me to stay away from the Sony - good TVs and other electronics, but VCRs are not their forte, he said. In doing so, I found he was right, as also evidenced by the other reviews from guests. My VCR repairman would know, he repairs what can't be returned! So, now I'm looking at Panasonic and RCA. Thanks to all of you who tried to warn me - I'll get over my system not being totally Sony. I had to learn the hard way though.... still, why can't Sony make a VCR that works quietly?"
2,I like it.,"I haven't read Shirley Jackson's novel, but I've seen the old movie and this one. Compared to the 1963-movie, this one is quite different, at least the story. But I like it. I like the characters, they're quite similar to those in the original movie. The insecure, nervous Nell (Lili Taylor), self confident Luke (Owen Wilson) and Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The actors are good (I forgot to mention Liam Neeson as Dr Marrow), also the supporting actors, for example Marian Seldes as the creepy Mrs. Dudley.The special effects are impressing and the music is also very good. One thing that feels unnecessary is that the filmmakers seem to have tried to give the movie a creepy, 'haunting', feeling too early, even in the end of the first scene, in Nell's bedroom.I like this movie and I think it's quite underrated. It has a number of good scenes. The scene with the photo album with the pictures of Hugh and Carolyn Crain is a favorite... It's nice to see a good new haunted house movie."
1,crosby stlls and nash live in LA 2007,DVD is not a 2007 concert but one in the 1980's.Title is misleading. Sound is also out of sync on some songs. Dissapointng.Live in L.a.
1,Kiddie Fodder...,"Crap, crap, crap. Bad acting, big explosions, and video game CGI a good movie does not make. Like a 2 hour Hasbro toy commercial. This film made Star Wars Episode 1 with Jar Jar Binks seem like an Academy Award worthy film. And I'm a Superhero/Godzilla/Monster geek...this is just awful...terrible. At least the first one was semi-watchable--and where's Megan Fox? That would have been the only redeeming quality in this junk-fest...I mean alien robots who change into cars and trucks??? It's a movie based on a TOY for God's sake! A bad toy made into an even worse film. Avoid like The Plague."
2,Chilling tale of anti-utopian England,"I won't say that Orwell was ahead of his time, because 1984 came and went without any domineering governments popping up, but this is still a brilliant book. It follows the life of Winston Smith, who edits history to serve ""the Party"" and its needs. THe Party controls every aspect in peoples' lives, watching and listening as much as possible. Nonetheless, Winston begins a love affair with a co-worker, knowing only too well the ramifications of doing so. 1984 also provides some interesting insights about how weak memory when compared to facts, or what everybosy says are facts. A true classic of 20th Century Literature."
2,Great product!,"Hey GuysThanks for the product, arrived swiftly and is in great working order really happy! What an awesome movie go SA!!!"
1,Bad cutting and way too big,"It's definitely not having the cutting as shown on the model. I ordered size M as that's suggested on the the manufacturer's site for size 6. It's way too big. I exchanged it for size S. I have 36"" breast and 26"" waist and it's still way too big.The cutting is very bad as well. It's just a giant piece of flat cloth and they didn't have the shape for cups. Thus once you tie up at the back, you will have a weird surplus of fabric underneath your boobs. Very ill fitting."
2,get the same 2 movies plus 2 more,this is being re issued as a 4 movie set mgm has released the double feature discs in a new package that has these movies bundled with another double feature set in one case. still midnight movies but a 4 movie set all the double features are being combined better deal.
1,Vanessa is...,"One of the WORST vocalists out there today. I can't think of a more irritating ""singer"" than Ms. Carlton. Thankfully her latest CD bombed so hopefully I won't have to be subjected to her pre-school-like vocals."
1,Unreliable,"Since I have ordered for this product and inspite of the company debiting the total amount for the product from my account, I have not recieved the product till date. The company promises to deliver the product in 12 hrs but its approx more than 3 weeks since the amount was debited but till now, the product hasnt reached me. The company doesnt respond to email queries and its toll free number (the only other point of contact mentioned from their end other than email address) always sounds busy and goes to voicemail."
1,Redundant and repetitious.,"""Tom...don't quit your day job.""The Greatest Generation is both cliche-ridden and self-servng.This book is merely a platform for Mr. Brokaw's ultra-left leanings.Tom never tells us what some of these heroes think of our present ""commander in chief."""
2,Great item. A must buy.,Wonderful product that was easy to install.. Item arrived quickly. Necessary if you have the apprpropriate TIVO and not wanting phone line cords everywhere.
2,Very good and very unlike the movie,"I am an avid reader, specially of books in the English language. The movie ""The Scarlet Letter"" has been a favorite of mine, but reading other reviews of the novel (other editions) here in Amazon, prompted me to read it. People kept saying they were dissapointed with the movie and vice versa; people kept saying they could not deal with Hawthorne's 19th century language. But I could deal perfectly with the idiom, even though it's not my first language. Both the movie and the novel are excellent, although different."
1,Book was not trimmed,The first copy of the book I received was not trimmed along the long side making it very difficult to turn the pages. I returned the book and received another one the next day (BTW Amazon's replacement policy is great and their customer service is awesome as well). The second copy of the book I received was also not trimmed along the long side. I was refunded for the book and purchased it elsewhere.
1,1962 version bothered me,"I have several fetal development books now, but this one is the only one I couldn't stand to keep. I tore out a few of the best pictures and threw the rest of the book away. I had the 1962 version, so I can't speak for any other editions. It explains in the book that the picture sequences documenting the development of movement were of babies born very early, as early as the 6th week. I don't believe they were aborted on purpose or anything, but I couldn't stand to see how they were being touched with a hair to see how they move... that seems cruel to me. That sort of thing is not what I want to see when I'm expecting! The authors other book, Beginning Life is much, much better. It has better pictures and is more sensitive to the well-being of the pictured fetuses."
2,Unheard talent,"Being a huge fan of Green Carnation and Agalloch, I decided to pick up this album and their ""Heart Of The Ages"" album at the same time. Honestly, this album seems like exactly what you would get when you cross those two bands. Impressed? Yes, overall this album was pretty awesome. The dark atmosphere was perfectly created. The female vocals in my opinion were better than the male vocals. A five star review is out of the question because the male vocals in fact were not very impressive at all. At times, I was so impressed with the background elements that I just wished the male vocals would just stop. Overall though, this album was a great purchase and is a must have for any fans of Agalloch, Green Carnation, or Katatonia."
2,Outdated - Does not match new test specificiations (April 2011),"Please note that the format of the Chemical PE exam will change somewhat starting in April 2011. This sample exam is based on the old format that was used until October 2010. The problems are still helpful when practicing for the exam, but this book has no longer the same ""look and feel"" as the new exam. NCEES has a new sample exam book out that matches the new exam specifications and can be ordered from the NCEES website."
1,Not worth the $2.99,"I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds. I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one. Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs! If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking."
1,profanity the movie!!! or profanity and the degenerates.!!!,"i cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate , trailer trash movie like this,but i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them. this movie is as funny as a sewer, all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanity,virtually ever second word. the writer who has very little ,if not any intelligents, has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writing.is the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly?. yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity. however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing. if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you."
2,Run Lola Run,"This film is amazing... not only is the cinematography masterfully done, but also the many layers of the entire film. I especially love it on DVD because I can hear the director and Franka's opinions about the film. Also, wide screen... need I say more?"
2,I love SOKEN Ramen,"I think the Spicy Dragon is very good, although not that spicy, if you want something a little more spicy try the Wasabi with green tea noodles. This has been the only msg free and vegetarian ramen that I have been able to purchase in my local stores and now none of them carry it any longer. Thank god for the internet."
1,Huggies are better . . .,"I, like many other reviewers, fell into the trap of buying these because they were going for a great price. My son had been wearing Huggies size 3, but I thought these might be worth a try. My husband and I now have a joke that our son has been crawling in the cobwebs again. These diapers fall apart and the fibers look like little spiderwebs hanging off his little bum. Sometimes we find our son plucking the ""webs"" off his diaper like someone plucking a chicken. I would not recommend these diapers, especially for active babies."
2,Good Book,A historical romance from the 1700's that tells of the true massacre of the French by the Natchez Indians. A good read.
2,"An eye-opening, mind expanding series of accounts","Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences: Angles, Aliens, Dolphins & Shamans by Timothy Wyllie is an original collection of amazing metaphysical adventure stories, exploring telepathic experiences with angels, dolphins, and humans around the globe; planetary mysteries; and the essence of extraterrestrial intelligence. Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences is highly recommended reading for students of metaphysics and spirituality as an eye-opening, mind expanding series of accounts revealing mysteries as yet unplumbed by modern science."
2,emotional impact,"This novel intricately portrayed what Guy was experiencing, if you read this book in one sitting and allow yourself to absorb what is happening, you can feel the choas and indecision that ravages Montag's pyche. This was a refreshing aspect after reading so many award winning books that seem to try too hard to force emotional impact upon the reader."
1,Technical book written by someone who does not know how to write a technical book.,"It is too bad that this is practically the only one of the kind. The aim is great, the contents are great, but the author does not know how to write a technical book. The author refers to concepts and terms that are yet to be defined or never defined at all. For example, at the very beginning, the author talks about ""violet"" and ""purple"". Am I the only one who did not know ""violet"" means a color of a single frequency, whereas ""purple"" is a color of combined frequencies? This is a No-No for mathematicians and scientists. For those of who are already familiar with Color Theory, the book must be a great assurance, articulation or enhancement of their existing knowledge, but for those who are new and try to learn as an artist, this is a nightmare. I am the latter kind. The only reason I could finish it was because I am familiar with fundamental physics and optics already."
2,Good value,I love Curve and this is a large bottle which make is a very good value. Highly recommended.
2,"At last, a construction safety text that addresses hazards","Learn how to ask the right questions with this excellent book. Dave not only provides a simple approach to a complex subject, he focuses on the critical hazard recognition necessary to eliminate (by design) or control those hazards. His monthly Hazard Information Newsletter keeps the reader up-to-date with each hazard and its control, on a detailed basis as an extension of this book."
1,Um...NO.,"Ok I hate to burst anyone's bubble about this movie...but it says on the cover ""A better and scarier movie than Hostel"". Um...NO. I actually enjoyed it up to the point where they got into the house and it got dark. From that point on the movie took place in nothing but darkness and you could not tell what was happeneing or who was who. So so annoying. This movie pissed me off. Don't waste your money. Thank god I only paid a few bucks for it. A complete waste of time. Eww."
1,Don't Trust the Images,"Dockers are Dockers, so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. ""Cafe,"" for example, should be ""Coffee."" Despite the fact that the image for ""Cafe"" shows a stone or very light gray color, ""Cafe"" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got."
2,Very inciteful,"I had rather low expectations since this was a free kindle book, but I gave it a try. I found myself captivated and enriched. Hezekiah is one of my favorite characters because he represented a person devoted to God in the midst of a people far from God. This book gave me much greater insight into what he faced and how the nation of Judah was politically, socially, and religiously during that time. It was a great read and I highly recommend it whether you are a student of OT history or not. It was hard at times to keep in mind that this was a novel. The historical setting is vivid and I believe it to be based on solid historical research. Enjoy!"
1,Very Disappointing,"Oh dear, this was such a disappointment. Diana Ackerman spends too much time in pointless shots (looking a river; admiring her own photos from childhood) and has produced a NOVA series that seriously misses the mark. Too little science, too much irrelevant material. While one can certainly connect art and human experience with scientific knowledge about how the brain works, this series didn't do so successfully. If you were hoping to reveal the wonder of the senses for your students, do not buy this series. Unfortunately, I ordered it through an affiliated store with Amazon and they won't answer my queries about whether/how I can return it."
1,Title should have been...,"More like Measure of a Queen. Clay Aiken releases her first full disc with much fanfare and hype, too bad she doesn't deliver. Each song is painstakingly boring and just used as a vehicle for her to try and recapture the Idol glory days. If only this disc really were ""Invisible,"" then we'd all be a lot happier. The only thing more excrutiatingly bad than this is the fear that soon we will have Reuben Chubs dropping his CD. Please Idols disappear!"
2,Toxicity ROX !,"Well I presumed nothing would top System's self depute album...I was wongs. 'Toxicity' is THE BEST heavy/rock album I have ever listened. Tracks such as ATWA and X touch an more of a sensitive side of the band, but dont worry, they keep their natural stile of playing in every track. Other tracks such as 'Arto' remind us where the band had originated from, Armenia with the insturment used 'doodook' (also originated from Armenia). This is very commendable for a foreign band to I'd recomend this album to anyone that appreciates good music."
2,An Excellent Movie,"It's intelligent, insightful, and very funny. Brilliant performances by Julie Walters and Michael Caine in a story that you wish was true. I see very little that can be improved here, and it's one of those very rare films that I'll put back on my little shelf to watch again later."
1,Too Old,"I bought the lipstick as mine had turned old and I wanted a fresh one (even though the color has been discontinued). The lipstick I received was the same quality of old as the one I already own. The lipsticks are old and should be thrown out! For $17, the vendor should not be selling."
2,"SOON,SOON,SOON,.................","Names Marcus from Sydney,Australia.I saw Queensryche when they came 'down under'and toured in July.They were totally AWESOME live,ans so I have been following there progress on the QR website.I can now hardly wait until I can get a copy of Queensrche: Mindcrime at the Moore.I met the guys after and they were fantastic to meet,along with Pamela Moore who reprised her roll as Sister Mary.A fantastic voice in Mind crime as well as a solo artist.I hope that one day they can come back 'DOWN' with this great act.This has to be a must for any 'QR' fan........................"
2,Mr & Mrs Who?,"I am well into the book and am enjoying it as I am a fan of Belva Plain. However, no where so far do I find the last name of Hyacinth's family or Gerald's family. They are Dr & Mrs Gerald Who? Am I missing something or was this intentional on the part of the author?"
1,Piece of Junk,"First I am disappointed that Amazon makes you give at least one star. My advise on this sorry excuse for a printer is to save your money...save yourself from more gray hairs...save your kids from having to hear you yell obscenities...and don't buy this piece of junk! Unless you enjoy having to load each sheet of paper one at a time every time you print, all the time in hopes that it will take the paper and not jam. If that sounds like fun - then my friend...this is the printer for you! Me on the other hand, I will never own another HP."
2,Does the job and the kids like it.,"Shoes were creating a mess on our garage floor so I purchased this unit. It works great, it is very sturdy/heavy. It was super easy to assemble (took less than 5 minutes) Fully assembled, it is pretty sturdy. It does wobble a tiny bit, but that may be because our floor is not even in the garage. The great thing is that it keeps the shoes off the floor and the kids like using it so they are more likely to put their own shoes away."
2,Buy Things From These People,I ordered a rare CD that I had a lot of trouble finding in other places. It was cheap and got to me over two weeks earlier than Amazon estimated. This vendor will be at the top of my list when I purchase my next CD.
2,the best cookery book I own!,"This is the book to buy for all your vegan and vegetarian friends and family members. It is easy to read and to use... has great recipes and handy hints in a novel layout - and the best part of all is that everything tastes delicious! Some vegan recipes might be healthy but they are not always as tasty as the 'original' Not so with this book! Bryanna's book is filled with recipes ranging from basic cooking instructions to exotic desserts... all yummy and all relatively easy to make.As an added bonus, Bryanna gives lists of mail order resources for sometimes hard to find items - this is especially valuable if you are like me and live in a rural area without easy access to health stores.If you buy just one recipe book this Christmas season, this is the one to get! If I could give it six stars I would!"
2,FAHRENHEIT 451,"Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-written book by Ray Bradbury. Sometimes this book did get very weird, but it all had a purpose towards the end of the book. The author of this book had a very good idea for a story like this and he wrote it very well.Guy Montag has had his job for ten years as a fireman, but books were for burning and the houses in which they were hidden. This man goes out on midnight, runs and watches pages become inflamed in fire. Then he meets a professor that tells him in the future when people could think, and then he realizes what he has to do.I enjoyed this book quite a bit and I would recommend this book for you if you like Science Fiction."
1,That was not what I expected,"I was really excited about the product after I read some reviews. When I got the product I used the first night and went to bed, next morning I had the most surprising results from this product, smooth skin like a velvet free of any lumps, however, the followed days my skin just came back the same rough skin as usual. I am still using the product even I know my skin is the same. No more velvet skin or nothing. I do have Keratosis, I bought this product believing in the reviews that I got from people with the same skin condition than mine. I used on my face also to try to take off some dark spot from sun, it didn't work yet.So I don't like this product because did not do anything for me. I feel I thrown money away."
1,Worthless,"How this man has managed to write so many books while knowing nothing about 1) travel and 2) archaeology is a mystery to me. First he shows up in Jordan with no local money on a Friday (you'd think someone passing themselves off as a knowledgeable traveller would have figured out banks in an Arab country are closed on the Muslim sabbath) Then he continues on with a series of quack theories about aliens, and technologically advanced ancient civilizations, and harps that make rocks float. There not even good quack theories, like Hancock or Buval (who, while equally worthless, at least make an attempt to back up their theories) Read something else."
1,Not HAPPY,I purchased this for my sony camcorder. I have windows XP on my laptop and this cable does not work. My laptop does not even detect my camcorder when attached.............Its a waste according to me
2,Must buy,"I purchased this shirt as a gift for my Dad. It was exactly what he was looking for. It is lightweight, rich-colored, good quality stitching, breathable fabric; perfect gear for a runner. This is a great gift or purchase for yourself; a definite must buy."
1,A great disservice.,"While Shaw may have been a gifted playwright, his ""Saint Joan"" did an enormous disservice to the subject: the view it presents of Joan of Arc conflicts with the historical evidence on nearly every point, echoing instead the propaganda of her enemies. In truth, her trial was orchestrated by the English and their clerical allies (and even Shaw admits that the Inquisition overturned the verdict in 1456, shortly after the English were finally driven out of Rouen); nor was Joan a ""rebel"" except in the minds of her political opponents. By dredging up this fraudulent view of La Pucelle, Shaw's play was among the first popular works to undermine the efforts of countless scholars whose research had brought a more truthful view of the issue to light. For an historically accurate version, I would recommend any book by Regine Pernoud, many of which are offered here at Amazon."
2,nakita's review,"i think this book was a very good book. it is a good book for young teens/adults should read before they go out and do something like partying or drinking underage without thinking first.and hopefully they will think before doing things. over all it was a great book and i would read it again. i recomend this book to young adults, and hope that everyone else who reads it too likes it."
2,My Opinion,"In the book Of Mice and Men by Jonh Steinbeck is about two men that looking for jobs from ranch to ranch.This story takes place in Soledad California,during the Great depresion.The story has two characters: the most important characters are George & Lennie. George is ""small, quick, dark of face and strong hands"" & the other guy is Lennie ""A huge man he has a mind of a child & he likes to touch soft things."" Everything that he knows is because George has thought him. They have dreams, that want to accomplish. Do you think yhat George wants to live & accomplish the dreams with Lennie?I rate this book 4 stars & I really recommend this book to teens because there's only one in a million that knows what friendship is really about. I learned from this book is how to be a better friend."
1,Just ok...,"I have had these for a little over a year now. The edges are starting to chip off, and they have been stained a little. They are ok, but not wonderful. I feel like for a Kitchen Aid product, they should be much better."
2,Gun Digest,The book was bought as a gift for my brother. He likes it and we were very pleased with speed of delivery and service.
1,A Definite Miss,Attention teachers of expository writing:Kingsley can well be used as the quintessential example of an author who disrespects his readers.
2,Feel the Heat of Words,"I must say that this classic, by the master of Science Fiction, is one of the greatest Scifi books written. Ray Bradbury has proved to the literary elitist, that Science Fiction is not just about non-existing technology. No, this novel questions the self-censoring nature of man. It takes place in the future, 1990s, a future for the when the book was written, and tells a tale of a world devoid of books. The firemen, no longer put out fires, but start them. They burn books. Hence the title: the temperature of which paper burns. Though, I suppose the most interesting part of this story is that the policy to burn all books did not come about from the government. No, instead regular people began to democratically burn books themselves because books typically have that one element of life that common people usually do not want to deal with. Controversy."
1,Stick with SimCity or Capitalism 2,"I was thinking ""SimCity helped me learn about real estate and land use in a fun way, so maybe this game might help me learn something."" This game has no educational value. But more importantly, it wasn't even fun.Okay, maybe it was fun for about an hour as I learned my way around the game. But that was mostly anticipation. I then realized that I'd seen all there was to see. Don't waste your time. This game is simplistic and has no depth whatsoever. SimCity is still the best real estate game around, even if it is only in a roundabout sort of way. If you want a good, educational business game, try Capitalism 2. Good tutorials and an actual understanding of how businesses run. If you want a fun business game, there are plenty of other tycoon games that have to be better than this."
1,A disapointed debut album,"I've anticipated this cd for some time and must say it is not what I had expected it to be. I thought it would contain more ballads, lite pop and broadway songs, which he performed on American Idol. This cd is very boring, everything sounds alike. Clay has great range but the music Clive Davis selected for his first cd does not show the versatility shown on American Idol. I still believe Clay is Broadway, not this run of the mill type music."
1,Manufacturer does not honor their warranty,"It was a great mattress topper while it lasted. However, in less than five years of ownership I noticed the topper lost a considerable amount of firmness. It became too soft to sleep on except for the edges and I found myself waking up less refreshed. It's like trying to sleep on a 'V' shaped mattress.I contacted the manufacturer, Foamex, twice via email but they never responded. Finally I called and was told they won't service the mattress; redirecting me back to the seller who has since gone out of business. I have no experience with this seller, however I would suggest anyone considering purchasing a Sensus brand viscoelastic mattress or topper be aware that you will likely have problems before the ten-year warranty has expired. Plus, even if you find a seller who doesn't turn a warranty claim into a hassle, you will find they are rather expensive to repackage and ship. I will not purchase another Sensus or Reflex brand product."
2,The Last Word,"Mesmerizing, Haunting, & Touching are words to describe this movie. The characters, well acted and their stories get under one's skin. A must see."
2,"Nice, could be bigger","Very nice! Great quality. I was surprised, however that I could actually use a bigger one. Even when I make just one latte, my espresso machine does such an awesome job at creating foam - my milk generally foams up and over the pitcher."
2,A great series and great movies,I liked this one better than the first movie about Ori. I think that anyone who liked the series should get it. I haven't seen the extras yet but will as soon as I can.
2,AN EXCEPTIONAL WORK,"This volume is a major contribution to the history of the Luftwaffe during the Russo-Germano war. ""Stopped at Stalingrad"" is also a richly drawn study of the most important air campaigns in the Eastern Front. Written in an accessible style this volume will be welcomed by anyone with an interest in the WWII. I was very pleasantly surprised by the book and also the quality of its contents. The author did a masterful job of research. Joel Hayward draws on diaries of both key commanders and regular airmen. He also shows that the poorly conceived strategies of Hitler and his buffoon, Goering, dommed the efforts of men such von Manstein, Milch and Wolfram von Richthofen (an outstanding soldier) to come to grips with an impossible situation. I heartily recommended this book."
1,king rat,the book is ok but I am very dissapointed in the condition of the book as I am reading it it is falling apart from the binding and it was listed as good condition but in my opion it was in poor condition water stains yellowing pages and binding is falling apart for the price I paid I expected better quality I doubt that I will purchase thru this group ever again Sharyl
1,Disappointed!,"Americans reviewed EXTREMELY worthy--Just that there was no depth--more like a sound byte. And most of the stories came from American soldiers from the Midwest who were fighting in Europe. Hey,there were southerners, and there also was a PACIFIC War. Tom whom I adore and admire can do better than this!!"
2,Wash,This turned out to be a great gift for Christmas time! I'm sure that it would be better to give in the middle of the summer when people are actually washing their vehicles.
2,RUN To The Video Store and Buy This,"This has to be one of the finest foreign action films I have ever seen. Kudos to the Germans on making this a fast paced, edge of your seat fantasy-action, soon to be cult- classic masterpiece. It puts forth intruiging circumstances. What if you didn't miss the bus or what if you bought that lottery ticket? In this film Lola and her boyfriend get to play out three different outcomes to almost identical situations. The dubbing to English is annoying at first but you get used to it. It is slightly off emotion. This is a great addition to your DVD collection."
2,Read this book even if you don't have to,"This is one of the most touching books I have ever read! I won't say why, though, because that would ruin it if you haven't read it. If you have read it, you know exactly what I mean. This book is brilliant. DO NOT read the ending before you've read the rest of the book!!!"
1,"beginners only, maybe","Beginners who would like a quick view into some dance might take advantage of this video. There is an attempt to cover a lot of ground, but none of it is done well. Altea is too angular, stilted and her dancing is not that interesting. I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere for quality dance instruction videos. I will say that this is the first video that I've seen that touches on rhythm and zill work. The variety in costume is interesting, but is not worth the price. I recently acquired several of the Neena and Veena series of dance tapes. These are excellent beginner tapes, they are fun and interesting and they show a great little dance at the end as a reward for your work-out. This series would be a better choice for beginners."
2,beta beta good,"Pardon me, Mr. Owen, but weren't you a character in ""High Fidelity""?""Dry the Rain"" is as representative of the band as any other song, and I often bob my head while listening to it.That notwithstanding, this is an excellent, quirky cd. Some songs are more straightforward, others are weird instrumental fun. Kind of like Cornershop without the South Asian influence."
2,The story of the Bat,"Initiation:This is a movie with some seriously gritty action. It begins with Bruce Wayne as a child and his first up close encounter with bats. A fear for this creature then grips him. After his parents are brutally killed for almost no reason, the transition cycle reaches a next level.The Missing Link:This movie provides the missing link, the element that transforms a scared young boy into a fearless force for justice. This link is located in Asia where he is mentored by Ninja Cult leader Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) and Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). He develops his fighting skills, however, he fails to fully develop the ability to kill.Launching the Batman:Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) finds that upon his return to Gotham City, that it has been overrun by criminals. It is at this point he activates his alter-ego: Batman.Conclusion:Excellent movie, lots of action. Intense and impactful conclusion. Highly recommended."
1,So-so,"Well many people have made this point. This album was rushed. Clay's voice is just fine, but this album takes no chances. in a word it's ""boring"" It is as vanilla as vanilla can be. Clay and his producers need to remember what got him here..Clay is a soft and easy crooner. What do we all remeber Clay for??? The song,""Don't let the sun go down on me."" Face it Clay, you're the next Barry Manilow...and what's wrong with that? Barry is still touring and his records are still selling. So Clay, take some time, find a good composer like Josh Grobin did and sing what you do best, don't sing what teenagers want because you know what my friend...you're past that."
1,"It works, BUT....","My size medium was true to size. This made my waist smaller and while I had it on, I didn't eat as much because of the pressure, it makes me feel full; however, all of the cinchers do this as it is its purpose. I did like the fact that it's shorter from the lower back and a bit longer on the tummy... BUTTT... a HUGE BUT for me... What I didn't like was that it made big bulges of fat on my upper back (eewww!)... and I don't even have back fat!!! So to me this defeats the whole purpose! All it did was cover my stomach fat but GAVE me back fat!!! Also, what's going on with the price increase?? I just bought this 3 weeks ago for $30, now it's $45!"
1,The Worst Book Ever!,"Fahrenheit 451 is the worst book I have ever read in my whole life. I was forced to read it in school, and I disguised the book starting at the first page. There is absolutely nothing good in the book. It makes no sense, and I personally don't think the world will become to be, as predicted in this book. I also find this book very offensive to my religious beliefs. How can a book that takes the name of the Lord in vain, in almost every page, be used as a class novel. Everyone knows that taking the Lord's name in vain is breaking one of God's commandments, and is a sin. I have never read a book that was as bad as Fahrenheit 451 in language. I don't understand how the school boards can justify such a book, and use it for classes. Anyone who hasn't read this book, don't waste your time!"
2,Super Cool,"If you're a Muffs fan, ya gotta love this incredible collection of outtakes, rarities, covers and whatever. Sure, first time Muffs buyers should pick up the first or second album, but this one is great if you're already sold on the band."
1,Gave my son a rash,"I used Pampers exclusively for the first year of my son's life and loved them (Swaddlers, then Cruisers). I stopped using them when they added the Dry-Max, because I heard so many bad things about it. I switched to Up&Up, which I like a lot. I was afraid my baby would have a bad reaction to the Dry-Max. I was under the impression that Baby-Dry didn't have the Dry-max in it. It doesn't say dry-max on the box, anyhow. I got a great deal on a huge box, so I decided to try them. I started using them on Monday, and by Wednesday my son's behind was broke out and inflamed. So now I have 130+ diapers I won't use. Of course, not everyone will have the same problem. But I've tried several brands: Huggies, Luvs, Fisher-Price, generics, etc. and my son never developed a rash. I'm not sure what Pampers is adding to these diapers, but they should have left well enough alone. I will never buy Pampers again."
1,Who knows what this is?,"I bought this thinking it was a band with free jazz reed man, Peter Brotzmann. I was surprised that only two pieces feature him and the rest are Scandinavian polkas. This is the strangest thing. A polka after Brotzmann is enough to jar you for a long time.I returned mine for a refund."
1,A nice way to flood the courts with rightwing fascists,"Not recommended for non-neoconservatives who believe in true justice. The author is just a dog for rightwing politics. The same neonazi neocons who complain about activist judges are themselves promoting their own set in the process. If you believe in losing the Constitution and turning this country into a theocratic dictatorship, then buy this book and join the losers."
2,Love this petit kitchen,"I love this little kitchen. We might have to buy something bigger because we have so many kitchen pots, pans, food and such....but we will still hang onto this kitchen. My 3 kids love it! Also, it can be assembled in minutes!"
2,A GOOD READ FOR YOUNG GIRLS,"THIS IS ONE BOOK THAT I KNEW THAT I SHOULD HAVE READ LONG BEFORE NOW. IT HAS BEEN ON MY MUST-READ LIST FOR A LONG TIME. THIS IS DEFINITELY A BOOK THAT ALL YOUNG WOMEN SHOULD READ. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SET IN THE EARLY 1900'S, SOME THINGS STILL APPLY TO OUR TIMES. IT WAS ALSO INTERESTING TO COMPARE LIFESTYLES THEN AND NOW. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK"
1,"interesting, but...","it's an interesting idea to have a operatic female vox in a metal band; however, her voice is mediocre (you'd know it's true if you know some names from the opera genre), and the music is not original at all. Does anyone know any similar bands (with operatic female vox) that are better than this? Let me know. Thanks!"
1,A dreadful waste of cash,"If this is the ""best of the box"" then thank God I didn't buy the box. Most of this stuff should never have left Cobain's closet."
2,Memories,"Although the quality of the DVD left a bit to be desired, the memories it brought back were fantastic. I had thought those old moments were never to be seen again, but viewing this DVD allowed me to relive them."
2,My son loves it,"Great language, humor and wonderful story telling are hallmarksof Gerald Durrell's books. Always enjoy reading them. I got thisfor my son on his 11th birthday. I think it will also help himgreatly improve his vocabulary."
1,Diaper leaked after 7 hours on the first night,"I bought these because my 6 month old started leaking with her Pamper Swaddlers. These said that they were for overnight protection and would last 12 hours. When I opened the package I was surprised to see that these are thinner than Swaddlers and plastic feeling. I can handle that as long as I don't have to clean urine off of my daughter, her pajamas, and her bed every morning. She sleeps 12 or so hours some nights, but still wakes up for a feeding on most nights. When she woke up after 7 hours for a feeding, her clothes were soaked. Very disappointing. Pick up a small package before you buy the value size to see if they work for you. These diapers did not work for my daughter."
1,Paranoiac...,This record gives one a nightmare. This kind of music needs to stay in the nineties where it belongs.
2,Quick Delivery,Great service and quick delivery.I have ordered this book several times.It is a perfect gift for someone in grief.
2,******It Has It All********,"Thank you Oprah for selecting this book. I absolutely loved it!I owned this novel for a few years before I actually sat down and read it. I often read the first page and felt it was dull - I was wrong. Solitude has become one of the best novels I've ever read. Garcia-Marquez not only includes vivid descriptions but also incorporates everything a novel should have from sibling rivalry, to war, loneliness, magic, humor, drama, incest, sex etc. Solitude is often mysterious and delves into all of our dark thoughts, while also showing our desires. I often found myself frustrated with the decisions the characters made yet understood why they made them.I cannot say enough about this wonderful novel, except I just regret waiting so long to enjoy it."
1,Crocodile Doom,"The product is flaky, fragile and small. My son was dissapointed to see just how small and fragile it was. He played with it once and threw in a corner. And he loves boardgames and creative games. I was dissapointd too. I paid too much for too little."
2,Thought-provoking,"If you have not read this, I strongly recommend it ... ESPECIALLY if you are like me, and somehow ""escaped"" having this assigned to you either in high school or in college, but have always wondered what the hype was all about.Too many times today, you will hear this book discarded as a bunch of prophesies that were way off -- e.g., that in the year 1984 there would be computers and ""telescreens"" that would all but read our minds; that ""Big Brother"" would always be watching us. Many, I'm sure, feel that since this is NOT the case today, that Orwell and his book were / are a wast of time.As for me, the more I read this, the more I see how the overall concept of ""Big Brother"" -- i.e., how information is ""cleansed"" to ""protect"" us; how we are teaching technology itself to out-smart, or at least, stay one step ahead of us -- IS, in fact, all-too-real in our lives today!In any case, very intriguing!"
1,dont waste your time or money.,lower then low budget with horrible dialogue and acting. Two six year olds could have done better with a couple of kindergarten actors
2,Measure of a Man Measures Up,This musical offering was a superb display of Clay's versatility and powerful range. I keep changing my mind on which song is my favourite. I find myself humming bits of each song when I am alone or walking along the beach. My only regret is that it may take some time before a second album is released and I am already anxiously awaiting that event and will definitely pre-order. Measure of a Man is my all-time favourite cd to listen to and I'm 49 years old so I've listened to a few!
2,Welcome to da marketplace!,"This 1985 album by Bunny Wailer is by no means, his best work. That honor goes to ""Blackheart Man"". But ""Marketplace"" does contain some fine pop-reggae tunes such as Stay With The Reggae, Electric City, and Jump Jump. Plus the album cover is great! I recommened picking this up if you can find a copy."
2,Good Value for the Money,"Pretty good value for the money. Prefer Zune's tactile interface. Not much information on how to install Videos, photos or Album Art. But should be able to figure it out from the internet. Try to keep it away from Cell phone, when I put my View in the same pocket as my cell phone it caused the View to lock up or shut down. Like the fact you can add memory with SD cards. Overall more positives than negatives."
1,A BAD ANIME,I can say that this a bad anime.the animation quality is average and the story is dull from start to finish.There isnt any heat or excitement and it doent have a real ending.
1,Reviews are so off--terrible!,"I had high hopes for this product after the Rabbit Habit's beads froze the first time I used it. I thought the way the beads were set in this product would be better and it was, BUT...the material is so stiff that the action of the bunny ears actually HURT my clit! None of the softness and thus realistic tongue like action of the Rabbit Habit. That's really the point, isn't it? It just poked me, along with the hard little nose, which also hurt. Cheap, but a waste of money."
1,Femalien,"This is one of the worst plots, but no worse than many porn plots. The Femalien, who is obviouslyover-sexed, is sent to Earth to observe and participate in human experience -- almost all of it sexual. Contains frontal nudity."
1,This student failed to enjoy it,"A previous reviewer said that as a teacher he's found that students never fail to enjoy William Golding's THE INHERITORS. When this reviewer was a sophomore English student, I can assure him that I failed to enjoy this book. My teacher thought this book was one of the all-time literary greats. I just thought it was boring.And now I have an even bigger reason to dislike this book. I happen to hate reading screeds that trash the author's own ancestors. I'm sure homo sapiens were not perfect, but please show me a race or culture of people who are.My plea to high school English teachers everywhere: If you must require your students to read Golding, have them read LORD OF THE FLIES. It's marginally better than THE INHERITORS and, if I remember correctly, does not include ancestor bashing."
2,A great book.,"Great information, great author. This book is yet another opportunity to realize how much there is to know. I recommend this one."
1,No help!!!,"Difficult to rate. Product came with no help at all as to installation and/or creation of a system that would allow the rental of the movies. Neither TIVO nor Amazon has been helpful in solving my problem and the system, therefore, does not work. Cannot rate very well."
1,This book is good but I wouldn't call it great.,"I liked Rashel and Quinn, they really go together. It was cool how she hunted down vampires and killed them. I loved it when they burned down the house."
2,Can't get too much of a good thing.,"In Crucial Confrontations these 4 author/practitioners continue on the Crucial Conversation path. They begin with definitions of terms, move to concrete examples and provide useful tools for improving dialogue in tough situations, in all aspects of life and work.The ability to have a tool for measuring your abilities in holding crucial confrontations is appealing as we all like to know where we stand.

2,Good diapers,"These diapers were good. They're nice and thin. But compared with luvs with ultra leakguards, I like the price of the luvs better. Performance between the two is about the same for me. These leaked from time-to-time for me but I haven't yet found any that don't."
1,the mark of the maker,The write-up was not good. This is definitely a children's book(?) Very disappointed.
2,I Wonder How FUNKY This Is Gonna Get?!!!!!!!,"I Have Seen The Original Coyote Ugly And Rate It Four And a Half Stars!Wonder How FUNKY This Is Gonna Be?It Is Probably Gonna Have Boobs,Butts,Nakedness,And LOTs More!So Definately Not Reccomended For Ages 1-9!"
1,I was better off with Alexandra Stoddard....,"Very much like Alexandra Stoddard's books, too much alike. Stoddard's books are less wordy and still get to the point. I stopped reading this book when the similarities became clear, been there done that. If you are looking for something in the ""guidance"" area, try Stoddard. She has many better books. I have some and re-read them often for refreshers and finding the ""gems"" I forgot about."
2,Good ones but No indicator,"Only minus point is this product has no indicator.Product is good better than other ones in market, initially i was worried whether this would leak as i read some reviews, i had never faced leakage till now,there is no leakage in this Baby DRY Pammer product, may be i havent tried for more than 12 hours, absoultely good for a 3-4 month old baby."
2,Simply riveting; 1960s and Today: It holds its power,"My sense is that Baldwin wrote The Fire Next Time for anyone who had ears to hear, regardless of color or faith or gender. The emotional intelligence with which he speaks is riveting."
1,Can't get worse,This book is bad (period). It is very incoherent and ill-organized. The examples are vague and serve anything but support the material. Very theoritical with hardly any real life applications. Lacking in modern AI topics/game design.
2,the simpsons christmas 2,"I love this dvd. The reason why I gave it a 4 is because in tis the 15th season, right at the end of act 2 my dvd skips to the end credits. Has any one else seen this problem?"
2,scale,i really like this scale for the money.what i dont like is it weight pointer never stops moving so it can be hard to find an exact weight
2,A Keeper,"This is one of the best musicals of our day. I do have to admit that Gene Kelly's voice by far overpowers all other Tommys that I've heard. However, I believe this guy truly comes in a close 2nd. The voices are truly delightful and make you feel as if you're right there. I do have to admit i'd just buy this cd for this rendision of ""Waiting for my dearie"""
1,disappointing,"I have never seen the American version, but I loved the original British ""Queer as Folk"". It was funny and real. I didn't just believe in these characters, I felt like I knew them. Series 2 is more than a disappointment, it is almost a betrayal. It is not just that the action seems contrived, but so do the characters. I couldn't believe a minute of it. If you were a fan of series 1 you will probably have to see series 2, maybe with lowered expectations you will enjoy it more than I did."
1,I really want to like it,"I really want to like it. It is certainly better than the Huggies I bought before but the quality is no where close to the pamper's cruiser we have been using. It is good if you knew you will change diaper frequently as it will hold just one pee then start to sag. I haven't run into any leaking issue yet as I now use it only when I knew my baby will not stay with it for long. We use it as temporary diaper that is why I still give it a two star rating. It is cheaper for more diapers, you get what you paid for."
2,An Excellent Look Into What Motivates Students Of Ballet.,"This is a very new ballet documentary with many interviews of students and parents on the joys and sacrifices of dancing ballet. There are many fine scenes of dance routines and the technical proficiency of these dancers is very impressive, indeed. Such is the state of ballet in the 21st century! Several aspects are covered, such as training, family support(or the lack of it), competition, injuries, and eating disorders. This is certainly long enough(almost two hours), but my only criticism is that in many of the interviews we see the person seated in a chair for almost the entire segment, instead of having them talk over scenes of dancing. As a ballet dancer myself, when people start to talk about dancing, I want to see dancing while I listen to them(or else I feel the need to get up and dance myself!). There certainly should have been enough of available footage for this. As it is, it is still an excellent, American look at ballet."
1,Defective Plastic,My Bose headphones are extremely lightly used. This is the second time the plastic has broken on the headphones. My husband has had to duck tape them. Bose wants to charge me $100 to replace their defective product.
1,urk...,"Okay, maybe I shouldn't be so mean to a ""classic"", but I found this book quite insufferable. I suppose it's unfair to judge it my modern standards, but I will anyway. I found the policy of our heroes attempting to kill any animal they possibly could more than a little disturbing: when the book mentioned dolphins and sea otters the thought that flashed through my head was ""talking stag"". Not only that, but the book's bloody boring! It consists of many vague, unfocused, and quite unconnected episodes that never evoked any interest whatsoever. I would not have finished this book if I hadn't been reading it for a class. Geesh...Study question: Ned and Conseil: lovers?"
2,I enjoyed myself completely!!!!,"I listen to this cd last night, and I have to say that I think its very good, especially for a first full CD. Mr. Aiken could sing my grocery list and I would be in heaven. Yes, there were a couple of songs which didn't immediately hit me, but with a couple of listens under my belt I enjoyed the heck out of this CD. I say - congratulations MR. AIKEN!!! And remember you can't please all the people all the time, and who would want to? Stay true to yourself, your beliefs and I have no doubt you will go as far as you want to."
2,Easy Purchase....Great Savings!,Thanks to Amazon I no longer have to run to the store to get diapers they just show up on my doorstep! And the savings is great!
1,Save Your Money,"Complete Dreck. the first five minutes were pretty good but it went downhill rapidly after that. It has no redeeming social values: terrible acting, completely phony aerial scenes (reminded me of the first Star Wars battle), and inane dialogue.Wish I could say more but we turned this thing off after an hour of hoping ""it will get better won't it?"" It didn't......"
2,Great Game For Kids!,This is a simple yet active game that keeps children involved and interested. They love to roll the dice and the instrucitons and rules could not be easier. I would recommend this game to anyone with small children!
2,A little something for everyone,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this CD other than a great voice. What I got was that and a great mixture of ballads, mid-tempo songs and songs filled with angst and love. There is something for everyone on this album. Don't listen to reviews that say it is too vanilla or lacks even a hint of sexual innuendo. Listen to the song Touch and hear the sexy longing in the voice and the words. The only thing better than listening to this album would be to see it performed live."
1,"Leaks, leaks, leaks!","This are horrible for newborns. We had one on and not only did it leak through the diaper, but her clothes, blanket, and on to what she was sitting on. So gross. I won't buy these again. This is what I would expect from a cheap knockoff brand not a name brand. Don't make the mistake of buying this for a newborn.They also don't have the indicator strip, so you have to open to see which is frustrating for a newborn. Pay a little more for swaddlers or huggies because they are a waste of money. I'm donating them to a shelter or something because we can't use these."
1,create your own flea circus,"I had used this product at the urging of the pet store clerk. He claimed he had over 20 ferrets and at one time had a flea problem. I vacuumed, sent the dog to the groomers for a flea dip, then came home and sprayed the entire house. I returned after a few hours, opened the widows and started up the air conditioners and picked up the dog. The next day I noticed several adult fleas, though they were sluggish. I thought..great! Then the family started getting bites and seeing small and adult fleas. I feel I wasted my money for a product that seemed to give us 24hrs of relief. Forget the claim that it keeps on acting for up to 7 mos. I am not infested with fleas, but we still have them.....and they are alive and well."
2,Classic literature everybody should read,"This book is great history lesson, written with love and passion.Young people could learn many good things about relationship between woman and man."
1,Heller With a Gun,"to tell you the truth, i didn't like this book. i am not into the whole ""western"" books. i had to read it for a project at my school and i thought it was terrible. plain and simple. sorry to all you out there who liked it but u guys r weird!"
2,"Inspirational, but needs more","I truly enjoyed this movie, but would have liked it to be a little more detailed. It seemed to jump from one scene to another too quickly. The acting was done very well and Sergio Castellitto, protrayed Padre Pio very much like himself. I have already watched it in its entirety about four times. And I still get emotional each time."
1,Worst recording to come along,"in a long time.This has got to be a joke. Please don't wasteyour money on this CD. It's not all what somereviewers on here are saying it is. They areobviously Clay's fans trying to convince the worldthat he has a golden voice. The guy can sing, butbelieve me so can a lot of people. He released thisthing too soon and should have selected better songsto sing. Measure of a man just doesn't do it for me.Sorry Clay, this one flopped."
2,Slightly dated but still good mystery,"Quite a few suspects and a nasty murder--but the victim was really asking for it. You will probably guess whodunnit, but there is still a lot of fun getting there. Good essence of time and place with the characters being well drawn. A little long, but a speedy reader can handle it."
2,One More Comment,"I have already rated and reviewed this album...........the best one of 2003!! But I have one more comment to make to the person that said great singers are only those who write their own music and lyrics. Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Elvis Presley............shall I go on?! They didn't write hardly any of their music. They had people write for them. Why? Because they were the greatest interpators of a song and song writers lined up to have them sing their songs. Clay is the next one in line!! And whose to say he may not write some of his songs in the future?! Some of you people need to understand what music is all about. Just like a book or a movie its all about what we enjoy on an individual basis. If its not your taste in music you don't need to write a scathing review, just say its not your cup of tea and keep your biased opinions to yourself."
1,EXTREMEly obnoxious,"The videography of the trains is outstanding. Unfortunately, the host is about as obnoxious as they come. Screaming, jumping around, arms flailing, and extremely dumb dialog (you can see just about everyone he interviews/works with cringes at the things he says). On top of that, the rapid jump cutting is enough to make you want to hurl. No joke! Most of the scenes shot of Matt's dialog is with the camera right on the ground pointing up towards him while he's shouting at the camera flailing his arms around.This could have been an excellent series, but it is ruined and unwatchable by the script and host. I'm shocked that anyone liked it."
2,good..,"I enjoyed reading this. The book is about a fireman who starts having doubts about his job and his home life. He begins wondering if what he is doing is the right thing to do but it may cost him his job, wife and life. His strugles go on though out the book and in this furture that he lives in he is alone. Just a simple man with his thoughts wondering how different live would be if people were allowed to read books...."
2,Silly Stupid Fun!,"We bought this as a clearance item for a lot cheaper than what it's selling for on Amazon. This toy has been dropped, sat on, stepped on, etc. In other words, it survived a toddler and a little boy. It's so stupid it's fun. We've had a great time with it."
2,Lack of Leadership leads to Cannibalism by Nantucket whalers,"I found this book to be a fascinating look at the decisions people make in real life that lead to unintended consequences, or, in this case, to the actual consequences they feared the most. The author's descriptions of the Nantucket life style and insular home situations show how they men managed to hang together in even the direst of circumstances. The descriptions of whaling make this a real true life ""Moby Dick"" story. The author puts us in the boat with the whalers and in the end we understand the decisions each man took, whether it was: to abandon the boat for an island, to die of starvation, to draw straws, to eat their fellow humans. The line between what makes a person a human or an animal is explored in an insightful and compassionate way. Well Done, I hope I have written as well about the changes on youth caused by warfare in my own book ""Rough Enough""."
2,For anyone who loves great vocals,I cannot speak any french so I have no idea what she's singing about. Doesn't matter. This cd is amazing. And what is great is that you don't have to be her typical fan to like it. The production seems different on this cd. It's more of a low key affair but her vocal delivery will blow you away. Check out all the 5 star reviews this cd gets. This is one for a true music lover.
2,Plug and Go Go Go!!,"No fuss, no muss. Just plug it in the PCI slot and reboot. Windows XP installed it automatically and I was up and running.It could not have been easier unless someone else did it for me...."
1,PCKJC Review by Kelvin Lam,"This novel shows the struggle of a young boy troubled by his own faith, with problems within his own family from his father's death, to his uncle's fighting against his faith. It shows his struggle to find out what Catholicism is, the flaws of it, and which religion he should follow. It shows the heresies against Catholicism, along with its strengths. It has a sheer lacking in the amount of entertainment in the book, yet it can either strengthen or weaken your faith. It is tends to be utterly dull at times. Not a good book."
1,Very Bad transfer...,"The DVD Transfer of this movie is an absolute fiasco, and I am surprised there isn't more noise about it in the reviews. Very close to unwatchable...and I have an ugly feeling the hideously unprofessional and cheezy Troma studios is will be doing more ""transfers"" of Argento's work. It truly looks as if Troma ""studios"" ran a bad copy of a VHS tape on a television set, pointed a camcorder at the screen and then made a transfer from that tape. Disgusting. How's the movie? Who knows...you can barely see it. If Troma gets its hands on the great ""Suspiria"" there is no God."
1,Caused tiredness and confusion,"I noticed I was very tired and headachy after taking Vitex, but I read that is a common side effect and that it was temporary. After the first week, I only noticed the tiredness increasing. I would feel almost confused at times and just plain strange. When taking it during the day, one time, I completely drove past the shopping center I was going to. I'd go through these spells where I felt very heady, like I was going to pass out. I was only taking 250mg per day. I had high hopes for this as a treatment for PCOS, but I couldn't continue with it. This doesn't seem like a common result, but malaise and confusion are listed among vitex's side effects. Maybe I should have tried vitex fruit which is less potent than vitex extract, but this is something I'm not messing around with any more! Back to progesterone cream!"
2,A first-class history of the Israel-Arab conflict,"Thousands of books have been written on the Israeli-Arab conflict. Virtually all of these have been partisan. Here we have the first objective history covering the conflict from its 19th century inception right up to the 21st century. ""Righteous Victims"" is not a history of Israel nor a history of Palestine. It is a history of the conflict and it covers the subject comprehensively, objectively and with acute insight. No serious student of the Middle East can afford to ignore this book."
1,Breaks very easily,"When I received the first candle it arrived with one of the wings broken. I quickly contacted Amazon and they sent out a replacement which arrived 3 days before my daughters birthday. Unfortunately, the wing was broken on the replacement as well. Amazon quickly refunded my money so I'm not bitter, but it was disappointing to waste my time and money on a product that obviously does not travel well."
1,Too Small,Hard to tell from the picture what size this is. I thought it was much larger. It would not hold much more than a 1/2 pound of coffee. Too much space is wasted for the filter holder section.
1,Rollerbomb,"Stupid, vapid, anemic remake of the 1975 film. Buy the original instead.This film deserves zero stars."
1,Disappointed - sorry,"I went mad for this guy during the American Idol trials! Sat down and watched and cheered each week; all excited when the album came out and more importantly arrived in Ireland! But when I listened to it; he didn't sound at all like he did in American Idol.I think his song choices on this album left a lot to be desired. Where were all the brilliant songs he sang on the American Idol show? That's what I wanted to hear, that's what I would WANT to hear if I went to see him live in concert.But other than that, I wish him well and hope he takes note of this!"
1,shipping problem,"Ordered this as a wedding gift. It was shipped twice and it was broken both times. Amazon would not give the ""recipients"" credit for something else, had to go though me. Realy spoiled the gifting experience."
2,Still Amazing,"Watching Carlos Santana and his band on this DVD brings to me a special enjoyment. What an incredible harmony between him and his highly talented keyboardist Chester Thompson. This Thompson guy is absolutely genious, and the two together consist the heart and soul of the band. Just listen to the organ improvising theme of OYE COMO VA, EVIL WAYS and SOUL SACRIFICE, and you'll understand what I mean. No underestimation of other band members.. All of them are great. I rated the band 5 stars, and Arista company which produced the DVD 3 stars making a mean of 4 stars for the item. I can't believe how to produce a music DVD on the end of 2005 without a 5.1 channel sound format.I think that great Santana deserves to be listened at his utmost,and the DVD shouldn't be produced with only stereo sound. This DVD is a must for any Santana fan, good for both price and music content."
2,Tension from cover to cover,"""Of Mice and Men,"" is a gripping story about two men who are wondering through life, from dead end job to dead end job, with only each other to rely on. George, a bright man and clearly the leader of the two, and Lennie, as the book puts it ""a gentle giant,"" dream of a simple life of one day owning their own land. In a line of work that does not often lend itself to forming such close personal relationships, the two men are able to use each other as a support system to some how make both of their lives a little better.Steinbeck perfectly describes each scene placing the reader right in the action. One almost becomes the third stooge in the story. Each chapter builds upon the suspense, ultimately culminating in an ending that does not disappoint!"
1,This album sucks,All I can say is this album sucks bad!! Ghostface Killah really sucks now and his lyrics are made for ignorant black people who don't know any better.. I threw this CD out my window it sucked so bad! disgrace to music
1,Not in the same league,This movie just plain ... If you are a fan of the first two you will be sorely disappointed by this installment. It looses its sci/fi roots and edgy humor and just becomes cheesy.
1,A 2 star movie at best & what a dog,"I recorded this movie from freebie I got from dishNetwork and wow what a let down, Acting has really takening a nose drive on this one. Way to many actors in it many of them were flat out goofy and love interest has way to much collagen in her lips makes her look like she has a hockey puck in them and she came across as blond bimbo. Dialogs,talking was to fast and hard to follow way to much mumbling and confusion going on. Makes me glad I did not shell out some cash for see this dog. Hasbro should be ashamed to have their name link to it. Lastly hang on to your money you will find it at here or at some other Online store for less than price of a movie ticket."
2,Great Book,One of the best and most interesting books I have ever read. I highly recommend it to anyone.
1,Use this to estimate your projects and lose money,"The book and software indicated to me that I can build a 30 foot long 2x6 wall at 8' high for $54.00. If anyone uses this book as their only estimating tool, email me so you can build me a house for next to nothing."
2,The best of Raymond Chandler,"This book, contaning Chandlers later works, is perhaps the best collection of Chandler you can find. Sure, does not contain the better-known novels - The Big Sleep and Farewell my Lovely - but it does contain The Long Goodbye, which is not only Chandler's finest, but a great novel by any measure.Chandler lived a tough, hard-drinking life, and these later works came out of his mind with difficulty. But the quality of The Lady in the Lake and The Long Goodbye (The Little Sister is less memorable) make this collection essential.In addition, the book contains some essays and letters, including Chandler's writing on the mystery genre, which will interest any budding suspense author.In short, read this book! Read The Long Goodbye, then read it again. This is not just a great mystery, but it is also great literature."
1,So boring,I am an English teacher and getting through the book was tough. Only Nathaniel Hawthorne can make sex sound boring.
1,Very dissatified with this *thing*,"This is the first review I have ever written, but I am so annoyed with this so-called printer that I had to add my 2 cents.My last HP printer lasted for over 5 years before giving up the ghost. I was happy with its preformance. This one I have had about 2 months and I am ready to throw it out the window.The paper feeding problem is VERY ANNOYING. I find I have to fiddle for many minutes to get it to recognize there is paper in the tray. Then once it does, it has a 50/50 chance of jamming!For HP to call it a printer is almost funny, because I have yet to have it just print without problems.I am in the market for a new printer after less than 2 months!"
1,Poor quality and Customer Service- buyer beware,"Received this as a gift from my husband. He had it gift wrapped and held it for the occasion. When I opned the bracelet, we were both very disappointed. The quality was very poor and bracelet did hand nicely on the wrist. He contacted the seller through Amazon to request a refund. They refused to refund or exchange the item. Unfortunately he had not opened the item when it was received, since it was gift wrapped. He held it beyond their return window, as he was saving it to be gifted. I called the vendor myself to explain and seek a compromise. They were unyeilding, explaining that they could not return the bracelet to their vendor or restock it, so we were out of luck. Beware of the return policy with this vendor especially if it is a gift."
1,Mindless!,"The plot is God and the Devil bet on who will win, a doctor who rapes his victims before hacking them up with a chainsaw, or a victim who is on the run who can win."
2,Love My Tivo!!!!,This device is easy to install. I brought both two of these from this seller and the price is better than Tivo's. The shipping was quick. I wanted this device for a long time but couldn't seems to justify paying what Tivo was charging. I was browsing amazon and seen the same exact device's price and jumped right on it. I LOVE IT!!!
2,Good choice,"A classic is a classic, but additional features in this edition make it a great choice. Nice illustrations, too!"
1,WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!!,"WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! Gary the Snail is the best character in the cartoon. He meows, grooooowls, meows-&-growls at the same time, and can say ''No''. He plays the violin, wears a two-tone pair of Italian brogues, and reads the paper. He is a towering intellect and is granted ZEROOO role in this so-called movie! This omission has angered Gary fanatics all over the world! Any SBSP movie without Gary is sacrilege! WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!!"
1,Boring,"This book was the most boring book I have ever read. There was no point to the whole book, because all he talked about was his accomplishments and things that other people wrote about him. This book has no suspenseful or interesting parts in it. I feel that no one could ever like this book."
1,"good when it works, but garbage in two month's time","I bought two of these drives at the same time. The one is still going strong, but the other crashed, never to be revived, about six months from purchase. I returned it under warranty and SanDisk sent a replacement. It's not my drive fixed and, of course any information I had on the drive is gone. Okay, I could deal with that, but now that drive has also crashed and burned. There's no reviving, formatting or recovering my information....again. This time I trashed the drive; I'd kept good back-ups of all the information, I'm only out my original purchase price and postage to return it the first time. This is my last SanDisk purchase...fool me once, but not twice."
1,No longer worth reading,"This book is woefully out of date with respect to both struts and the extension packages that the author created and published. Most if not all are deprecated and standard struts components are available to replace them. I made the mistake of developing code for Struts 1.3 using this book as a reference and will end up rewriting the application as a result. There was probably a time where this book made sense and it may have value as a historical reference, particularly to the author's extensions. But there is no good reason to have this book as your Struts reference."
2,pleasantly surprised,"I'm not normally a big fan of comics or the movies they inspire, but i was very pleasantly surprised. Highly recommend it."
2,A+,"the book came really fast and was in great condition, I cant wait to read it i would order from them again for sure."
2,"Emo-whatever, welcome back, guys!!","I just have to say what an amazing experience it was to see Sunny Day Real Estate's first show back together in July. They played all of the songs from the new album, left stage, and came back for an encore of ""Circles"" and ""J'Nuh."" It was truly one of the most spiritually moving concerts I have ever been to. The new record is amazing and I suggest that you buy it right now."
1,Numbingly bad.,"Only in this, the age of mediocrity, could a piece of rubbish like this get made. Owen Wilson turns in one of the worst performances in recent memory. This was made strictly for the idiots who find MTV worthwhile part of our culture."
2,It's Clay all the way,I have been following Clay from the beginning and when I heard his song Invisible at the concert I could not waite for the CD to come out. Well it is finally here and I love it. He could sing the Gold Fish song and I would still love it. I think he has that Frank Sinatra make your heart melt voice. The writers need to get moving and write him some really great songs. If you like Clay you will LOVE this CD.
2,Awesome!,"Okay, in all honesty: I love this CD! I have it and listen to it all the time. Clay Aiken is a really talented and hot singer! Listening to his cd you can tell what an awesome voice he has! It's worth every penny and you'll love it. It's a must have for all Clay fans -- and even for those of you who aren't. Clay's one of the best singers out there right now and should have won American Idol. Why he didn't its beyond me, but right now it doesn't matter. It's all about his cd, his new single and his concerts!So BUY THIS CD!!!! You won't regret it. The best part of all is when you buy his cd you are supporting him. If you're a ""claymate"" and don't have this cd get it today. He totally deserves to be famous. And all of the songs on here are great for listening over and over! Plus (to all of the girls who have the hots for him): it comes with a really hot poster of him! =)"
2,"Read the suspense, imagine the space","I bougth halo 1-3 book package, so far I read the fall of reach and I am reading the flood, but I already can tell the fall of reach it's and outstabding book from eric, he refer's so many details specially in the space battles, it makes you imagine the cruisers the fights the crossfire, its exciting, I never in mi life read a book so fast, every time I decided to stop mi head did't stop imagine what will happen next or how it would look like."
2,cheapest price,I am always looking for the best prices on diapers. I like these overnight diapers - they work for us - we always use one size larger than our daily diapers and that seems to work.
1,Incorrect disc!,"I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a ""incorrect disc"" message."
2,AWESOME,This CD was well worth the wait. Clay has one of the best voices I have ever heard and it comes through loud and clear with every song on this CD. Buy it...you'll be happy you did.
1,American classic my ...,This completely predictable novel seems more like a beginner's attempt of writing a book rather than an American classic. The author treats the readers as if they completely lack a brain by stating the understood and by completely beating concepts to death (note the reference).
2,Clay Measures Up!,"This CD is composed of 12 wonderful pop ballads, that exploit the breadth and depth of Clay Aiken's amazing vocal talent. From the opening song, ""Invisible"", to the pop-country tune, ""The Way"", the Beatle-esque ""Shine"", ""This is The Night"", and the final song, ""Touch"" (suprisingly, a Justin Timberlake-style song which Clay makes his own), this CD is pure ear candy. Kudos to the producer and those behind the scenes who pulled together this entire set of songs for Clay's debut CD. It is fresh and pure enjoyment."
2,a classic,"Call me nostalgic, but this Christmas video remains one of the top Cartoons of all time. Children of all ages can relate to Charlie Brown's life as a misfit as well as his bewilderment over Christmas ""Commercialism"". His desire to be accepted and his quest for the true meaning of Christmas touch your heart.The early 2 dimensional animation is classic. Even children born with today's 3D computer animation are attracted to it. -And Vince Giraldi's music is jazz at it's classiest."
2,good book,"This book is pretty lyrical and easy to read. It's got some letdowns and some good comedy in it, and the characters are seriously flawed despite attempting to make some sense of life in their own way, through action and living it up or through trying to be more active. This feeling reverberates in the book quite often, and their is quit ea bit of melancholy. the book is evocative and conversational."
2,good product,"Its an ok value for the money, would buy from amazon again in the future. thanks for the good deal"
1,Don't bother,"This game was nothing but glitchy on my PC. I have no problem with a dozen or so other games from other companies (including Deus Ex 2, also from Eidos), but this one is a turkey. It's glitchy, the controls are too clunky, and whenever I exited the game my PC restarted. The built-in EAX support didn't work with my Sound Blaster Audigy 2 (which uses the EAX 4 drivers), I had to install the EAX 3 drivers that came with the game, which was essentially a downgrade for me.On the other hand, this game looks great and when the sound worked it was terrific. The story is pretty cool, and I was looking forward to see how it played out. The cutscenes were good, and I felt like it was as much an interactive movie as it was a game.Unfortunately, I couldn't take the bugginess, so I didn't finish the game. Avoid this one and spend your money on one of the earlier Tomb Raider titles."
2,Great! Must have it!,This book is a hands on training. It covers every aspect of the software. Excelent source for those who want to learn 3D Studio Max.
2,Also useful if you live in Europe,"You read a lot of books, when you have a relative with lung cancer. This book gives you an overview of the most common options you have, without the depressing statistics about lung cancer. If you fight for your health, statistics aren't that important after all.However, there are a lot of pages about coping with cancer 'socially', which may be important to some people, but that is information I was not really looking for. And the health system in de USA is a different from the system in Europe (dealing with doctors, insurance, that kind of things).But it is by far the best introduction book about lung cancer I have been reading so far. I keep using it over and over again. So: recommended, also if you live in Europe."
1,"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim","This book was a very poorly written effort in my opinion. Additionally, the author would have you believe that the terriorism that exists today is the fault of the U.S and the protestants that make the U.S. their home. It would seem that the author alines himself with Osama Bin Laden and those who wish to control the middle east. It's hard for me to imagine that this man is a professor at Columbia University. Instead of wasting his time here, he needs to return to his own country for the purpose of educating his own people."
1,False Advertising,"I ordered a hardcopy of this book and was sent a paperback. The seller did not even have a hardcopy in stock event though the item description explicitly said that it was a hardcopy. Had to send it back, waiting for refund - this is a hassle and I still don't have what I wanted."
1,"Good support, but expensive and not durable!","I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs. I did find them a little difficult to put on, but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was, like the other review stated...they ran the second time I wore them. For as expensive as these pantyhose are, they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer, if that is something you are looking for in support hose. They look more like tights when they are on your legs. I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade."
1,Buyer beware,"This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!"
2,Great instruction DVD,"I recently purchased both Hoopnotica Beginner Levels 1 and 2. I am new to hoop dancing and I watched both of these DVDs from beginning to end without hooping just to concentrate on the instructions. I think they are both excellent DVDs as they are very clear, organized and concise. If you are trying to decide on which one to get, I recommend that you start with the Level 1, but really you should get both. I plan to collect these as they come out, they are really that good. (Note that these aren't exercise routine DVDs - they are for learning the techniques of hoop dancing.)"
2,Cheap price good product,My parents use this and it's made by motorola. No issues with it what so ever
2,My wife loves them!,"Nice set, very soft and comfortable, they are made slightly oversized and fit a thick mattress perfectly.A few strings came off them at first washing, but no unravelling or fraying.an excellent bargain at the $12 they cost me on clearance sale."
2,Excellent,First rabbit and it works amazingly. It does things that I never expected it to do. I would definitely by another one if something ever happened to this one.
1,Terrible,I have been usage the Size 2 for my son and he is still breastfeeding and so his BMs are still pretty runny. These diapers were terrible!- the poop leaked straight THROUGH the diapers- not leaking out the sides- THROUGH! That meant that there was no way that he could stay clean through a BM! Which is very annoying.
2,A really good pair of shoes,"These are really good shoes. Great look. Good comfort. No break-in. Very sturdily built. Good price. True to size. The only thing is that, for me, these may not be for general wear. They don't breathe at all (since they are waterproof) and can get a little sweaty and uncomfortable if you are indoors for a while. Driving with these shoes has been a little difficult because there is less leeway for the ankle to move, or rather, it takes some getting used to. I am thinking I should have really bought the ""Low WP"" version."
2,workout,loved the dvd thanks Amy!! Hoping to be toned and firm by the end of this Summer!! If you enjoy step areobics you will enjoy this DVD check it out!
2,A real treasure,"My husband loves watching documentaries, but cannot sit down and read a book. Until this one! He read everyday, until he finished it, and has started reading it again, 2 months later. His dad was an Army veteran, but he would never talk about it."
2,"Great, but...","The reviewer below is right on the money. In fact, the guitar solo he mentioned is, IMHO, the ALL-TIME WORST GUITAR SOLO ON RECORD! It's an unfortunate combination of impossibly awful taste and complete incompatibility with the song. (Actually there are TWO concurrent solos, each stepping all over the other, to make it even more obnoxious.) I'd love to be able to separate the tracks to pull the ugliness out and enjoy the music. Otherwise, some fine grooves though, and soulful singing from Mr. Williams..."
1,System of a turban,"I may not be 14 or hip to what the kids today listen to. But with lyrics like ""I dont think u trust in my self righteous suicide"", a video of the lead singer wearing a shirt with a tank on it,a song called jet pilot and another song that starts out with ""there is toxicity(anthrax) in our city. Even I know its obvious. These guys support terrorsim. If you have your doubts read the back cover of their first album, it discusses how in the 21 st century the world will experience biological and chemical terrorism to combat the opression of those in foreign lands.Oh and not to mention the upside down american flag on the back of the record.Now maybe this is all just a coincidence.NahhDont support terrorism and dont buy this album"
1,AWFUL!,Fazzari massacres these compositions. He can't sing. Plain and simple. The band should be ashamed of themselves. Listen to the samples. They'll make you angry. Total garbage.
1,anthology,This book is an anthology of 3 books I had already read. I do not knowingly purchase anthol;ogies. O would not recomend this book unless yoy want all 3 books in one.
1,"Nice board, very poor quality","Pro:Nice size, a bit smaller than tournament size, slim attache.Nice colorsCon:Durability/quality is poor. Stiching on one point is defective, there is a large discoloration in the felt, and one of the dice is disintegrating."
2,Don't forget to take out this Garbage!,"I was unsure as to how Garbage planned to mutate their music to produce a whole new CD. I loved the first album, but feared the upcoming release would simply be more of the same. Fortunately, it was! I am not sure how to explain how Butch Vig and Co. manage to keep me interested from song to song other than pure magic."
2,Fabulous,The costume came fast and fit awesome. My only complaint was with the shoe coverings. They broke easily and would not stay on my daughters shoes so we ended up not using them.
1,Lot of time is wasted in describing the steps,"me and my wife are both professionals. We bought this DVD for convenience over attending classes.The information provided in the DVD is helpful. However we found it is very repetitive, lot of time is wasted. The material could be easily covered in an hour at the most 75 mins.I would not recommend this DVD."
2,Had some problems at first but now i love it,"I received my Squeem 1 month ago and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back. This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL. Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw & tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half-way covering my butt & hips. EUREKA!! What a difference this made now i'm loving it and hardly leave home without it. I originally bought the XL nude now i'm getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L. Great product, my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer."
1,$25K warranty isn't included in packaging or at APC site,"This product description is WRONG. I purchased this product because of this ""$25,000"" equipment warranty. Product received only states that the actual surge protector is under warranty and has no mention of equipment warranty. Is Amazon starting to make stuff up now?"
2,Converse tennis shoes,I purchased 2 pair of Converse Chuck Taylor tennis shoes for my granddaughter's Christmas gift. They were delivered before the projected date and were exactly what the girls wanted. I will not hesitate to order from them again.
2,Great factual read,Great factual read. Very similar to dan Browne style novel. If you like dan Browne you'll love Steve berets well written to the point novel. Great read.
2,"fun, funky patterns","I bought this book after buying Adorable Knits for Tiny Tots and knitting several items from that book. From this one I have made the teddy, the cloud pillow and am about 70% of the way through the kaleidoscope blanket (I decided that knitting 49 squares was too much like hard work and so adapted the pattern to be knit all in one go on a circular needle- its going well but maybe the squares would have been easier!). My knitting friend has also made the dolly with fabulous results. With the exception of the cloud pillow I have substituted local yarns with no problems. the only problem I have had was with yarn quantities- The cloud pillow called for six balls of expensive Rowan yarn, which was more that enough for two pillows. I plan to knit the star and moon blanket and the kitty cat jumper next. This is a lovely book with plenty of fabulous patterns."
1,Another nightmare about the remove cassette message,"I have had this camera for 18 months and about 2 months ago, it started beeping at me to eject the tape almost every time I used it. I went on-line and found that this is common with this camera for some reason. I was able to prevent major problems by removing the tape after each use, but that no longer works. Now I cannot record or watch any tape without it forcing me to remove the cassette. I was very fond of this camera until it stopped working. I am very disappointed that I will now have to buy a new camcorder (a local repairman estimated over $200 to fix it). I have a friend who has the exact same camera and he has yet to have a problem, but it isn't worth the risk."
1,why i think the book is going to be great,I think this book is really good for people who continuously tried to be one of the people out on the court.This is the perfect book to start with.
1,BIG MESS,"These diapers seem to have gone down hill fast with regards to quality. Over the past two packages (in a span of around 20 diapers) we have had two diapers burst open at night and deposit the inner crystals all over my toddler and his crib. A big mess and who knows the effects of the crystals? Also, my son has NEVER had a diaper rash and now has a severe case. Pampers Baby Dry diapers has been a good value in the past but will never use again."
1,Good for about 1.5 years....,"I bought this in November 2005, used it almost everyday without disconecting it so no wear would be put on the connectors. Last week the sound quit coming through in the right ear. Surprising since the connectors are gold plated, you would expect it to last as long as my headphones which are 7+ years old without gold plating (and still function pefect. Anyway, it was only $2.90 from Part Express when i bought it from here, but the shiping was really high. So if you buy it plan to replace it in a year in a half."
2,"A complex, multi-layered masterpiece","Unlike Dots and Loops, Sound Dust doesn't reach out and grab you at first. The album takes many listens to appreciate, but once you do, you'll realize it's a masterpiece. Microbe Hunters was the same way...hard to absorb at first, but eventually rewarding. Aside from the first track (a repetitive instrumental), every song is pure quality. Buy it, listen to it several times.....you won't be disappointed!!!"
1,Femalien,"The R rated DVD of this movie is not worth the price. It's cut to smithereens. Buy the unrated version, instead."
2,Great Book,I haven't read a book in 10 years. My New Year's resolution was to read more books and this definitely didn't let me down. The story is well written and provides great insight into the early 1900's Brooklyn.
1,Garbage.,"This movie typifies the lazy, expensive, misguided Hollywood misfires of the last 20 years, with its bargain-Blade-Runner-with-more-neon sets, poorly realized characters and jarring tonal shifts. Is it for kids? Is it for adults? A comedy? Thriller? Sci-fi? Who knows! Who cares!?Even if you completely ignore the video game origins (which this movie fouls up miserably), this movie does not work on its own as intelligible entertainment. The movie feels like a poorly directed stage play, with everyone pitching for the last row, but not campy or quotable enough to be memorable.For those of you who think this is an overlooked gem, I direct you to the climax, where Koopa basically stands in the same spot on a walkway for 20 minutes, while clichÃ©d, cartoonish ""action"" unfolds on the same recycled sets around him.Another movie that tries to be everything and only succeeds at being boring and mildly nauseating. Only watch this out of sheer curiosity."
2,The most entertaining film of the year,This movie was so entertaining. I was in stitches from laughing so much - it was so funny and enjoyable. Diane Lane was incredible in this film. She is such a good actress and here she proves that she is funny as well. This is one of the most entertaining films I have seen all year. Brilliant stuff!
2,excellent bike,"As many mentioned earlier, no stand. no instruction for assembling. I needed about one and half hours to assemble it. The box is damaged and there is a scratch on bike. But it is a good bike. I like it."
2,Invaluable Resource!,Sherry's a bit quirky but she has a teaching style that is amazing. We loved this video and learned so much.
1,SanDisk Sansa View Player MP3 Player - plays less than two hours,"While advertised as eight hours of play time, the player didn't make a two hour trip once in the three or four weeks we had it.Now just waiting to get the refund we've been notified we will receive so we can try something else, hopefully something that will live up to its advertisement this time."
2,Okay product,"I've had this steaming pitcher for a month and it is already rusting, however that can be fixed with the right cleaning product so it doesn't really bother me. This pitcher is really sleek looking and holds 20 ounces if you fill it to the top."
1,Simply not a good choice for future mathematicians,"There are a lot of good calculus textbooks out there, and many of them are better, I think, than this one. I don't know whether the authors are trying to make calculus easy & interesting. The result is that students learn more how to use the machines than the subject--mathematics itself. Students talk more math than do math!! The authors seem to thoroughly go against the classics that emphasizes the ""symbolic"" approach more than ""numerical and graphical"". Sometimes new approaches should be encouraged but I personally believe that all should do to help the students grasp the materials and enhance their mathematical thoughts. This is a book that teaches you how to learn and teach calculus."
2,Short But To-The-Point,"Very well done. I've been hoping for years that someone would work on documenting motion for artists, and this begins to fit the need. It's short, and it could have offered much more, but it is worth the money."
2,Weary in beginning,In the beginning of the book I thought that she was going into too much detail describing every scene to the tee. But let me tell you nothing would have prepared me for what happened in this book. It was full of surprizes however one thing was apparent if you know how to read into things. My suggestion is get the book! Read it for yourself and laugh to you cry. As another reader said relationships are full of surprizes!
2,My cat loves them !!!,What can I say My cat loves them so I assume they are pretty tasty.I can't say for sure because I have really not tried them myself :)
1,Never Again,"I decided to try these diapers instead of the swaddlers to save a few dollars. Needless to say that was a mistake. They claim to keep baby dry for up to 12 hours. My little one can't use these to sleep through the night (6 hours). I don't recommend these at all. Spend a few extra dollars on the swaddlers, you'll make your money back on the $ saved on extra laundry they cause because they leak."
2,One of the best cd's EVER made,"I LUV this band and these songs. My friend introduced me to this band, and after the first song i as absoloutely hooked. Wierd enough for kids, loud enough for teens, and heavy enough for adults, this cd will make anyone who listnes to it absoloutley LOVE it. There are a few songs that are a bit ""bad"" shall we say (some pretty heavy swearing), but the rest of the songs are absoloutely wonderful."
2,Very sturdy,This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have. The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new. It must be washed before wearing. The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat. But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening. The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it's good for the back as well as the front.
2,high quality,"I'll keep this short, since you don't need much explaination. This album slams harder than just about any other. You'll listen to it all the way through at max volume. It will absolutly blow your mind. If it doesn't, check your pulse...."
2,You Betta Buy This!,"What a great album! I count 9 good tracks, which is a lot better than most albums these days. Skip over #6, #9, #11, and concentrate on the good stuff. Wonderful melodies, brash sounds, singalong hooks, and you can dance to it too. Great concept: Rock + Techno + Pop = GREAT ALBUM!"
2,"Somply, Wonderful!","I asked for this cd for my birthday only knowing one song on it, ""Learning to Fly"" and I simply fell in love with the cd. The songs are wonderfully sang and written. The words really witness to you. ""Grand Scheme"" is among another of my favorites. All the songs are great. I recomend this cd highly to you if you like 4Him."
2,wish it was longer,"I loved reading about Ian and Judith again. One wish would be that it was a wee bit longer. Ahhh, Mz.Garwood please go back to historical romance!!!!"
1,More About the Book,"BloodRune is written in a unique first-person present-tense that I've never seen in another book. This gives a very interesting perspective on the story itself when told as it's happening by the characters that are there. This book follows characters more than the plot, and that's reflected by a bit of a lack of direction to begin with but is tied together once the plot is worked up to. In much the same light, there's a fair amount of content to begin with that seems pointless at the time, mere plot filler, but much of that is explained once the plot starts to come into play. BloodRune ends with a dramatic twist, leading up to the series that was intended to follow. Unique characters, carefully placed humor, realistic plot development, and a very interesting perspective make this book worth taking a closer look. A free preview of two pages can be found at the publisher's site."
2,Good Resource all things considered,"This is a good book to learn about how to use JSTL. It has an excellent reference section, and the body of the book explains how to use the JSTL tags with many good example. On the whole, a very useful, readable book. One negative: The author has a sense of humor which some might find odd, and he interjects it throughout the book; at times it's distracting. But if you can get past that, you'll find this to be a good resource."
2,Nice but not the best,"I wanted to try this moisturizer since I love Exuviance foundation. I was hoping I'd also fall in love with this skin treatment. I can't criticize anything specific, but I didn't love it. It has a nice texture, and a little goes a long way. It does make my skin feel soft, and the scent isn't too heavy. For a similar price,though, I think I prefer the Olay Pro-X or Regenerist line. Primary reason? I did have a few small break-outs after using Exuviance Restorative Complex for a couple of weeks. Did the Exuviance cause this? I'm not sure. With the easy availability of Olay, I think I'll return to that family of skin care products."
2,"The World`s Biggest, Greatest Classic R&B Album Ever...!!!","Simply a Masterpiece album, THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE, MY FAVORITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME. R.KELLY IS A MUSICAL GENIUS. HE PUTS ALL HIS HEART AND SOUL ON THIS CLASSIC. All the 19 songs are perfect blazing hot. But, my most heard are: Strip for You, Greatest Sex, I Don`t Mean It, Just Like That, Like a Real Freak, Don`t You Say No, ONE ME, I WISH & HIS REMIX, A WOMAN`S THREAT, I DECIDED, All I Really Want, FEELIN ON YO BOOTY AND THE STORM IS OVER NOW. As I said ALL ARE GEMS,ALMOST EVERY SONG COULD EASYLY BE A HIT SINGLE FO` SURE.BUY IT NOW. GET 3,4,5...COPIES IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY THAT COST. REMEMBER ALSO TO GET ""THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY"" ALBUM, I HEARD THAT IT WILL BE MAYBE THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR."
1,BOOTLEG - DO NOT BUY!,"For whatever reason this deplorable bootleg has not been pulled from the market, nor has bootleg vendor OZIT been sued yet. If you want to hear the real, legitimate, officially released BAT CHAIN PULLER, please buy the edition that the Zappa Family Trust is releasing as of February 2012. Don't say you weren't warned about this shoddy ripoff!"
1,"Amazing performance, substandard songs","During the run of ""American Idol,"" I was just like most of you--riveted to the show week after week because of Clay Aiken's astonishing voice. On the show, he sang and excelled in a variety of musical genres. However, on ""Measure of a Man,"" the producers have done Clay a disservice by giving him only mediocre ballads to sing. I kept hoping for at least one uptempo song--or funky song--or even funny song, to display Clay's amazing range and playful personality. I guess I'll have to wait for a concert DVD to get a full-fledged dose of Clay to rival his AI performances, because this CD doesn't deliver."
2,We love baby dry!,"We are strictly a Pampers family. We used swaddlers until my son grew out of size 2-3s then we went directly to cruisers. We had a few leakage issues with cruisers, when my son would roll to his belly in the middle of the night, but were happy with them in general. A few friends of ours had been using baby dry's and metioned that they loved them (and that they were a little cheaper than cruisers!) so we decided to give them a try. And we LOVE them. We have not had one overnight leak! The only complaint that I have is that the tabs are made a little cheaper than swaddlers & cruisers, and a few of them have ripped right off as I'm fastening the diaper. I've just learned to be a little gentler with them, and we haven't had a problem since. Overall, I give them an A!"
1,Constantine the not-so-great,"Is this movie a joke? A psychic guy running around in LA, killing demons with a crucifix-shaped gun. At one point, he kills a whole bunch with the aid of holy water...coming out from the sprinkler system! A Black voodoo priest called Papa Diavolo or something to that effect. Lucifer is on bad terms with his own son, named Mammon. The archangel Gabriel has a fall out with God and looses his wings. And no-no-no, you can't commit suicide, because if you do, you automatically go to Hell. Chain smoking is another sure method. And Heaven looks like...the Manhattan skyline!Once again, is this a joke?""Men in Black II"" were better."
1,Awful,"I'll admit right up front that I am stupid. I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing, endless prose that Hawthorne uses. I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale. A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood!!! It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word ""Classic"" stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it. Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was ""meaty"" (whatever that is), ""deep"", and ""powerful""; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this. This book has no place in a high-school English course; it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru, and then try to unravle."
1,Disappointing book. Not what I expected......,"Just another book with huge text and lots of wasted space (that makes you think you are getting a lot of reading material).Unfortunately, not much info in this book. If you are looking for a simple, down-to-earth useful book, this really isn't it.Perhaps the other book I ordered, ""Healing Secrets of the Native Americans: Herbs, Remedies, and Practices That Restore the Body, Refresh the Mind, and Rebuild the Spirit"" [Hardcover] will have more useful info. If it ever gets here that is :(My verdict? ""Secrets of Native American Herbal Remedies: comph GT Native amern Tradition Using Herbs Mind/Body/Spirit Connection for ipvg (Healing Arts)"" [Paperback] is a complete waste of money."
2,Fabulous acting & soundtrack...you must see this movie!,"I saw this movie this summer, and I was absolutely blown away. Not only is the acting fantastic (especially by Franka Potente) but the subject matter was enthralling. Think ""Sliding Doors"" with an overdose of adrenaline. The concept of the movie (how would life be different if I hadn't run into that person?) encouraged hours of discussion among my friends. Besides the intellectual part, this movie is highly entertaining and there isn't enough dialogue for the subtitles to detract from the action. A must-see!"
2,Anger Workbool,A friend suggested this book - I have gained a whole new insight to some of the issues I have been dealing with in my life. This book has helped me put a lot of my life experiences in perspective and has helped me understand myself and others so much better. Even if you don't think you have anger issues (which I didn't) this will definitely have an impact and be effective in understanding anger and it's complexities. A must read!!
2,Best DVD I Ever Own,"Well, I'm a batman fan. And this is for the one disc set. Heard there were problems with two-disc set but really doesn't concern me because I'm more interested in the movie than the extras. This movie contains a great extra, namely the first scene of The Dark Knight. I actually have to upgrade my dvd software to play that because it was so new and I'm glad I did because the picture was so sharp and clear. Begins cannot even compare. As a movie, you either love it or not. As a product, you cannot go wrong with blu ray. Once you go blu ray you never go back."
1,quit working after a month,"Well, it was a good deal and seemed to work well for a month! But after the stated time it quit. I noticed that the charging/battery guage on the tool bar was flickering back and forth and noticed a quiet humming sound coming from the power adapter. Since I live in Eastern Europe and someone brought this here from the US for me to use as a second adapter (to use at work) it will be hard to return. Maybe it was a fluke, but now I'm down to the original adapter and no backup. Hope you have better luck."
1,Not a shining star,"Recognizing this is a $6 ""First Guide,"" overall, it pretty much provides what one would expect: a decent dry survey of constellations, planets, and other astronomical features with some truncated star maps. And it's in a slim handy-to-pocket volume. However, two aspects make this guide subpar, even for the price. First, in a few places they did a poor job of updating the 1988 edition to this 2006 version. For instance, we are told to expect another exciting Leonid meteor shower in 1998 or 1999 (page 62). Second, they should make it clear - on the cover - this guide is geared to the northern latitudes. This little fact is buried in the third paragraph of the introduction."
1,Sylvia brown should be imprisoned,sylvia brown is a fake. She practices a technique called cold reading. Fake. and I would say evil for preying on people
2,great low cost quality,"This is a small bodied laser printer which ""flies"" and is a cost saver for the everyday text printing that needs no fancy color etc. Very happy, easy to use, easy to install, cartridges life makes for inexpensive running. Perfect for the student, home office and personal use. A good looking unit."
1,A little lacking,"I had to get this book for my advanced calculus class. There are 3 issues I have with this book. First, that the material in any given chapter gives what is needed to work most, BUT NOT ALL, of the problems at the end of the given chapter. Second, having solutions to selected exercises is a good tool to have, and if an instructor disagrees, he or she can just assign problems that don't have solutions given. Not all students would use those solutions, but it's nice to have to verify one is on the right track. Third, the author does not explain things as clearly as other authors do. He (assuming Edward is male) could have explained things much better without adding a single word to the text. I find myself frequently referring to 'How To Prove It' by Velleman, since Velleman explains things much better. In short, this book is not the worst I've seen, and I would give this book 3 stars, were it not for the price."
1,He is a good writer but...,"Ross Leckie writes exciting, thrilling storys, but a writer should not work in historical fiction if he doesn't know anything about the period is writing. Every time ross goes for some detail...it's COMPLETELY WRONG...he dont even know that a primus pilus (primipilus) is the first centurion of the first cohort. If you want to read historical novels about rome, try Steven Saylor or the marvelous Colleen McCullough. Mr. Ross, You don't have to be a scholar to write historical fiction, but please...read one or two books before you write your novels."
2,A Life Changing Book,"I read and reported on this book for my Probability and Statistics class back in college. It permanently changed the way that I view and evaluate polls, ratings, and statistics that we are bombarded with on an almost daily basis. Innocculate yourself! Buy this book and master it- you won't be disappointed."
2,Great value,After reading the previous reviews we decided to take a chance and purchase. We're glad we did. The unit is sturdy and solid and it's a bargain compared to others we've seen first hand. Would buy again without question.
2,Fun for a while...,"We bought this for my daughter for her 3rd birthday & she really loved it at first. She especially liked it when her older cousin showed her that she could put other small toys in the castle & pop them out and across the room. However, she lost interest soon after & I haven't seen her play with it in the 3 months since her birthday."
2,Well worth the price,"Gave it 4 stars because it doesnt have any identifying marks to indicate a brand, otherwise, for the price you couldnt do better any where else.It bolted up almost perfectly, had to pull one corner slightly to line up with the mounting hole, but this was not hard to solve.Packaging was a little scanty for a heavy product, but again, for the low price it came in great condition, just a few scratches because the box was broken in a few places. But this product is going under my car, not to be seen and polished.Very good value, I would recomend this to anyone who is in the market for an inexpensive hitch receiver."
1,Confusing and Convoluted,"As a sophomore in high school nearly 10 years ago, I had a terrible experience with this book. The plot was confusing and complicated by tough vocabulary and grammar. In the version I had borrowed from the school, the ""long sentence"" was (I'm pretty sure) around 7 pages (5x7 size pages).Recently, I tried to pick it up again, convinced by my wife, who had liked reading Faulkner. I found it only slightly easier, with no real improvement. I believe that the problem stems from something that Douglas Adams had once said: ""I'm trying to be literate, not literary."" I get the feeling that Faulkner was trying to create literature as an artform, rather than try to convey his story to the masses.I can appreciate that many people love this story, and that it is a literary masterpiece, but I cannot say that I think it is good."
2,ERB Finally Makes LIBRARY OF AMERICA w/A Princess of Mars!,"This Library of American edition of A Princess of Mars is a beautiful book! It's about time Edgar Rice Burroughs, one of the USA's bestselling authors for about 20-25 years starting in 1914, had one of his books published by the Library of America. LOA has also published Tarzan of the Apes.I have the 1st edition of A Princess of Mars, by McClurg, and this Library of America edition is close (but not quite) a fascsimile 1st edition. All five of the original illustrations are present, but they are not on ""coated"" paper like they are in the original 1st edition. The dust jacket is beautiful.I short, if you're looking for a very nice edition of this book, buy this one!Before closing, note that I also give the story itself 5 Stars! And the second and third books of the trilogy, The Gods of Mars and The Warlord of Mars, are equally as good!Read ERB's Barsoom series for a thrill!"
2,Great fit,"I loved they way they fit and perform. I am an avid outdoors man. They handle the snow, ,mud and tree branches great. Would recommend this product to anyone with pets or outdoors person."
1,Disapointed,"WARNING! THIS IS NOT THE CROCODILE DENTIST GAME THAT YOU GREW UP WITH! I had the idea to buy Crocodile Dentist for a Christmas present for a five year old boy. I remember playing the game when I was younger and I loved it! (the original toy has teeth that you pull out of the croc's mouth and the crocodile was atleast 3 times larger then this pewny little thing). Not only did they change how you play the game, but the size as well...what a jip...shame on them!"
1,I can't believe she wrote this!,"LJS's other books are great, but this one was so boring! There was absolutely nothing dangerous about Gillian and David being in love, and that's the whole point of this series! Also, it's kind of unlikely that someone could just cut her hair and wear makeup and then suddenly be popular. I didn't like Gillian at all. She's superficial, not to mention being Little Miss Weakling. David was an idiot because he fell for her as soon as he saw her with short hair and makeup. Let's get realistic! He cheated on the SATs and Gillian still wants to support him. Plus, he's BORING! LJS's other books are all 5 stars in my opinion, but I hated this one."
2,"Surprisingly good, and interesting for non-believers too","I am a huge fan of Sergio Castellitto, and as a frequent visitor to Southern Italy I wanted to learn more about the life of Padre Pio. Although I am an atheist, I enjoyed this film very much, in much the same way that I enjoy visiting churches in Italy. A surprisingly good, interesting film, that grabbed my interest until it ended nearly four hours later! I recommend this movie to anyone interested in Southern Italian culture."
2,Great Whodunit!,"I was introduced to this charming little mystery while a schoolboy, and the enthusiasm of my teacher (Agnes Hay) resulted in a lifetime passion for British history. If you're such a buff, you will thoroughly enjoy this fictional modern-day examination of the Murder of the Princes in The Tower of London. Delightful---you'll want to curl up and enjoy it all in one sitting!"
1,?????,I never ordered this book so I can't possibly review it. I'm at a loss to understand how I'm connected to this title since I have never used the Kindle.
1,Creative could be creative,"I bought this player for my nephew(age15) one year ago. After the first month it wouldn't work. called and they refused a new one, only rebuilt. OK. Sent it back and 4 1/2 months later it stopped playing again. They refused him any replacement, partial payment to fix it, no solution to the problem. I am sitting here with this $179.MP3 player that doesn't work, that I can now get for $119 and am not sure what to do with it. Do I throw it away, can it be fixed(again). I would not buy any Creative product again. EVER"
1,Exceptionally Poor Quality Reproduction,"The 1968 BBC performance of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" was terrific. Unfortunately, as others have noted by others here, the quality of this reproduction of that performance is abysmal. Absolutely abysmal. THe color is uneven and faded, and the sound uneven as well. It is most unfortunate that this fine production by a sterling cast should be so degraded in this edition. This is a movie which really is in want and need of a proper treatment.This version is not such a treatment."
1,NOT A GOOD SPIN FOR PRESLEY,"This is not Presley's best vehicle but by this outing he was not being allowed to act anyway so he appears to be just going though the motions. The movie songs are not a real treat either, he seems to be singing to everyone including his enemies. (Where does the music come from when he sings anyway). When asked to do this movie Presley should have ""JUST SAID NO""!!!"
2,"Excellent movie, poor quality DVD, poor quality video","My wife and I really enjoyed this delightful movie about two friends and their developing relationship. You will have to stick out the first 10 - 20 minutes as this entertainer has a slow start, but ultimately it's worth it.We were very disappointed in the quality of the DVD as well as the video. It was comparable to an ""OK"" video tape. The sound quality is fine, but the ""extra"" information isn't. The ""shame on you"" goes to The Richard Diercks Company, Inc., and Simitar for taking such a fantastic medium and reducing it to an example of ""what not to do"" in DVD production, development, and video transfer."
1,"It was ghostwritten, duh!","Hello people. First of all, Naomi Campbell did not write this book. It was written for her. She has admitted this in interviews. Why would anyone want to read a novel written by a supermodel anyway. I guess people who read books authored by Fabio would dig it"
1,very dissapoined,"item shuts off before cooking correctly, 10 mins in bun warmer turns buns crunchy, item has been re-released so maybe that one is better."
2,perfect cooker,"I tried Panasonic, Tiger and of course, microwave cooker too, this one is like a Ferrari of cookers, I set the timer to have oatmeal in the morning and perfect rice (white, brown, pink and black) in the evening, life is too short, just get it and enjoy."
2,Terrible Tragedy Wonderfully Told,"Philbrick deserves the praise given to Into the Heart of the Sea. In giving a historic account of the true story that gave inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Philbrick unveils the world of the Nantucket whaling industry and the fate of one unfortunate crew. For a history book, this is a rich page-turner that is uncommon in its historic depth and compelling narrrative."
2,NOTHING LESS THAN 5 STARS,WOW--WOW--WOW---GREAT BOOK---WHAT A CLASSIC---CAN YOU BELIEVE THATIT WAS WRITTEN IN 1869??? YEARS & YEARSAHEAD OF ITS TIME. GREAT READ.
1,Not a very thorough book,"This book has some excellent reviews. As a student that has studied a few other languages, including OOP languages, I felt that this was the least helpful of all starting books that I've picked up. The code examples do not give you any inkling of how a real Java program may be used. The features of the Java language are introduced without explaining why they are needed and how they are actually used in real programs. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would like a clear example of the Java language."
1,"Waste of money-""master""","The system required a check in the rating box so I gave it a one, which is probably two too many. I have tried/owned two of these devices. The concept is good, but that is the end of the line for this product. As someone else noted the bands are not strong enough to withstand even an attempt to put your finger thru the finger holes. I even continued to try and use mine after the first hole tore loose with continued failure of the bands. At the price even if used as a squeeze ball it is too expensive."
2,squeem cincher,"Love this. I had been looking in I don't know how long for this kind of product. I've had 2 babies so far and haven't found a product like this. I had an idea of what I wanted which was kinda like a coursette, but without all the wires showing or nothing rolling up. I came across this squeem cincher and had my doubts, but I've had it for a week already (I ordered all 3, black & beige waist cincher and beige body shaper that has straps)and I've already got used to wearing it everyday, it's pretty comfortable and best of all it gives you a nice shape and flat belly look. I love it, now I'm just hoping it will help me in losing some inces from my waist. I've read that it can last up to over a year, so deffinitly worth the money. Would recommend this to everyone."
1,Doesn't close properly,"This case does provide some protection for my Palm, but it doesn't close well or stay closed... I've ended up using it with a rubberband around it."
2,ChiRunning is Excellent!,"After reading the book, my husband and I will take Danny Dreyer's class this year. Sounds very intriguing!"
2,"""Sleuth"" was actually released in '73 NOT '68......","This film was actually released in 1973, not in 1968 as stated above. It simply is one of the greatest films ever made. A real suspense roller coaster ride! If you've never seen it- you're in for a real treat. See this one, then see ""Deathtrap"" also written by Anthony Shaffer and also starring Michael Caine. If you love one, you'll love the other!"
2,truly beautiful,"Marie Curie's youngest daughter Eve has given us a gift by writing this biography of her mother. Eve manages to let us into her mother's private world while inspiring our full respect of her privacy. Madame Curie and her husband Pierre exemplify the meaning of the word integrity - a rarity, especially in our culture of constantly searching for fame and wealth at all cost. I will read this book multiple times like visiting a friend and learning a bit more about this remarkable person each time."
2,Measure of a Man Measures Up,"I love Clay Aiken, and yes, I could probably listen to him sing the phone book. BUT, this album is truly fantastic, IMO. My favorite song changes daily, even hourly, and I love every track on the CD!! I can't remember this happening since Carole King's Tapestry, umpteen years ago! I love romantic, sing-along-able songs and this CD is loaded with them. Not enough edge, some critics are grousing?? Hey, there's more nerve-grating edge than I can bear in today's music world; give me more, more, more of this kind of music, and I'll buy as much as I can possibly afford, for myself and for gift-giving!"
1,Tedious collection of stories about a goat.,"If you are like me, and thought the anthologies of this series were just ok. Then don't bother with this book. It is another anthology and it is by far the worst of the lot. I am sure the writers thought that these stories about the antics of a goat were hilarious, I however found them tedious and after I was on page 100 and the book was STILL going on about domestic farm life and the antics of a perfectly ordinary goat I just couldn't go on any further. Please no more anthologies. Maybe I can give my copy to the library to keep someone else from wasting twenty dollars."
1,Lower Than Low,"After finishing The Thread That Runs So True by Jesse Stuart, I sit here to give you my review on this book. Even though the book didn't catch my attention that much it had its ups and downs. The only thing that caught my attention while reading this book was how he fought back against the ""man"" and got his job back, but then he stuck it to them at the end. As for the down points of the book it would have to be the rest of the book. I could not in a million years honestly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book to read."
2,Interesting and thought provoking book on development!,This book has given me some insights on how to solve problems either individually or as a team member. I'm not quite ready to accept all of the ideas but it does give me something to think about! I really liked the fact that it contains both theory and practical advice for both developers and managers!
1,Leaked after 4 hours,"We accidentally bought pampers dry instead of cruisers diapers, so we decided to try them. I immediately noticed the odor of urine. When out with gramma, they leaked after 4 hours of wear. We normally use cruisers and they have provided us consistent coverage and have never failed. Cruisers seem to cover more surface area and last for 12 hours through the night. I also do not notice the urine smell as soon as the diaper becomes wet with cruisers. We will be using cruisers from now on."
1,"George, Lenny, and some dead mice.","This book was required reading in high school, and we all made fun of it. I guess it's an O.K. book but I don't recall it having much of an impact other than humor value. But I'm not a big Steinbeck fan. I guess we all have our prejudices."
1,Femalien,A soft adult movie. Good to watch once if you are in the mood for that type of movie.Save your money and get something else.
1,A boring disappointment!,"Her first book was a real page turner and I couldn't wait for this one to come out. This was a sleeper. The ocean voyage went on forever. I felt like I was actually on the voyage with the voyage never ending. I couldn't wait to get of the ship myself. The story line at the castle was a pick-me-up, but you had to read several hundred pages before you got there. I was extemely disappointed in this book and the only reason I finished it was because I didn't want to see the money I spent on the book wasted. The scottish dialect was also very distracting and I had to keep reading passages over and over to get the just of it. Save your money."
2,"Masterful rock, brilliant melodies","Still Listening to this CD nearly 2 years later. Great, memorable tunes that are standing up to the test of time for me. I'd say, with out a doubt, that if you're a rock fan who likes great melodies, this CD is a definitive must-buy for your collection if you don't have it already...as a matter of fact, even if you have it already, buy it again!!! It's that good. :)"
1,Eastern Western,"Entertaining, low buget western. Plot a little hard to follow. Not exactly Terence Hill's best movie. Watch it."
2,love it,"The amount of heat it gives to your drink definitely depends on the glass, and whether you have a lid.One day I had a relatively flat-surfaced mug with a plastic lid on top. It kept it so hot after about 5 hours that I couldn't even drink it quickly!"
2,The Isaiah Effect: Decoding the Lost Science of Prayer and Prophecy,Very insightful and interesting. Gregg Braden is offering the world a hope for peace. This book transends all religion and offers unity to all people.
2,Informational,"This book is a great resource book. Not only for young readers but for anyone who want to know the most significant stories in Greek Mythology. This book makes a good basic reference for any history class. Anyone can learn easily from this book because it is easy to read, yet you receive a lot of information. It also includes colorful illustrations that giulds the reader through.This book includes sections such as: ""Mother Earth and Her Children"", ""The Gods and Foddesses of Mount Olypus"", ""Zuez and the Creation of Mankind"", and ""Triumnphs of the Gods"". It has such stories as: Prometheus and His Gift to Man, Pandora, Echo, Medusa, Jason, Odysseus, and much more.A personal favorite of mine is the story of Jason. One man fell for the love of a youthful princess, and tempted to leave his wife, Medea. Medea spent much of her money and prepared a feast for Jason. The revenge was sweet.... I can't tell you the rest. Buy this book, its far too interesting."
2,Halley will ROCK your world,I really love this CD. Halley's songwriting and lyrics combine an incredible emotional depth with a powerful rock and roll sound that will blow you away! These songs have a groove that will make you wish you were dancin' in a club when you listen to them. You'll want to listen again and again to catch every word of the soulful lyrics.cerrato@ptechinc.com
1,Where is her tell-tale wit?!,"I was so disappointed with this book! I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's books under the name SK and have read all of them many times, but this was the first book I'd read written under her name Madeleine Wickham. I thought the story was incredibly boring. There is no humor and no one is remotely witty! The characters were all one-dimensional and not lovable at all like her other female heroines. Nothing happened and the pace was unbearably slow. I plan to read other books under the name Madeleine Wickham because the woman herself is a fabulous writer, but I didn't see her regular spark in Cocktails for Three at all."
1,Stinks jams all the time,Jams with 2 pages jams with 10 pages. I basically have to sit here and babysit the scanner the whole time. I could scan my documents faster one page at a time on a regular scanner. Returning it as we speak.
1,Relaxing viewing time,A DVD of clear good photography and quite pleasant to watch but a little embarrasing in family company. Really only suitable for watching in private.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this game at a reduced price and still feel like I got ripped off. The controls in the PC version are an absolute nightmare and make what could have otherwise been a decent game horrible. Sometimes you feel like you have no control whatsoever. Good thing two successful movies have been made about this game otherwise EIDOS would've been out of business with this horrendous offering. In fact I'll think twice before purchasing anything with the EIDOS name or CORE DESIGN name attached to it.
1,Unrealistically Small,"Even for a small woman such as myself, these wrist weights are so tight I can barely cram them on at all... let alone keep them on and exercise without damaging my skin! These should be advertised as weights for a child because they do not fit an adult - even a small slim adult."
1,"Bulky, feels gross, not worth ordering","I read up on belly-wrapping after my c-section and bought a couple compression tank-tops from Wal-Mart, which worked nicely. I wanted something without straps and something with more compression and purchased the Squeem Perfect Waist on Amazon after reading rave reviews. When I received it and tried it on, it felt disgusting on my skin. It was uncomfortable and totally noticeable (even without a super-tight or thin shirt on), especially when I sat down. The seams and the boning are all very noticeable, and the rubber makes clothes catch and stick in a really weird way, like something would stick to you if you were really sweaty. I have wore corsets for years, and this is by far the grossest feeling and least comfortable thing I have ever put on my body. I returned it immediately."
1,Incompatible with Kindle,"Make sure you view the sample first. Most of the characters particular to Spanish and linquistics show up as gibberish and on most pages the formatting seems to be lost. It is obvious that no one at the publisher even glanced at this to see if it worked when it was converted. Amazon can share responsibility. At the time of this review Kindle developers are still exclusively Anglo-centric. I hope they eventually see the value in adding some foreign language support (yes, Amazon, there are some people that read Spanish in the United States...)."
2,A very palatable foray into SciFi.,"No spiritual experience like the Flat Earth, but I was won over by Esther's determination & vulnerability. A reminder of our humanity."
2,Old favorite,"i first read this book back in the 1980s and loved it. Unfortunately, I lent the book to a friend and never got it back. Always wanted to read it again but I could never find it in any stores. Was able to find it on Amazon, ordered it and thoroughly enjoyed rereading it."
2,"Excellent content, Very easy reading, Historically correct!","I really enjoyed this book. The story was easy to follow, but very interesting. I enjoyed the detail put into the historical facts and character descriptions very much. It was nice to have the author describe in detail at the end where the actual fact ended and where the fiction began. You really understood why Emily was confused and felt for the country at the loss of the President. I would highly recommend this book for everyone from middle school age thru adult!"
1,Terrible,"This is just terrible...I bought the CD after hearing ""Chop Suey"" and ""Aerials"" over and over and over again on the radio and thinking that maybe this band had grown up a little bit. But no, it's still mostly pointless thrash to even more pointless lyrics. A few bright spots shine through - ""Atwa"" and ""Toxicity"" actually have melodies, which is a welcome departure from the noise that permeates the rest of the album.I guess it's rough being a heavy metal kid these days. I mean, Tool is practically the only decent band out there, and they don't exactly put out zillions of albums. But there's gotta be something better than Korn and System of a Down, yeesh."
2,I loved this book,"I read several reviews on this book already, and feel that what I have to say about this book has already been said. I loved this book, and found it to be quite the page turner."
1,Disappointment,"I ordered this bed for a visit by my 4 year old granddaughter. We had to add air to the bed every morning. I had this experience with another brand, but hoped this one would be better. Definitely NOT worth the money."
2,The best of the Mad Max triolgy,"The Australian dialog was dubbed because it was believed by the director that the Aussie dialog wouldn't be understood by American audiences. This is by far the best of the trilolgy. The leader of the motorcycle gang is absolutely frightening. I think the dubbing and the orchestrated soundtrack actually ADDS to the 'alien' feel of the movie. We are watching cultural shock where ANYTHING goes, and it keeps you on edge throughout the movie. FOUR stars ONLY because it doesn't include the original Australian dialog. The sequels are wannabes and don't deserve a SINGLE star."
1,It stopped working after a few weeks,"It worked well for a few weeks, but then the battery of my iBook G4 stopped being re-charged."
1,Broke after a week,"A tooth fell out but could still play it. Then another tooth fell out (can't replace) so made the game even less playable. Also, it was really tiny and more like a travel size which I did not expect for the money."
1,Paper Feed Issues-AGAIN,"At the risk of repeating everythingeveryone else has already said, pleaseread past reviews.The expense I haveto go through just to get **1** pageto print is absolutely ridicously!I end up going to Kinkos half the time.Deep regrets about this one!"
2,A Different Collection of Early Stuff,"This is among the first Ellington CDs I owned, and remains among my favorites. It presents a nice survey of earlier material, with many of his greatest hits as well as some less familiar tunes (i.e., ones you don't find on every collection of early Duke). Ivie Anderson's vocals really shine, especially on ""It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)"". Not every song was destined for greatness, but the lyrics to ""Love is Like a Cigarette"" are a hoot! The sound is decent considering the age of the recordings."
1,Painful,"This was one of the most boring books i've ever read. Unfortunately i did not give up on Hawthorne after reading this novel, that was a mistake. I'd pass on this one if i were you, if you must read this for school I highly suggest getting a summary online."
1,rotten to the core,"rotten to the core , rotten to the core , rotten to the core and oh yes, did i say ROTTEN TO THE CORE !!!!"
1,Absolutely NOTHING Funny !,This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. There is ZERO humor. All the characters are boring and completely humorless.What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Could be a lot better!!!,"Where do I start, how about I hate these diapers!! This gel stuff leaks out of them, all the time. They don't last long on active babies. Not to mention that I have to clean up leakage. Try another brand please!!"
1,avid reader,BORING. this book should have been a short story. i am shocked that people liked it so much.
1,Wrong Item,The seller sent the wrong item and has never sent the item ordered. Said I needed to pay to ship the wrong item back but that he did not have the item ordered. Very disappointed.
1,Poor shipping,"Covers where not on tight, or taped, leaked all over everything, including the two video games they brilliantly packed with it and the polish does not come off easy, everything is slimey, never mind that half the bottle is empty. I thought it was a set in a gift box but it was just thrown in a regular box, tipped in every direction. The cloth and sponges also had product all over them. Very disappointed and I've always had great experiences with Amazon."
2,This really works,"My chihuahuas have been so much better since I have been using comfort zone. they still get frightened during a severe thunder storm, but are much better than they used to be. And there is no more separation anxiety. Hope this continues to work for them as I will keep on purchasing it."
1,Not 8 just 4!,They are good but it's not a set of 8 just 4! So I was dissapointed because wanted to use all 8 and because of the price (twice more expensive that it seemed).
2,A great office work horse,"I work out of my home and just needed a good old-fashioned, fast, B/W printer. This printer spits out pages at a very fast pace, it prints clearly, the toner lasts a long time and (knock on wood) it has not jammed in the year I have owned it! The only draw back is I can't figure out how to make it print labels on envelopes. (Which could be user error)."
1,Destroying a great comic book for the sake of Keanu Reeves.,"Constantine is a very bad adaptation of the Comic book called Hellblazer and when I say bad, I do mean bad. It really desecrates what the comic book stood for and shows that Hollywood only cares about themselves, not the fans. Keanu Reeves literally gives the worse performance of his career in this film and most of the actors around him follow his path. Only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou gives good performances in this heap of junk because they at the very least tries their best with the very bad script that they had to work with while Keanu and the rest of the actors ham it up to the hill.See it for their performances alone"
2,Our Children Were Entranced,I have two children. They both loved watching the DVD. It seemed the perfect pace and had a good mix of entertainment and education. I was never able to keep them occupied as well with Baby Einstein. Great product!!!!
2,a good read for the golf nut,"Feinstein's books are always a good read and this one is no exception. If you want to know more about what it takes to put on a major golf tournament, this is your book."
2,Underground classic,"This is a complex, slow, mesmerizing film. Brando gives on of his best performances (see also Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, The Godfather and Apocalypse Now). Without Brando this film would have been utterly boring. It's the kind of film you have to watch a few times in order to make sense of everything. The film just starts and you have to put the pieces together--and character motivation is rather difficult to figure out. In fact, although this film is a good film, it's confusing as to why the characters do what they do. If you love Brando and Bertolucci, I'd recommend seeing this film. If you want to learn technique and style of acting--this is a very good film. I don't think we'll see another actor like Brando who gives memorable performances such as he does in this film."
1,Poltical dullness,"In this pathetic excuse of a cd and this band is nothing more than a public enemy/RATM (Which I Don't like either except their first album), Rip-Off without the honest truth of the worldIf this band is against america, then play someplace elseDull and uninspired.Nu Metal is Garbage"
1,Bad quality,Installation and use was easy and good. But the quality of the product was really bad and it was going loose and stopped working in between.
2,Makes me feel younger and more energetic,Great on any food that has a salty taste. I don't recommend on cereal or sweet things like in shakes.
1,"Nice sound, poor construction.","I got these last December-05. The molded plastic that holds the ear cups onto the headband started to crack (right at the L/R labels). They eventually crumbled and fractured, causing the cups to fall off. I taped one side up and the other failed as well. I have no doubt that if I replace these, the same thing will happen. My complaint is for $300 I expect something other than soft plastic holding these together at the stress points."
1,bad,"got a different pattern and the dye fades on everything even me, even after 5 washings do nor waist your money"
2,Enjoyable memoir,"I just got this book and I am having a wonderful time reading the anecdotes of life in Victorian New York with an eccentric father. The humor is gentle and quiet, if you want outlandsih jokes the this is not the book for you.Of course, some of the customs and actions of the characters may seem odd by modern standards but we must remember that everything changes with time and in 150 years, people may look back at our culture and wonder if we were crazy.Still, in spite of its age, the humor of the book has held up remarkably well. Perhaps we all know a ""father"" type, an eccentric and bossy person who is somehow endearing nonetheless.So, don't obsess over the un-politically correct attitudes of the time covered, just enjoy the quiet humor and learn about a time gone by."
1,stupid student review by gabriel c,Romeo and Juliet is a story about to lovers that meet at first sight. The biggest problem they have together is that both of the families have been fighting and hate each other since they both have been born. It all started when Romeo been depressed ever day moping around and feeling sad all of the time because he loved Rosaline and she did not love him back. So one day Romeos cousin told him about this party and that Rosaline would be there so they left and Romeo saw Juliet there and followed her to her house and both exchanged thoughts about each other and decided that they will get married but secretly. So they had to come up with a plan to pretend that Juliet was died so the can get married and the planned failed and they both ended up killing themselves. Play was very stupid it sucks no one should read it because there is no point of reading this because all this play is taking up your time.
1,A complete waste of time!!!,"I've been a member of a book club for several years now, and as a group we rated thisbook a ""1"". A ""1"" in our rating means ""a waste of time"". We've never rated a book thislow in all the years I've been reading with them. I was very disappointed!"
2,Transdescent!!!!!,"I am in 9th grade and I am 15 years old, but there is something you do not know about me. I was recently touched by means of words in merely a book. No more than three weeks ago I finished this book, and I must admit that while reading the book, it did not grasp me. Yes, it was able to keep me engaged in the novel and continue reading, but it was not my favorite. That is just the begining. The last chapter touched me in a way I could never imagine possible. Even though I did not rate this five stars, I am sure many of you would. I am sure many of you would rate this ten stars if given a chance. There is so much for one to explore and ponder within this novel, it is fraught with questions. I believe this book can not be missed and I do not usually say this, because I am one to believe that not all people have the same taste for books, as all people do not have the same taste for chocolate, and I recomend this to everyone. The themes are as thick as crunchy peanutbutter."
1,Did not work for me! Ni una vez me sirvio!,"No me ha servido para interpretar ni un sueno y los que he tenido en el pasado no concuerda la descripcion con lo sucedido despues. Este libro me ha desilucionado, pues soy una persona que he tenido varios suenos premonitorios. Ademas mi prima tiene otro libro y cuando lo he consultado me ha dado mejor resultado pero lamentablemente no esta en Amazon."
1,Voivod sounding like Exodus?,"I gave this record a few listen and unfortunately it was not to my liking. This album is NOT what Voivod is supposed to sound. Eric Forrest brought in a ""death metal"" like voice into the band, Piggy and Away composed most of the music. This album is kinda like a re-hash on 'War and Pain' with all the ""death metal-esque"" vocals and has very poor mix. The mix sounded like all the guitars, bass and drums are overlapping Eric Forrest's vocals. You can bearly hear him singing. This album is pretty sloppy to my liking. Eric Forrest's singing is unlike Snake and his bass techniques are unlike Blacky. His techniques are not bad, but not great either. It's NOT what Voivod should have sounded like on this album. True Voivodians would be disapointed."
1,did not work,The card did not work. Customer service did not respond. The attenna did help boost the linksys card I ended up installing.
1,over-simplified diatribe,"Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.There is no difference between supply and demand.The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.It is all very simple; listen to me.If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free."
2,GREAT!!!!!!,One of the most fact filled books I have read on the REDHEAD topic.Being a redhead myself I love learing about my strands of copper.
1,Don't bother reading the book,"I was recommended this book by a family member. I'm going to be honest, this book is really bad. The main character is a Mary Sue type character (she can do everything perfectly, tame horses, etc) and it's like a Harliquin romance novel - because there's so much sex in it. This book was a complete waste of time."
2,Rumours DVD,"The Rumours DVD is a retrospective documentary made 21 years after its release. Nothing more and nothing less. It's appeal will primarily benefit those interested in the way the tracks were laid down, the underlying emotions that led to the creation of the individual songs, and hearing bits and pieces of the tracks with the other instruments removed. It's important to remember that no filming occurred in the Record Plant (their recording studio) during the sessions. The film footage that did exist was all post production concert footage; sound quality that is poor by present video based audio standards.With that said, those interested in learning how one of the most emotionally charged albums in Rocks history was created will find the DVD very gratifying. Those looking for film footage of the songs being played in their entirety will be disappointed."
2,EXCELLENT FOR NOVICE OR EXPERT,"For 36 years I have instructed a wide variety of novices, experts and ""so-called"" experts. This book will take you from nothing - to all you really need to know (unless you are into ""one-upsmanship"" or trying to prove something about your masculinity or lack of it). For those (who are using this forum to display their resumes) if you are insecure then you will take your stack of books and your ego and look for anything that might have been left out. You might even list all the books you have, but the truth is, if you are really good at real-life situations, whether actual military combat, law enforcement or the usual combat games, ....all the book-learning in the world is no replacement. This book is well worth what you pay for it, and that's the point of these reviews, not better-than-thou cynicism from would be intellectuals."
1,Doesnt work,"First off I am currently deployed and my wifes fisrt viberator that we bought, to help with the lonely nights, was supposed to be waterproof got some water damage and no longer works. She asked me to order her another so I looked around and found this one, it had many decent reviews so I decided to order it. When it arrived and my wife opened the package only to find that the item I ordered had a much larger cirmcurference, the one she had before was about 5 inches or so. She decided to try to use it because of the fact that there is not a return policy. When she attempted to use the item it did not work, she tried replacing the batteries and that only made the rabbit portion come on. It would be extremely helpful if there were some sizes and lengths to determine what exactly you were buying. So all in all I am extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Bugliosi Brings Out Manson's True Darkness,"Helter Skelter is one of those books that leave you in dismay because you can't believe the logic in the Tate-LaBianca murders. The ""family"" is truely an unbelievable group of people that absolutely butchered for the begining Helter Skelter. I would strongly recomend it to anyone."
2,Good product; annoying bloatware,"I was looking for a capless flash drive so I wouldn't need to keep track of the cap, and the retractable design of this works well. The hardware functions without problems and is even attractive. The case is real metal -- I know because my magnetic bracelet tried to stick to it! (With no harm to either.)Only warning is that the pre-loaded U3 software tries to load itself every time the drive is inserted into a computer -- REALLY annoying when you are trying to use the drive the transfer files to a colleague and it tries to load onto their machine! Even when de-activated, the U3 thing claims a drive name for itself. I thought it would be fun to try the U3 functions but I'm ready to erase the whole thing to get it to stop trying to take over."
2,A RIP-ROARING ADVENTURE!,"I am only about 2/3 through this book, but just have to say it is the most rip-roaring adventure book I have ever read! It is full of information about the early 1800s, the whaling industry, the sea, and about whales that I have never known. It is all fascinating! Although I am a girl (ahem!), I am loving every word of this book, as I also loved THE ENDURANCE and INTO THIN AIR and A FIRST RATE TRAGEDY recently, not to mention TARZAN, FRANKENSTEIN, etc. from years back. This book is highly recommended whether you fancy yourself an adventurer (armchair adventurers okay) or not."
1,Worst book ever,I don't think I've been forced to read a book so poorly written. You would think Smith could put in at least a little plot and maybe a better point. This book is a dull read and not worth the time or money to buy.
1,BROKE IN A MILLION PIECES,I was not able to see if this piece was nice or not. It broke into a million pieces on arrival. You could hear the delivery guy when he was walking to my door. VERY DISAPPOINTED because it was a gift. Returned it right away! Buyer beware!!
2,good value,"if you are a construction guy a straight edge is critical, they are sometimes hard to find at a good price/quality. this one fit the bill and fits [tightly] in my stabilla 8' case with a level."
2,The most amazing book in the world!!!,I would recommend this book to every citizen of this planet. I have read millions of books and this by far is my favorite!! The most amazing!!!
2,Good for the price,"This 4x memory card has 492 pages of memory. The only drawback is that you select the active page with two slide switches. Not bad if you understand binary, but a little hard for 7 year olds."
2,these are the least hideous stockings ever!,"Hi. I ordered a whole selection of stockings from diverse makers, just in case, and these were the classiest as well as the most sheer. They don't cut into your upper thighs, they only have a hint of stick-um at the top, and so you really CAN clip them into garter belts--the whole point!The other stockings were thick, more sweaterish than silkish, and generally unsexy as well as hampered with that big fat band of stay-up rubber at the top. Ick. I plan to go back to this company and get a whole cross-section of colors.Oh, I also ordered one size up from what the size chart recommended for my wieght/size, that way they go higher on the leg than halfway, it's way sexier up nearer the top of your thigh."
2,Works great with my Compaq Presario with Windows Vista sp2,"I tried two linksys wireless cards and they were bad, one barely got a signal and the other one simply didn't detect my router.This one immediately did work after installing the drivers. Granted I've only had it for a week, but am very pleased. Our router is at the bedroom which is in the other end of the house (my desktop is in the bedroom opposite side) and the signal is awesome!!!"
2,"Length makes the ""lightness"" feel heavy","Based faithfully on the book by Milan Kundera, a non-political Lothario doctor in Prague in 1968 comes to grips with two things in his life: his love for one woman and a commitment to the political uprising in his homeland. Because of the latter he is no longer allowed to practice medicine and is forced to live on a farm in poverty. His love for the woman, too, has been put to the test, yet he sticks with her, even though it means returning to his country after being given exile in France.The themes are intelligent and interesting, but the development is too slow: the movie is much too long at nearly 3 hours. Scenes seemed to be dragged out interminably, especially those in Paris as he weighs his conscience regarding his love and his homeland, and near the end on the farm. Because of this the movie as a whole seems to lack focus. But this is compensated for in the story's interest. The sex scenes are very sensual. Worth a watch."
1,Not Happy,As soon as I opened the package I knew something wasn't right because there was sand inside. I put them on later in the day and there was sand on my arm. I finally found the hole in one of the weights. Not happy to say the least.
1,Subscription Flawed?,"Bought the 2005 program in the spring. I've been using this program for about 4 months, now the program prompts me to renew my subcription. I can't manually run a virus scan because the program requests that I renew my subcription. Other programs give you one year of use before renewing. I'm not certain if this product is working correctly. I'm going to use a different product instead."
2,Very Satisfied,I was very pleased with this desk and chair- Was able to assemble it fairly easy and now my daughter is enjoying it very much- The desk is quite sturdy and the chair is strong- The delivery of my product was expedited quickly- Thank you very much
2,Way to go Monti!,"This may be my favorite Blubinos CD yet, I love the acousticness (is that a word?) of it. It is a nice contrast to The Mean Eighteen - another all time favorite of mine and highly recommended also."
2,"STRONG WRITING, PAINFUL HONESTY","Mr. Hartley has given us a book of our times. He is literally on the ground of the World Trade Center after the planes hit and goes into Iraq with the invasion. There is a certain lack of pretension in his style and I feel that the writing and the photos he gives us are as close to the reality of being there without being there.He is not afraid to present himself as a humanist who is in love with the Army, which I am afraid will be far too complex for many who cannot reconcile that idea. His foibles, screw-ups, less than flattering lights are all in there.He says he has not read books of other wars and I believe him. If he did, the style and degree of openess would be very different. Without trying to be poetic or profound, he testifies to the day-to-day grind of trying to make a difference in the occupation of a hostile land.This is as real as it gets."
1,disappointed,HAD A PAIR OF NIKE SHOX THAT THE SOLE HAD SEPARATED SOME. PURCHASED SHOE GOO. APPLIED AND CLAMPED FOR 48HRS. ONCE CLAMP REMOVED SOLE SEPARATED IMMEDIATELY. GOO DOES NOT WORK!!!!!
2,FIVE STAR CD!,I LOVE THIS CD. A VERY REFRESHING AND UNIQUE SOUND FROM THE NEWEST SUPERSTAR IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY!
1,BATMAN ENDS,"Batman Begins is not better than Tim Burtons 1989 epic. One reason is that this movie takes its self to seriously, There is no sence of adveture or fun. Batman begins may have taken what was missing frrom the old movies but he forgot to give us the colors, the fun dialoge and the joy of Batman here we have a scary, dark drama. I perfer the first two"
2,"Over all the book was good, but some parts were slow.","the book had a great story behind it and it was told well for the most part. The only thing i could say that was negative about it was some parts were slow. It was mostly a book for the twelve and older range, but for the most part,it was entertaining."
2,i'll just add my two cents,"i'm sure everyone else is doing the same, but this album is truly a work of genius"
1,Horrible read don't waste your time!!,"This book proves to be unconstitutional, I cannot believe John Yoo teaches at UC Berkeley, I would be ashamed to call myself a professor and a patriot writing a book like this."
1,Wish I could give zero stars,"Avoid this book at all costs. It contains numerous errors, misleading items, and misspellings. In the example problems, many of the answers are worked out to find something other than what the original question asked (i.e. oxidation state instead of coordination number). I suggest the author, Monique Laberge, allow someone else to write the next edition."
1,Big let down,"I expected better from Clay. This CD is just an example of Clay not being Clay. Why change? You have a great broadway, caberet voice Clay. Stop screaming and please step away from the pop music. It just isn't you!"
1,Causes Reboot Delay...,"The system works great and the clarity is perfect. The problem is when I reboot the computer, it takes 10 minutes. I just get a single flashing dot in the top left corner for 10 solid minutes and then it will finally boot up. If I unhook the printer, the system boots up normally... HELP!!!"
2,Great Game,"This game would get 5 *s if it wasn't so...hard! You see, there are 10 goals that need completed in each level, in any order, but they are by no means easy in any way. You can just do the easy ones at first, to get to the first couple boards. But then the goals just get difficult to the point where playing any longer becomes a horror. Plus, you have to start over from the very beginning every time you complete a goal. It is also tough to figure out what the goals actually ARE. They are stated in the form of 4-line ""poems"" that can be accessed at any time by pressing the BACK button.This game is not racy in-and-of itself, but is rated ""T"" because of the extreme plot line. You are a young bat (stay with me) whose parents were killed by a king, so now you vow deadly revenge on the ruler, and I'm guessing that your quest is to kill him and take over as king.It's a fun time, and a recommended title; if you are willing to devote a WHOLE lotta hours on it."
2,Don't skip over any of them!!!,"I often buy Cds. In almost all cases I will skip over a few songs that don't appeal to me. This is the first cd in a very long time that I can actually say I like all of them. Even though this cd is considered all ""pop"" it has a continuity to it that doesn't happen very often. Each track is unique. There is an easy flow within this album,yet you get the feeling that each song is different.I honestly can't tell you which song I like best.....I think that is a matter of personal opinion. For a debut album I feel this one will appeal to many for various reasons. I don't think you will be disappointed ...."
2,Beautiful and tragic,Of Mice and Men is one of those stories that resonates with you long after you finish. On one hand it's a tragedy on the other it's so beautifully written. A good one to read again every once in a while.
2,Like my new shorts,I'm a cotton man through and through. The elastic waist-ban has cotton woven into it and so far is proving to be very comfortable. We will see how well this cotton in the ban holds up through the months of wear and washing(I really don't like nylon touching my skin). Its been about 4-5 weeks and so-far so-good.
1,PAMPERS BABY DRY ARE TERRIBLE!!!,"Don't buy these!!! I have always used Pampers diapers, and think they are far superior to other brands. Until, that is, I tried these Baby Dry diapers! They leaked like crazy! Not onece or twice, but every time I used them! If I didn't change the baby IMMEDIATELY after them getting wet, it would soak straight through the diaper and wet her clothes! NEVER had a problem like that with the Cruisers...I still have an almost full package of Baby Dry because I got sick of changing clothes constantly from the leaks! I will never buy these again-- only Pampers Cruisers from now on!!!"
2,"If you want action, dont read this","If you want a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat with action and plot twists, then read a comic book. This is one of the slowest books I have ever read. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is truely chilling, how close this book mimics reality. Free speach may not be outlawed here, but when the news media is outraged at someone who is prolife.. or when a TV show has to have either sex, violence, or very rude humor to get good ratings.. or when the most improtant thing on the new is the presidents love life.. it really makes you think about just how close we are to the world F451. Many people hate this book because it is so boring, but i think it is good because it doesnt rely on speedy action or witty catch phrases."
1,It's a shame there are not 0 stars on ratings,Reasons not to buy this video:1. She reads from cue cards the entire time.2. She's extremely stiff and boring.I have only watched this video once in the two years that I have owned it.
2,This CD is the greatest!!,I waited so long for this CD and it was so worth the wait!!! His voice is so soulful. I love it!! This CD is so great and his voice makes every woman's heart melt. He is the American Idol winner!! His voice The songs Great! Great! Great! Buy! Buy! Buy! It is worth every penny. Thanks Clay for having the voice and the talent for making me excited about music again!!! I can't wait for CD #2 and your tour.
1,Turn the stove up to 451 degrees and throw this book in!,"Okay,first off I would like to say that I enjoy almost any book I read. This book has made it to the top of my ""burn this book"" list. Dont get me wrong, the idea was well thought up, but the book wasn't well written. First off, the book starts off with someone trying to commit suicide,and this character is saved even though she's totally wack. Second, the main character is named ""GUY MONTAG"". How origanal. Third, the people in this book are IDIOTS! I mean, first they outlaw all ""offensive"" material, then they condense great novels into two page stories,and then they sit around on thier butt all day watching the ""family"" argue and OFFEND each other. The best character in the book simply dissappears in the middle of the book, and then she is found dead. Not only that but no one has friends. Not even your spouse is your friend. What kind of wack society doesn't have friends. This book needs to be re-written, and seriously re-done"
2,Hardly like the games but still good,I thought this was a great film. I admit it's different from the games. I wasn't born when the movie came out but I rented it. The film is a little weird at times. Like that evolution thing. The special effects are convincing enough. There's something I don't get. The film was relaesed in 1993. That's the same year jurassic park was released and it used cgi. So was this film made before CGI or what? If it did use cgi that would have been great! The idea of changing Bowser from a fire breathing monster into a human is silly. The film would have looked better if it was animated like the tv series so the can animate the enimies which would be easier. Too bad there isn't a sequel. It would have been nice.
1,Real Bad Book,I've read it over and over and I can't understand anything. Struts Html Tags are glossed over without examples. Just 2 lines on how to use the tags but the object/bean that it refers to is left to your imagination. If you understand the javadoc that comes with Struts then this will be clear to you but then you don't need a book. The O'reilly book is 1000 times better.Serves me right for buying a book without browsing and just relying on the reviews.
2,Give this book to a your children.,"Economics in One Lesson elucidates the basic principles of Economics in a simple, understandable language. If you are just starting out on economics, I would recommend this as your first book. College Textbooks will bore you and treatise like Human Action by L.W. Mises are pretty hard for a beginner.Also, be sure to give this book to your children. Schools don't teach economics, a most important of subjects.With that said, I would like to comment on many 1 star reviews. Notice how they don't comment on the content of the book. Economics is a Science, and it is better to put away your Political Glasses when studying it."
2,Understanding,This book helped me under the Holy Spirt in my life. It gave me a better understanding of what he is and how he works in my life.
2,Lots of fun for Dear Abbey lovers,This book was great! Lots of old Dear Abbey letters with background information on the thoughts that were behind the answers.
1,Falls far short of expectations.,"The author in the preface says that he expects this book to be a complete reference for Tomcat. I would say that it falls far short of the objective.I had expected a meaningful look at Tomcat. Most of the information presented is already available with the standard Tomcat distribution. There is no attempt to go beyond the surface. It seems the author was in a rush to get a book published, rather than spend time providing some insight into Tomcat.There is no proper introduction to the terms or concepts related to Tomcat. I don't expect an introduction to servlets or JSP. All I ask for is clear concise definitions of the various Tomcat components and a breakdown of the config files.If you are intrested in finding more about Tomcat stick to looking for the information online. It will be time well spent."
1,Wait for the better version,"Bose is supposed to have a good reputation in innovative audio technology. But, this attempt at ""Acoustic Noise Cancelling"" is a misnomer, in fact, plain misleading. It may reduce some engine noise in the plane, but you hear everything else, including screaming chidren and chatty passengers. The idea is good, but the technology is nowhere there. I'm returning mine back."
1,Simply bad music,"Clay Aiken has talent does he? I've got an idea... maybe he could put his talent to good use and make real, interesting music. Sounds good to me; I don't know about you. Oh well, just another failure in popular music today. I guess there's nothing to be done."
1,Not what you think it is. It's terrible.,"If you've recently been to Hawaii and you are looking for the music by 10 feet, this is NOT the band. This one is horrible and it only has three terrible songs on it. Not recommended."
1,"Poor writing, decorated with bad grammar",I got the impression that this author has actually read very few pieces of literature. He certainly should not be writing a book that anyone else may accidentally read. It's really that bad!
2,Just Like New,Saved alot of money. Looks brand spank'n new and works like a charm.I have purchased two other remanufactured cusinart products from Amazon and they were also about 70% less than retail and they both were like brand new.
2,Current fans not disappointed,"While you won't find here anything that stretches the boundaries of what you know to be Swearing at Motorists, those of us who dig their previous works will find more to enjoy. The mellow delivery of obtuse and biting lyrics are in play. The ""round"" vocal sound. The sweet, warm guitar tone. All here.The one fun departure is the punkinsh ""Paul Williams"". This ode to the vertically challenged actor may not be long overdue, but it will turn that frown upside down."
2,Classic Memories Abound,"This is a fun movie for anyone, but especially for the kids. Let them watch this movie and be amazed how excited they are to watch the adventure of Mario and Luigi over and over again. It works as a kids' movie, but even as an adult or parent you'll find things to enjoy. Give it a chance. You won't be disappointed."
2,Caught the fever!,"I was introduced to this band by some friends. Not only are their covers better than some of the original recordings but Brian's love songs are amazing. Give a listen this cd, specifically I'm Gonna Stay and the title track, The Great Symphony."
2,Not the same as pitchure,The book dose the job as far as that goes and it is a used book but I was expecting a newer book going by the pitchure
2,Robot Fixer,"""Robot Stories"" is a movie that includes within it, 4 stories; all having to do with a robot or some such A.I. technology. Each story focuses on a particular time period in life, beginning from birth and ending in death. The second story deals only with toy robots, but it's the most moving. It deals with a mother comming to accept the loss of her comatose son. Clay, the last story, was also very insightful and interesting. The old sculptor of the story struggles with his obligation to ""scan"" his brain for the sake of future generations having access to his knowledge or the dignity of a natural death.This is the kind of science fiction that I love and hope to see more of. It's sci-fi that works to bring out the humane, using it to contrast and make the human experience ""pop"" to dramatize it to the limit without becoming contrived. ""Robot Stories"" is a wonderful collection of stories spanning a life of experiences."
1,"Love Eucerin, but this one dried white and sticky","I tested this product on my arms for a week. It dried sticky, and this caused me to be very itchy. I ended up stratching up my arms, but after I stopped using this product, my arms started to clear back up. But, still have some scarring. I think I will go back to the original Eucerin that dried clear, and didn't leave any residue."
1,Not satisfied.,"We purchased this microwave in October for $300 minus the $50 rebate. Panasonic denied our first rebate submission, claiming we'd bought the wrong item. A phone call cleared up the misunderstanding and apparently our rebate is on its way. However, I've since been told that rebate problems and denials are a common occurrence with Panasonic.The microwave has a nice appearance and functions well. However, there is a significant design flaw. You cannot use the hood light as a nightlight or even keep it on for very long without heating up the inside of the microwave to the point where the internal fan comes on and the microwave will not turn on to cook. After the oven cools down, it seems to function normally. The first time this happened, the inside of the oven was so hot I thought it was a short circuit. For that reason, I do not recommend buying this appliance. I wonder if this is why the price has dropped dramatically..."
1,Buy the box set instead of this!,All it is the summary of the boxset i guess for the budget nirvana fan? the reason i am giving it 2 stars all it had to offer was a track not included in the box set which is the come as you are demo.. the box set is alot more expensive but has alot more to offer than this and you get a decent dvd to watch all in all a buy for the hardcore nirvana fan... also the art work was originally picked out by Frances Bean Cobain and thats a good thing! other than that buy the box set
1,a novelty,"If you are looking for a 'toy' that lights up and kinda plays music, then this is the product for you. Looking back at my purchase of IZ-it just seems like a waste of money."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read....,"I read the first two chapters of this book, and I have to say that the writing was horrible. I can't believe that I wasted my time reading that much of the book."
2,Solid Product.,This seems to work for us. When he was nursing at night we still needed 2 diapers to get through the night. At this point with 1-0 night nursings 1 diaper generally does the trick.
2,mega FUN for all,This product is awesome. Children as well as adult children can safely play with product and not damage it at all. If you have a very playful child (or adult) this is the best toy to have.
2,Liked,I liked this book. The characters are very enjoyable and the plot was interesting. It was a little predictable though...
2,fitness,It's very simple and straight to the point and it helps out. Gives you straight motivation and a relastic out look.
1,"Hun, Clay is sooooo lame","Hun, the CD is nothing special. It is not an essential CD like the Beatles, Supremes, or Aretha. He will be a one CD hit wonder huns."
2,This is an amazing book.,"This book was required summer reading 2 years ago for my english II AP class. I thought it was really an amazing book. I loved the main character how strong willed she was even though she was more human and not cave man. I thought Auel did a great job writing it, but sometimes she was too descriptive about setting of the story. Description and imagery is good, but too much of it takes away from the story. I have read the rest of the series, but if you like this book you should read the others that go along with this series.thank you for your time,Loran"
1,rip off,no place in the ad does it say the use of this depends on the radio stations in your area must belong to their service for this to work none in my area of south west florida seem to least of all my favorite stations and it seems that the music you listen too must be of the lastest out or there is no info on it or where you can buy it so yes i feel like i got ripped off ... thank you sony
2,Dear Mad'm,"I first purchased this book while on a vacation trip exactly 14 years ago (1989); since then I've tried to read it at least once a year. I laugh my way through the book, and the author's courage & zest for life continues to inspire me! I only hope I am able to always view life with the same gusto & joy she had, trials & tribulations notwithstanding. She was quite a remarkable woman."
2,Very Very Pleased!,"Was hesitant to purchase because of the price. I was not expecting such quality for the price. I am very very pleased with the fit. It came with a matching shawl and satin straps that I can attach to the dress myself, which I thought was nice because I don't really feel comfortable wearing strapless dresses. I actually ordered two other styles of dresses from this company when I purchased this one to make sure I had a dress suitable to wear for my occasion. I was pleasantly pleased with all of them. They all fit well. I purchased Mediums (my measurements are 34-29-41, pear-shaped) and this dress flatters my figure. I will be purchasing others. I found that the dresses fit according to the sizing chart that is one of the pictures shown."
2,Intex Airbed,"These are only meant for use as temporary or guest bedding, but I've been in a situation where I am using this item daily as my bed for over a month now. I am a large person. It has held up beautifully. I add air maybe once every 7-10 days. The flocked top is great, holding sheets in place. It is so comfortable, my back and general body pain has improved dramatically since using it! I suspect that when my permanent bed arrives, this little bed will serve long and well as guest bedding."
2,War,I think that stories like this happenes in the time of War .The only think is that we did not enjoy this moivie is thatyou can tell that Penn is acting especially during that rapescene where his face get all blushed . Michael on the otherhand I think that was great . But with that title De Palma couldhave invented a much better movie . But in the end I think thatits great and that one should give it a try
2,Stunning,"This tiny Steinbeck classic, published in 1937, is still considered one of the most stunning, impact producing works ever written. It continues to knock my socks off. And more than likely, always will. If you've never had the pleasure of reading this timeless classic, you really, really should."
2,State of Play,"These Miniseries are excellent, if you like sophisticated scripts, good acting, intelligent ambiance, this is for you. No one can beat the British on this genre."
1,leaves streaks - do not cover effectively,I am disappointed with this product.It is very cakey and do not cover blemishes more then my regular make up.It leaves streaks which looks really unattractive.I also find it hard to apply.
1,"Not the ""greatest"" in my book.","Sure, this generation won a war, but what was the alternative?In my opinion, all this generation did was run up the world's greatest debt...then leave it to their kids to pay the tab.When they didn't have a war to send their children to, they created one in Vietnam. After killing over 50,000 of us, they decided maybe it wasn't such a good idea afterall.When they decided they didn't want to pay for their own medical bills, they created Medicare. And guess who pays? They underfunded their retirement. And guess who pays? They built a highway system. And guess who pays? They poluted the environment like never before. Guess who pays to clean it up the mess.I do agree with Brokaw on one point, this is one generation that was the greatest at one thing...avoiding responsibility."
2,GOOD LOOKIN'!!,"My girlfriend told me I had to see this movie, that I would love the ""eye candy"". She was right; I could spend much more time watching these girls dance around. But in addition to all that, it ends up being a very entertaining movie - fun characters, fun story, fun music."
1,"Predictable, cliched, mediocre acting....","Having been excited at the prospect of a gripping, historically accurate, realistic WWI film about the ""Lafayette Escadrille,"" Flyboys is a big letdown. Devoid of historical substance, second-rate acting, predictable storyline - it shouldn't come as a big surprise that this movie was a flop at the theaters.Briefly, the CGI dogfights border on the ridiculous: aircraft in 1916 were hardly capable of the acrobatics and stunts shown throughout the film. More reminiscent of Star Wars than actual flying.Also: the portrayal of the Germans is laughable....all German pilots flying bright red, Red Baron-style, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, and led by the sinister ""Black Falcon."" (!) Come on!Recommended: ""The Blue Max"""
2,Fun but short lived,"I think this is best for 1-3 year olds. I have three boys ages 2, 4 & 5 and I thought they would enjoy it more than they do.Instead of playing with it like the game it's intended, they like to put cars in the croc's mouth! Which is fine. This is a good toy for car trips or plane rides because it's small, lightweight and quiet!"
2,A true classic!,"Orwell does a fantastic job of showing the negative effects of a utopia. He shows how ""the party"" can take over everything. They can control you, and everyone can be the same. The individual person no longer exists. His realisism portrays true possibilities of what might occur. 2 thumbs up ! Go Lakers!"
2,nice rice maker,The Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker is relatively simple to operate. I prefer brown rice so that's mainly why I fire up the cooker (though white rice is good as long as nothing is mixed in with it). The only bad thing about the cooker is that it's WAY too expensive to buy online. Try to look for one at your local department store. If they don't have one your best option would be to see if your local department store allows you to specially order a rice maker from them. Do NOT order one from somewhere online.
1,Surface Noise!!!!!!,"Guys, where are the master tapes? This transfer was taken direct from vinyl. Ze is charging premium prices for this and you can hear surface noise throughout this cd. This wasn't even taken from a particularly clean copy of the vinyl!!!!!"
2,HOw to Stop a Stalker,"I read this book in conjunction with my women's studies classes and found the information to be very enlightening. It is a very readable book, and provided invaluable information regarding a little known- but growing- problem for college women. I highly recommed this text."
1,very simple interpretation of bellydance,"I take group bellydance classes and have been to seminars and workshops. This is bellydance but only the very simplest form. Atea is ok and this is a good tape to start with if you are not sure how serious you are about learning. It introduces you to things like veil and zills but it does not instruct you on them. If you are sure you want to dance you should shop around spend just a little more money getting a tape from someone/troup that dances a style you are interested in and has a well known face and name. For example Fat Chance Bellydance for American Tribal style or Aisha Ali for African dance or someone well known for Egyptian or Turkish Caberet. If this is a serious investment for you-get a good tape, beginner or otherwise if you search around you will find several."
2,cuts to the heart,"It seems the earned province of Canadian women writers to cut to the heart of gender, race, and class privilege. In the title piece (I would not call it a story in the traditional character/plot sense) Schoemperlen explores a series of intangibles, among them faith, prayer, and hope, and very subtly weaves them into an indictment of middle class privilege. In a later story, ""Count Your Blessings (a Fairy Tale)"" Schoemperlen, in a twist reminiscent of the best Roald Dahl stories, cuts the heart out of the woman who has everything and is still unhappy. These stories are well-written, and are accompanied by clever old woodcut clip art. But unlike many short story collections, this is not an ""easy"" book, for the reader, and I suspect, for the author as well. The book jacket describes her work as ""electric""--the prospective reader would do well to remember that electricity can shock as well as enlighten."
1,I DON'T AGREE,"I bought both your book as well as Mental Models AS PER YOUR RECOMMENDATION AND REGRETTED THAT MORE.Yours is information vaguely spread along 560 pages and Indi's book is totally abstract, which I am still trying to understand. I would have appreciated if you could have cut all the fluff in 60 pages instead.GOD KNOWS how do you guys get all the five stars FROM"
1,Bad ink?,"Item arrived with black powdery smudges on the cover and edge of paper. I don't know if it's from the laser ink powder of the packing slip, or if it's from the printing on the cover. It is acceptable but messy. Also, the photo clearly shows a set of 2 books, but there's only one as detailed in the description."
2,A great replacement for my office chair,"I work in software so I often sit at a computer for long periods of time which has caused me some back issues. I've traded my office chair for this exercise ball. It is a great size and feels very sturdy. I don't imagine I could pop it unless I really tried. I didn't watch the included DVD as I'm not using this ball for exercise so I can't say if the DVD content is any good or not. The hand pump works fine, although it does take a little while to inflate the ball. Once inflated it holds air well. If you need a decent exercise ball for exercise or just sitting on this is a good one."
1,OMG!!!,One of the top 10 worst books ever. Waded through 100 pages and decided life is way too short to waste it reading this gibberish. AVOID!!!!!
1,Eye cream,The seal was broken and some of the product had been used. Because I was afraid to use it I tossed it out.
2,Warms the heart.,"I am not American. Nor do I usually buy this kind of music. I heard a few tracks by accident in a music store. But... we live in dark times, someone singing about friendship and brotherhood makes me feel that there are some good people out there. Its simple messages warm the heart. If the heart is true, the music is beautiful no matter whether the music is rock, rap... or in this case American Folk Music."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"First of all you have to already have a pretty stiff erection to get this thing on. Secondly, we've used it twice and the third time we went to use it one of the dolphin heads split apart from the main ring. We've washed it both times we used it with toy cleaner - nothing harsh. It's cheaply made and the batteries do not last at all. Once it was on it really didn't do what it is supposed to do - it's more awkward than anything. Definitely would not recommend."
1,Not the book from your childhood.,Stephen Gammell's amazing and terrifying art --the most memorable part of this series-- has been stripped and replaced with generic art by Brett Helquist in this edition.
2,Handy and accurate,"I find this book most useful for the 12 star maps found at the very begining. It gives basic information about astronomy in a comprehensible manner. The book is handy enough to keep with you and with a small penlight you can reference the maps while observing the night sky, easily fits in a jacket or pans back pocket. Additionally I found the mythology behind the traditional western culture naming of the constellations interesting.Only criticisms include 1) as previously mentioned, no star charts for the Southern Hemisphere and 2) wasted pages printing illustrations of the characters the constellations represent. These pages could have been used to add Southern Hemisphere maps or to discuss more then the listed 13 constellations."
2,The Greatest Play on Earth!,"I was required to read this play for my ninth grade honors English class. I was expecting it to be a good read, but I found it to be an excellent read! Shakespeare is a true genius. His witty puns and his enthralling details kept me grabbing onto every word. I am a true romantic at heart, and this was a very touching play. The character development and the ironic plot twists are also a very nice touch. If you have never read Shakespeare before, read this and you will be hooked on him forever."
1,A Not So Nice Song From A Not So Nice Spice,"Will the real Melanie C please stand up? From athletic, hyper, popster, to cursing, loud, rock chick. Personally I find the new Melanie C to be annoying and way over the top. Not only is this song poorly written, but it's poorly sung, poorly orchestrated, and just poor overall. C'mon now Melanie dont you think you could do a little better than this?"
2,coming of age book,"I read this book almost 30 years ago in 5th grade. I remember having trouble getting what was going on at first. When I finished it the story stuck to me and I kept the book for the longest time. I think I may actually have a copy in my childhood trunk along with all my yearbooks. For some reason, I looked it up randomly today and I was amazed to find out the author wrote the original in 1959 and that it has been re-released several times and includes a digital copy. Way to go Elizabeth; Your work lives on!I can see how the youngsters would consider it boring. It's not the easiest book to read and it is set so far back in time. However, I would still recommend it to any youngster or adult looking for a good coming of age book. I hope I have that copy somewhere..."
2,tobacco pouch,"The material and workmanship is excellent, the ""plastic"" zipper pulls aren't good.They broke the first time used and I replaced them with metal ones. Could use a better quality for these, otherwise very useful product."
2,Excellent insight,"As a long-time Christian, I had to admit that my disciplines were somewhat haphazard. This book is not advocating legalism but encourages discipline while offering insight as to why it is important in order to live a rewarding God-pleasing Christian life. Put into practice, it will cause you to constructively strengthen your Christian walk."
2,Good entertainment.,Amazon service and playback works great. The show I like but I have a soft spot for period pieces. The story lines are predictable but in a good way.
1,Challenging,"This unit is quite difficult to use. The button is very sensitive, which sometimes causes false entries. The website is complicated to use. I think with a little work E-marker will be a good product to have."
2,Blows Toxic Avenger I away,"For those of you who liked TA 1, you've got to get this one. If you thought the first one was funny, then this one is gonna have you rolling on the floor. Imagine the King of Porn, Ron Jeremy, playing a priest--well, he does in this one. That irony is funny enough, but there are are TONS of other funny sh*t in this flick. This movie is non-stop from the get-go. If you like all the Troma goodies--gore, outrageousness, gratuitous nudity, a little bit of lesbo action, and over-the-top comedy--then this movie is a MUST for your collection. You don't just have to be a Troma fan to like this movie. Like I said, if you like all of the things listed above, then you should get this flick. Trust me, you won't be sorry. Just don't watch it with your grandmother or little ones."
1,He can't even make macaroni and cheese,"Wouldn't it have been nice if the _not_ Kurt had gone with Kim Gordon? He could've been a member of the family. How cool would that be to have Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore as parents? Kurt could have sat on the floor surrounded by kittens,making drawings of sperm and embryos with crayons.this over indulgent pile might as well have been about nothing at all, instead ol' Gus decided to cash in on Kurts name. the real question is, why not? everyone else did."
2,Not bad...,"Since I drive a hatchback ('04 Pontiac Vibe) with room for a couple of bikes in the back, I don't have a ton of experience with bike racks. I recently moved 300 miles to another state, and I needed that space for boxes of stuff. I considered buying a roof-mount system, but the minimal amount of use didn't justify the rather high buy-in price for such systems. A relative loaned me a used (not sure what brand/model) rear-mount rack, but I was pretty apprehensive about the low quality and instability of the loaner rack. I picked the Saris for its blend of affordability and stability, and I was not disappointed. It weathered 260+ miles of interstate and a good chunk of bumpy city roads without any problems. I loaded a heavier, steel-framed Surly Cross Check nearest the vehicle and a lighter, aluminum & carbon Trek road bike on the outside."
2,Camera Battery Charger,I have used this product in the past with great success. I ordered more because I had misplaced my original one.
1,Very poor,"I'm a HUGE Jet Li fan. I love great kung fu movies. This is not one. There is NO kung fu at all. The rest is a surreal dream that includes a guy chained to a boulder and a guy that gets stabbed and asks why he was assassinated. It may be worth a laugh, but that's a stretch."
2,Practical and Informative,"This book is practical, instructive and easy to read. The author tackles important issues related to safety in these difficult times. There are chapters on traveling domestically and internationally for business and pleasure as well as a chapter on how to protect yourself and your family. It also contains a comprehensive reference section. This book is for anyone who needs to know about terrorist threats and how to respond to those threats."
2,The way singles should be...,"All four of the b-sides on this album could've appeared on ""The Man Who."" I actually like a couple of them more than the single ""Writing to Reach You.""""Green Behind the Ears"" is a good pulsating rocker that also makes a good singalong song. ""Only Molly Knows"" (which wasn't a hidden track on my copy of ""The Man Who"") is a brillant acoustic endeavor that follows a unique song structure of repeating the name ""Molly"" twice in each verse. ""Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah"" sounds like a Beatles outtake, with Fran taking on the role of a ""Helter Skelter""-esque Paul McCartney. Another great track. The last track, ""High as a Kite,"" is also exceptional in its call-and-response chorus.Believe me, even if you just own ""The Man Who,"" if you ever come across this single, get it! A great single and four excellent b-sides! What more could you ask for?"
2,Enduring saga....,"So I purchased this book for my about to be 80-year old father, who did his tour of duty in Normandy, and elsewhere. It's this veteran's opinion that will count -- but I kept wishing that the book had been written and had the voice of Walter Cronkite whose chronicles of WWII were an indelible memory and part of my childhood. I bet even Tom Brokaw would nod ""yes"" in agreement to that...."
2,a real history book,"A book where every name ,situation,person is based in facts and books.A book where author knows his sources and have a clear view of achivments and drawbacks of Soviet space programmAn author who can read Ruusian and have of net contact of the sourcesI found the style of language difficult but fluid."
2,Best of the series,"A first rate beautifull compilation, with every selection a winner. One of my personal favorties. Great music and great soundinf too. Ella's ""Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most"" was for me, a revelation. All artists best work."
1,"Extremely repetitive, needed a haircut","I mean, 2.5 hours? Really? The story line is so simple, this could easily have been a taut 90 mins and we all would have been a lot happier. I actually have not seen the first two in this series, so this only starts to make some limited sense after a long while. Anyone should be able to watch, though, and get it, thus the editing here needed more work. The absurdly plumped up lips of the girlfriend continuously transfixed me, way more than the silly transformer action fight sequences. Speaking of which, that is where all the fat is here. The fighting could have been seriously cut and no one would have complained except maybe the kids who made this comic book movie. Is anyone surprised to learn that the bad guys/good guys theme ends with the good guys in charge, yet again?"
2,"""Never Mind that the Water Is Poisoned!""","Well written, and realistic. Thomas is a well-meaning but rather tactless environmentalist. His brother Peter is more concerned about Thomas making a fool out of himself than trying to fix the situation. Just like in real life, there are no easy solutions but there are plenty of alibis and irrational negotiations from politicians (""If you'll just take back what you said...""). The only friend Thomas really has is the reader."
1,"the movie rocks, BUT...","... sometimes it's nice to see that, indeed sometimes we germans clearly get better editions of some movies than you americans do. and in this case, the german company E-M-S did a very cool 2-disc Special Edition of Perdita Durango (original title) with the original english soundtrack. so I'd recommend this edition to all you americans with region-free-players, 'cause THIS FILM ROCKS UNCUT!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Love Tobias Wolff!,"A very short read, but full of emotion and great story. David Sedaris also highly recommends this read. Try it. you'll like it!"
2,converse all stars,Quick delivery and item was just as described. These are pretty hard to find so I was very happy to get these for my husband
2,I like Tp2..,"This Cd is 2nd only to Twelve Play! I love it. I remember hearing it back in 2001. It was then and still is hot. I only deducted one star because a few songs on Cd were scratched. My Cd player had been cleaned with a laser disc cleaner beforehand, I did not mishandle the Cd. I even cleaned it... Yes scratched ...so that kinda sucks, but Tp2 is still a great Cd , and the fact that Cd was scratched on a few songs is no fault of R Kelly! I'm still happy I purchased it for my collection... I may have to repurchase in future so that I can enjoy every single song, but still enjoyed most songs!"
2,Definitely Brief,"I do like the book and use it alot for school. The part that I use most is the Directory of Words Cited. Unfortunately, many times the exact type of work to be cited is not listed. For instance, a book with an editor in multiple volumes in an edition other than the first is not covered. Neither is an article from a journal obtained from a database."
2,Seek no further if you love melancholy music!,"This is it. The best, most heartfelt debut I've heard in a long, long while. Lhasa sings of love, rejection, defiance, vanity, birds in the desert, the fish in the river, the tree of forgetfulness, all with a voice that is now sweet as desire, now wrenching as a lover's scorn. The music reminds me alternately of fado, klezmer, cabaret and Kurt Weill. And the girl is only 25. One can only wait with bated breath and hope it won't be too long before the second album appears. Meanwhile, I'll try not to wear out this CD!"
1,Major let down!,"I bought this product based on the positive reviews. I wish I hadn't bought this waist cincher. The bottom of the cincher ends in a weird triangle, which goes about 4 inches on my thigh, the bottom wrinkles up and looks ugly, it is extremely visible under a normal t-shirt, and it looks TERRIBLE if you sit down while wearing it. This looks decent (barely) when you're standing up, and you might as not wear it if you ever need to sit down. The length is way off, it goes 4 inches down to my thigh and up to an inch from my armpits. I'm 5'3 and weight 125 lbs. This looks terrible and I'm sending it back the same day it was delivered. Save your money."
1,Not pleased with Express delivery!,"My review is not about the book. This is one of my textbooks I needed for my course and I was glad that Amazon had it in stock. However I chose to pay highest shiping amount to express delivery for next day, (which happens to be Saturday) so that I have time to review chapter before school started, it did not arrive that Saturday. What is purpose was next day delivery if you don't receive the product on time? I think I paid about $25 for one book when there was an option to receive Monday delivery for much less ($10, I think). The book arrived on Monday after my school started and I did not have a book to take to school. Amazon owes me money!"
2,GOOd,"a gift for my friend he loved it is a child movie and could find it anywhere but here, great price and fast shipping"
1,The most violent generation,"Here is a book that was hailed as a best seller before it was even released. One that was fed to the public by one of America's leading talking heads, Tom Brokaw. My grandfather was at Normandy and later helped liberate several concentration camps throughout Germany. What these experiences cost him, was ultimately his life. He rarely smiled after witnessing the horrific brutality, and inhumanity that was set loose on the world in WWII and after. This book is an attempt to rewrite, an already severely inaccurate history of this period of time. Brokaw tries to take the attention from the mass slaughter that was perpetrated by BOTH sides, and instead focus on the heartwarming yet tragic human interest stories so common to todays evening news. Living through the ""greatest generation"", killed my grandfather's spirit, along with millions of others like him, who instead saw in it a living hell, and a disgrace to humanity."
1,Total Piece of Cr*p,"Worst novel I've read in a long time, and I'm tolerant on sci-fi. No wonder it was rejected for years by editors and then, oh dear, downloaded by people by who have not read much when the author self-published it.This book is a piece of cr*p, with characters who mostly hate one another, and then most of them die. Much of story is these idiots who hang around a building, yelling at one another, then die. So you get to know a few characters, and then they're dead in a few pages.Gawd. There was not one single character I liked. I actually hoped they would all get keeled and recuse me from this poor excuse of a story."
2,The Dark Prince Returns.,"This was everything that I wanted in a Batman movie. Great acting, action, characters and plot. Best Batman movie yet in my opinion.I saw this movie first in Galway and thought it was really good, but when I saw it a second time in Paris I found it much better than the first time. Emotional score, dramatic acting and dark to the core. Brilliant."
1,Poop leaks out the back,As soon as I got these diapers I was surprised at how light and thin they were and I was also worried about the absorbent pad not running all the way to the back. The next day my fears were realized and I got poop all over my shorts. It leaked right out the back. These diapers have a cheap look to them and they perform that way too. I still have about 240 of these left so it will be a long month! My wife thought it was pretty funny though.
2,"Good fun, as usual","A really fun book, well worth your time if you like Pratchett. None of our old pals [Rincewind, Gaspode, Vimes, Susan] put in an appearence [other than the guy WHO TALKS LIKE THIS and an old monk with a broom, and they but briefly], but it does add some info to the overall Discworld mythology, and provides some laughs as well."
2,pocket neopet handheld rocks,Neopethandheld is great. It is a toy to take care of.I got mine at my tenth birthday.And I know it shold have a five star.A Great handheld toy. take care of your tonu . also raise and take care of tonu!!!!!!!!:)::)
2,People get ready,Eva Cassidy. What can one say. She was a shining star whose voice was a fine instrument. Her loss to music slowed the earth. This is an outstanding collection.
1,"""I Wish"".....I never bought this album","This is a very disappointing release. I'm sure R. Kelly worked hard on this release, but the lack of content of the songs written on this album is disturbing. The production, while clear, is uninspiring. ""I Wish"" is the only gem on this album.This effort is reminisent of the 1994 album 12 Play. However, 12 Play (94') release is loaded with heavy bass and catchy tunes. TP-2.com is an album for the ""fans"". Unfortunately, fans are willing to accept anything these day. After the 1998 release ""R"", Kelly showed everyone that he is a skilled songwritter and producer. TP-2.com leaves you with one question, what happened between to Kelly?"
2,25 years later...,"Francie taught me about America, immigration, poverty, and how hard it is to be an intelligent woman.My mom let me check this book out from the public library in 1976 -- I was 8 years old. I've read it countless times over the yaars, and it shaped my career choice... I'm a History Professor, and yes, I assign this book!"
2,A Running Movie,"Although it is in german when you have the DVD you can change languages to english. The base of the story is Lola's boyfriend must get a whole lot of money in 20 minutes. HOW??? well thats the whole plot.It starts out with this wild cartoon and then turns into the ""real life"" which it is the most of the movie. The movie is a non-stop whirl-win of fun. The excitment and action (not explosives) is great.I own this movie and although i dont watch it all the time I do find myself going back and watching it whenever i want to see a good action/excitement movie. It has a good plot and the way the movie was put together is new and vibrant. The music supports the film very well also.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to talk about doing stuff but doesnt because then you can dream you are Lola on this journey but you never really would be!"
1,A dreadful play.,"""The Cherry Orchard"" is an atrocious play. If we hold this play in high regard, then we dramatist's need to reevaluate our standards. Chekhov wrote a play that will make you not care an inch about the character's or their situation(s). For him to think that this is a comedy makes you wonder if he understood the point he himself was trying to make. The characters are pathetic and they'll make you pity them - not because of their predicaments, but because of whom they are. I do not recommend."
1,One star or Five,"I'm torn between giving this book one star for making me depressed and giving the book five stars for how well written and how honest the book is. All in all, the book deserves the classic status it has attained, but do to how the story made me feel, I had to throw my copy away. I am not a reader that will say a simple ""this book sucks"" but this book made me feel bad. The truth behind the tale disturbed me. That was probably the point trying to be made, but even so, I cannot get by how it made me view the world at the end."
2,good all the way thru,Genuinly creepy and disturbing. Good special effects make the a claustrophobics nightmare. The second one follows suit. Worth your time
1,Not made for my baby's sensitive bottom!,"I decided to make the change to pampers based on all the positive reviews from customers. It was a bad decision for my baby! It gave my poor baby a really bad diaper rash from the chemical in the baby dry! Maybe good diapers for others, but definitely not for my baby. I will be sticking with Huggies!"
1,I wish there was a no star rating!,These are awful! They gave our son an angry red raw rash all around his pelvic area! We even took him to the doctor thinking it may have been some time of Thrush from antibiotics! Do not purchase these if your child has sensitive skin or may be allergic to the filler!
2,Nice color,"I looked far and wide for a medium to light brown eyeliner pencil and this one turned out to be perfect. If you have blonde hair, you can look a little trashy wearing black eyeliner, so this is a wonderful find."
2,Great movie!,Under the Tuscan Sun was such an enjoyable movie.Diane Lane is just great in the starring role.
2,Good DVD,"Enjoyed it immensely. The sound is best in stereo. The DTS and 5.1 mix are both done poorly imo. But, the stereo sound is very good!"
2,Read this book!,"I really can't give this novel any less than five stars. I read it every year and find something new, something often horrifyingly accurate in whatever political climate you're in. READ IT!"
1,Poorly Written,The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor's deadline. There was no character development. Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense. I've never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again.
1,Warning for other buyers,"I bought this ring just for ring size testing, so the quality is not a problem for me. But there are something about this ring and it's center stone that i think i should let other buyers know in advance. I highly doubt the material is CZ(Cubic Zirconia). Through carefully observing under the x30 jewelers scope, the refractive index of the center stone seems to be very low, about 1.6, which is very close to glass but not CZ. Typically, a CZ has a refractive index around 2.15. And diamond is 2.4. For those who does not know what i was talking about, let's put it this way: The center stone does not sparkle at all and it looks cloudy...I guess i wont return it since it is very cheap..."
2,Pampers Baby Dry,Really like this product and love the price. My daughter is expecting her first and am getting ready for the new baby. Love it!!
2,Fun low impact workout,"This is a great tape for anyone looking for a low-impact all aerobic workout. All the routines are done to the inspiring oldies but goodies music. It took me 4 - 5 times to get all the routines down. In typical Donna style, she is always inspiring and upbeat. She obviously enjoys what she does and it shows.This tape should be part of your basic collection."
1,McCartney Lovers Only,"I buy/view/listen to a lot of music video's (read, sorry night life) and this one was a disappointment. Sound varies too widely act to act. Couple of goosebump moments (I love the Mega-Guitars on Kansas City) but mostly a smorgas-bored of available talent putting in their charity work. Zero additives for the video freak and no real explanation of charitable intentions ever given. Borrow this from someone instead."
1,There are far better tapes out there...,"If you are looking for a tape to dance ""with"", this isn't it.It's more like a documentary on dance."
2,Don't try to compare this to any other album.,Bjork shows that she's got the beat. Articulate words from an original voice make this the first of one of the best hi energy CD's I've ever heard. You don't want to mix the remixes either.
2,Great read,Bought this for my mother. She loves to read and this book was great as she could connect with it..
2,Movies I Own U Should 2!!!!!!!!!!!,"Toxie at his best this is one of the greastest TROMA movies ever made I would gladly pay 30 dollars for a movie this good also get the Tox Box***** and the Toxic Crusaders***** It's the cartoon show from when I was kid It's FRESH as HELL. The extra features are great like always with TROMA, you also get a cool Citizen Toxie poster!"
2,Amazingly suspenseful psychological thriller,"This story of a psychotic ventriloquist is truly frightening, especially as portrayed through the gifted Anthony Hopkins. Ann-Margret gives her best performance as his high-school sweetheart stuck in a bad marriage. Based on the novel, the plot is powerful and well-developed. One caution: This video is edited; with the abundant vulgar language of the movie removed. This hurts the impact of the film, but the story is strong enough to overcome this sad bit of editing."
1,Big Band Hits,"I really know nothing about this era of music, but I bought it for my 94 yr. old Mother-in-law and she is not impressed. However, she is picky, so her opinion may not count."
2,50 First Dates,"Adam Sandler plays a guy that is about to giveup on love until he meets Drew Barrymore whohas a short-term memory loss, where she forgetseverything the next day; she can only rememberanything that has happened before the tragicmoment in her life that messed up her brain."
2,We aren't in Kansas anymore,"I enjoyed ""Surrender Dorothy"" very much. However, I would have loved to have know Sarah more before her accident. Her character was not fully developed. I liked her best male friend the best. I found the other characters self-absorbed and often annoying. The overall plot was interesting and often heart-wrenching. The author really made you think about your own mortality and how we can touch and be touched by others people's lives...and the affect we have on each other. Ms. Woltzer shows great insight into the human heart. ""Surrender Dorothy"" was a very quick read."
1,"Stiff, uncomfortable",The soles and laces of these sandals do not flex with your feet. Says it is leather but the laces feel like plastic. Very uncomfortable especially for dancing. Thin soled or would be good for every day use.
2,Another Great Book by Dale Carnegie,"I loved reading Dale Carnegie's books since I picked up How to Win Friends and Influence People. His writing style is very easy to read and he is always giving examples to make the content as clear as possible. That being said, The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking is a great book. I personally preferred How to Win Friends and Influence People over this book, so if you have not read that book, I would recommend reading it first. However, if you are specifically looking for a book on Public Speaking, Dale Carnegie is a great author and he has several books about this topic. This one is great and I recommend it."
2,I loved it.,"I had to choose a novel for an independent reading assignment, so of course, being the striver I am, I had to choose an obscure Faulkner novel. I thought the book was excellent. Faulkner's rich prose helped to develop his deeply southern charachters. The culture of the South and it's deeply imbedded morals were brought out through Faulkner's lengthy sentences and gothic elements such as suspense and enhanced senses. The coming of age story of Chick Mallison and several subplots gave the novel many layers with which to envelop the reader. Overall, the novel turned out to be a tough read that was well worth the time."
1,Worthless Gadget,"Great idea or so I thought. I fell for the marketing hype. This little gadget is nothing more than a time stamp. You plug it in and it reads the time stamp and shows you what was playing on the radio station that you pre-selected when you registered on the web. If you were listening to a different station, you have to look it up on their site, which defeats the purpose of this thing. You can already look up songs on the net without this gadget. In fact, you can do it better without the gadget, because, emarker's coverage is limited (No AM, jazz, classical, or music videos). Save your money!"
2,'Feel good' movie,"Every time I watch this movie, it makes me 'feel GOOD'! It proves that LOVE will find a way (although sometimes it takes a genius to figure out what that way will be).I loved the romantic parts of this movie, especially the idea of the 'first kiss' which Drew Barrymore got to experience over and over because of her short term memory problem.It could have been better without the crude humor but the relationship between Adam Sandler's character and Drew Barrymore's charactor is reason enough to watch this movie.The ending never fails to give me chills..it's heartwarming and terrific!"
1,The okay book,"Hawthornes The Scarlet letter is an okay book. It has an okay plot and okay characters, but the book is not one for teens of the 90's. I had to read this book for my English teacher and to tell the truth if it were not graded I would not have read it. The teens of today do not want to read about the ancient customs of puritan society. If it had been about the scandalous affairs of Hester and Rev. Dimmsdale it would still be a best seller. I think this book should be only read voluntarily. If you are thinking of reading it you may need to reconsider."
1,Should include how to order Converse sizes,"Got her fast, but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back. There should be a note on how to order Converse. One size smaller than your original foot size. Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big."
2,excellent!,"Excellent overview of the history of Paganism. The paperback is in horrible fine print, though. This should be on every bookshelf, as it dispells myths while humanizing the myth makers."
2,Great for any Stargate Fan!,"Too bad good shows do not last forever, but this DVD continues the Stargate tradition. It is good fun!"
2,Coffee Warmer for My Desk,"I bought this warmer for my desk at work. It arrived on Saturday so I gave it a test run on the weekend. It works great, keeps my tea perfectly warm. One word of warning though, if your mug has a wide base to it, it might not fit on the plate. Other than that it just great. I'm very happy."
1,"unusable, avoid it","After 1st wash, even before 1st use. It became unusable: full of tiny cotton balls on the surface; shrank 20% at least; tended break. Note that I did follow the wash direction.Now I have to cut them into pieces and see if they are any good for wiping dirt off my car. It not even worth the return postage."
1,It's Garbage.,"Koontz can write. But he sucks as a story teller. Books are supposed to have a COMPLETE story in them, no? Well this one has no ending. No end at all. These 2 detectives are clued in to the fact that Dr Frankenstein exists, and is creating his ""perfect race"" to some day kill off all humans. That's it. You meet the original, now educated and ""at one with the universe"" Frankenstein's monster, you meet the main characters, and they have some conflict. That's the whole ""story"" in this book, which it really isn't because the basic elements of a story are a beginning, middle, and end."
1,Complete piece of junk,"Had one of these when I was a kid, it was fun so I bought one as a gift for my son. The rocke didn't mate correctly with the pump but we tried gamely to hold it in place and pumped it a few times, at which point the valve on the pump separated from the body. There was virtually no force being applied to this part of the pump, it was a press fit piece that couldn't possibly withstood any real pressure from the pump. It was a total joke, this is not a complicated piece of equipment, it was never built to do anything other than to dupe the consumer."
2,STAYING POWER,"Queen upset a lot of their fan's when they put out ""Hot Space"". At this point, their music headed in the direction of dance.The album only has one hard rock song, which is Brian May's""Put Out The Fire"".""Las Palabras De Amor""is a nicely written ballad.The collabaration ""Under Pressure""w/David Bowie is on this album as well.The guitar lead's on these upbeat dance song's are cool as well.Queen would not be Queen unless they explored and did album's like this. This album is just more variety added to the rollercoaster record catalogue that they have made over the year's.No one could ever put there finger on Queen, or what their new music would sound like. NEW TERRITORY AS ALWAY's-HOT SPACE!!!"
1,Pure pap,"I found this book in the seatback on an Amtrak train from NY to DC so I don't know if it was forgotten or just left as the trash that it is. It took about ten pages to realize that it was just pure sleeze, and i gave up after getting half way through it within 15 minutes. I could slap myself for wasting that much time. I enjoy good erotica, but this is more like pulp putzing."
2,A big hit!,"My 23-month-old LOVES this sticker book. He has been using it almost every day for a month, and he still loves it. I sit with him while he plays with it to help him bring the edges of the stickers up from the pages. The stickers are losing their stickiness now, but it was a good deal for a month of play!"
2,Information,"Firstly, Escaflowne is a great classic anime, and one of my personal favorites. The visuals are a bit dated (1995), but what made the show was the plot, the world, and the audio!2nd, All of the Escaflowne CDs are incredible. Especially lovers only (a 'best of' for the series), and the movie soundtrack. This is all due to the work of Yoko Kanno (Cowboy bebop, darker than black, Macross, RahXephon, among other greats). Escaflowne may be my favorite of all her work, but everything she touches turns to gold.Lastly, the CD Info, because it is often hard to find the correct information:The Vision of Escaflowne OST 3Yoko Kanno19961 Short Notice2 Arcadia3 Epistle4 Farewell5 Aoi Hitomi6 Perfect World7 I Recomment Instincts8 Scrappy9 Shrilly10 Revenge11 Illusion12 Blaze13 Fatal14 Hikari No Naka E15 Again"
1,THIS IS KINDA INSULTING TO THE FIRST TWO MOVIES,"OCP PLANS ON DESTROYING DETROIT TO BUILD DELTA CITY. BUT, WHEN A GANG OF ANGERED RESIDENTS DECIDE TO FIGHT OCP BACK, PROBLEMS IMMEDIATELY BEGIN. TO ADD TO THE PROBLEMS, ROBOCOP [PLAYED HERE BY ROBERT JOHN BURKE] JOINS THE PEOPLE IN THEIR QUEST FOR FREEDOM. NOT AS VIOLENT AS THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, AND IT'S ALSO NOT AS GOOD. THE BIGGEST MISTAKE THEY MADE WITH THIS MOVIE WAS TO REPLACE PETER WELLER AS ROBOCOP. ROBERT JOHN BURKE JUST SEEMS LOST AS ROBOCOP. THIS SERIES WAS SERIOUSLY STARTING TO RUN OUT OF STEAM TOWARD THIS POINT. WHY COULDN'T THEY JUST KEEP THIS ONE ON THE SHELF? ANYWAY, ANOTHER BIG MISTAKE THEY MADE WAS TO HAVE ANN, ROBO'S PARTNER FROM THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, GET KILLED. HAS A FEW GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES, BUT IT'S SERIOUSLY LACKING THE ENTERTAINMENT THAT CAME WITH THE FIRST TWO MOVIES. IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THIS BUT YOU WANNA SEE IT, RENT THIS, BUT DON'T BUY THIS. FOLLOWED BY FOUR DIRECT-TO-VIDEO MOVIES."
1,Definitive of what?,"A bad idea?I agree with Kireviewer, if you care about the music, it's hard to get past the dumb opening, a host who even Will Rodgers couldn't like, a set apparently built in a high school shop class, and the many annoying interruptions. They took a too short concert, and turned it into a bad, too long music video. I guess the mindless filler was necessary to get the length up to the claimed 1 hour. The music is OK, but it was neither the band's best period, nor their best work."
2,Deeper meaning of LIFF,"The book has become a bible to live a NORMAL life Knowing there are others out there who are sane but strangeFind the Yahoo club site ""LIFF AS WE KNOW IT"" to wallow in humour. Then send your own efforts (ie photo's and new WORDS)"
1,rip off of the beatles,"what the hell is this. 5 loosers from enlgand trying to copy the beatles. i mean even there fans are so stuipid. i read one review which one of the oasis fans criticized thebeatles for being a rip off of OASIS. hello dude the beatles were 1963 and oasis is 1994. that should be enough to skip this album and get hte better of these clones THE BEATLES.r.i.P. JOHN LENNON, GEORGE HARRISONTHEY MUST BE TURNING IN THERE GRAVES"
1,Could have been better,"Or should I have said, should have been better. Clay Aiken was one of the perfomers from AI2 that I fell in love with. What happened to this new CD is anybody's guess. All I know it that this wasn't up to Clay standards and probably should not have been released so quickly. I liked Measure of a Man but that was about it and even it was lacking."
1,New material,"I am a huge Clay fan, but I am extremely disappointed in this CD. The man can sing like no one else, but he had to sing songs that were less than stellar, to say the least. Give him some great songs to sing, and he'll do right by them."
2,A wonderful movie,This was the greatest movie! Anyone would like it~! I would tell anyone/everyone to see it! You should add this great one to your westerns!
1,They leak when regular swaddler diapers don't,"I originally bought these diapers for my daughter to wear at night. They leaked so badly that I couldn't use them. My daughter would be soaked from her chest clear down to her socks. Of course she would wake up early. I had to wash all of her bedding and her jammies every night. You can imagine what the scene looked like when she pooped! To get rid of this box of diapers, I used them during day use, but, again, the swaddlers worked better and seemed more comfortable for my daughter. The Baby Dry seemed very thin and very uncomfortable....almost papery. Not good."
1,it is a joke,"this bottle warmer is just a joke. It takes forever to warm a cold bottle up. I say "" forever"", it is forever. When I checked the power, it is only 13W. If you do the math, you know the energy the warmer produces may take forever to reach the heat to warm a bottle up."
1,DO NOT waste your money or time,"This isn't even worth it for a basic collector. There isn't a temperature display, but the large problem here is that the temperature control switch offers NO range at all. You could for example set it to highest or lowest settings and get no difference AT All in actual temperature. Not only that but the temperature is too cold for red wine to be properly stored. I hate to be a perfectionist here but hey, isn't that why we buy these things in the first place? I've spoken with other former owners of this hassle of a cooler and heard the same review. The best part was when I called to tell Danby of the problem customer service told me the problem was an isolated problem they've never had before and that the temperature should be able to be adjusted. SO I sent back and received another, then another. None of them ever got warmer (or colder) than 45 degrees and I have sent it back a final time. KEEP SHOPPING AROUND!"
1,Very uncomfortable,"I've been trying to love these shoes for three weeks now but all I have to show for my effort is a foot full of blisters. I bought them from a very reputable running store where I know all of the employees and I'm quite sure the fit was fine. But hey, you may have a different experience.I've also found that the run itself is alot harder on my knees than the runs I take with my Asics 2090s.Finally, be careful in making your color selection. It's fun to sport the yellow but it's really, really hard to coordinate this color with anything in your wardrobe."
2,Intelligent novel about Hindu gods on another planet,"A surprisingly good book, given its inherently problematic nature: a group of white people pretend to be Hindu gods on another planet. Yet Zelazny appears to have done his research, creating a rich world and using the character of Siddhartha to skillfully question the ways of the ""gods"". The world rang true, to my admittedly limited experience of Asia, but that's more than some books about Asia manage. Lord of Light is a book that wears its problematic nature on its sleeve, and opens itself for the attendant discussion. Also, it tells a good story."
1,This ain't no economics book!,"I was expecting a book on economics 101, so maybe I might understand market forces, PE ratios, stuff like that.It's just a big argument for a libertarian government. Not even particularly good arguments either - they're all based on metaphors, like the broken window (paraphrased from memory):'Even though they may get paid, a community does not get rich fixing broken windows. That holds the community still, it does not push it forward.'That's a fine argument and all, but that's not teaching. Metaphors are mental manipulation... give me all the pros and cons and let me decide. Or better: give me the damn facts.And it's outdated too. The book is 50 years old. We are so NOT in Post WWII economics."
1,dawn on a distant shore,"Very disapointing. I loved Into the Wilderness and could not wait for DDS, signing up for delivery before it came out in print. I found it difficult to get into and just didn't keep my attention. I actually had to force myself to sit down and finish it. Sadly, DDS lacked the excitement and sexual tensions of Into the Wilderness. Definately not Sara Donati's best work."
2,"The Other, The Best","""The Other"" is the best horror story I have ever read. The atmosphere is chilling, austere, and creepy throughout. I read it while camping in Europe more than 20 years ago and got to the thrilling, surprise plot twist deep in the night. This twist produced an electric shudder in the gut. Written from the perspective of one of a set of young twin boys, the inner dialogue of this character feels genuine. The plot speeds you along on a can't-put-it-down read, despite much interior action."
1,"Dull, Disjointed","Two hundred pages into the book, and I'm still waiting for a cogent theme to emerge. Poorly written, poorly documented, and thin...in other words, perfect fodder for a commercial movie."
1,Worst book by LJ!,"Totally hated this book. Now, don't get me wrong, I love LJS and most of her books. Actually, all of her books except this one. Totally borring and predictable."
2,good but not perfect,"It is very good for kid more than 1 month . Only one thing i want to say when my baby used it at 1 month ,she grew some rash, but not very serious . So i appreciate pamper all the same . Thanks for supplying quality goods to us."
2,Pete Seeger's Greatest Hits.,"Really nice CD for a general overview of Pete Seeger's music through the years. I'm still looking for a CD that has the music from the DVD ""Power of Song"" on it. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.Ann Louise Ramsey"
1,The worse.,"Dull, loud and boring adaptation of the classic horror comic book lacks a real leading man for the movie to fly with its bad script and almost as bad special effects. While Keanu fails miserably in his role, his co-star Rachel Weisz does more for this movie than the movie does for her, giving her character a real sense of grace and strong will despite the lousy dialog, badly written characters and insane plot clichÃ©s that is surrounding her during the course of the movie. Weisz's performance alone is worth the price of the movie ticket but other than her, there is really no reason rush to see the bad film.My Suggestion? Wait for DVD."
1,Very boring,"I agree with the reviewer who is not the author. This is really a bad book. Totally not believable with no depth to the characters. I find it hard to believe this book is so popular overseas. I should consider writing for a living. I think the author is a little touchy, too. I guess it was too much for her that someone didn't like her boring book."
2,I love my TiVo,"This is the second TiVo DVR I've owned. I really like the dual tuner feature. I prefer using the TiVo DVR to the DVRs my local cable company rents. One of my favorite features is that when you fast forward or rewind, this DVR compensates for that split second it takes from the time you recognize the end of a commercial and the time you release the fast forward feature. TiVo builds in a slight ""jump back"" feature, which the Comcast's DVRs don't have. I also like the TiVo Desktop software which I've installed onto my home computer. With my home network, I can transfer shows from the DVR to my computer's hard drive."
2,One Who Appreciates Good Guitar Jazz,"Veteran guitarist Herb Ellis and and a somewhat newcomber guitarist Duke Roubillard showcase some fine jazz guitar interplay.Even if you're not a jazz fan, you'll appreciate this fine playing. This quintet presents three Roubillard originals with four standards.You'll hear the similarity between this album and the Great Guitar albums from past years. A fine addition to any guitar jazz lover's collection."
2,GREAT!!! and slow cost!!! BUT!!,"This product works great once you figure out how to connect it. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. The price is perfect for someone one on a budget. The instruction on the manual are not clear, i followed the instruction and was ruinning into problems when I tried to connect to my secured network. I had to go to the manufacturer website and download the most up to date driver and then use zero config when i right clicked on the icon on my desktop. I then let windowsXP detect the many wireless connection in my area. Once I clicked on my network and used my password this thing just work like magic. Connection, speed is awesome."
1,2 stars cuz hes ok I GUESS,u know that INVISIBLE song? he strikes me to be a stalker..lol this isn't really a song to sing to if u know the message behind the song....LOL scary!...im not a fan of the American Idol show but i luv to hear about the cheap cheap hilarious people that go on the show like william hung....LOL NOW THAT KILLS ME..really clay aiken i dont know what to say about you but that invisible song really makes me think twice about you
1,Review of Chi Running,"I thought this book was pretty much a waste of time. A good friend of mine who is a practitioner of Chinese medicine recommended the book to me because he knows I'm a runner. He told me a little bit of what the book talks about before I bought it. Honestly, I got more out of that conversation about the book than I got out of the book itself. Turns out, I already practice ""chi-running."" The basic idea is to be aware of your breathing and your body while you run and work on having good form. Yeah, thanks, I learned that in high school cross country, except without the unnecessary baggage of eastern philosophy that Dreyer packages with the obvious running advice he gives."
1,Good ONLY for total beginner,I came away with literally nothing new from this book. If you have read many web forums or other books- this is aimed at complete newbies.I also didn't like the writing style or editing. If you know the very basics and don't want to be 'spoken' to like a 5yr old get Andy Stanford's excellent Surgical Speed Shooting.I am just not the target audience for this material.
2,Excellent!,"Great album, great band. Who doesn't like the Black Keys? Get all of their albums, you won't regret it! 5 star, no doubt!"
2,Awesome Product,"I bought this for my fiancÃ© for during foreplay it was the best thing I bought her! She loves it it makes her go wild she has gets so horny while I use it on her and it makes sex a million times better! She goes crazy while I pleasure her with this vibrator! Than durig sex she is amazing! It was definatly a great added touch to our sex life! If any guys Re lookin to please there women to the max and than have crazy sex afterwords, buy this product cause you will have an expierance of a life time! Awesome product and work amazing! And this is the best price I found on the Internet! Everywhere else I looked was a lot more than amazon! Good luck"
2,Mega Playland,"I purchased this as a gift for my grandson's 2nd birthday, knowing that his 4year old brother would be playing with it just as much, so needed something that was big enough to share without causing conflict. The main reason for this particular type of pop-up tent was just that, it pops up. We've had the ones with the poles before and they are such a nuisance to assemble and take apart. These 5 pieces went up in about 8 minutes and were taken down in about 5, you cannot ask more than that. We'll have to see how long they all last, but so far, both boys are having a great time sinking basketballs and pretending whatever it is they pretend. If it lasts just the one season, I'll be happy, everything else is gravy."
2,"if you're angry, get it now !","This album is the very definition of metalcore.Very heavy songs, filled with anger and pain.I give it 4 stars because I think some lyrics could 've been improved, and some songs sound the same, But It's suerely a good album. Worlds apart is my favourite song."
1,This movie was horrible.,Awful and down right degrading horror freak show that has Keanu Reeves redoing his Matrix role for a supernatural tale that makes no sense in what it was trying to accomplish. The screenwriters of this film look like they were making all of this up while they were going along and the cinematography is murky at best. Not even the special effects were up to what they are in terms of what is standard now and you can see how bad they look once you see some of the demons are in the light. Some of the acting is very good with Rachel Weisz doing much more than she should have for this movie but the movie falls on the shoulders of Keanu Reeves and he rather be Neo than a real character.Wait for Video instead of paying for it.
1,Not the best in the series,"Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one."
2,He likes it!,"I bought this as a gift for my husband and the more he uses it, the more he is thrilled with it. Only downside is the weight."
2,Worth the Purchase if You Own an HDTV,"I bought this DVD set as my first foray into the world of Blu-Ray and I must say I am not disappointed. The picture quality (especially on Spider-Man 2 & 3) pops off the screen even in 720p. If you're thinking of buying these movies in HD I'm sure you've seen them already in some other format so I won't bother reviewing the films themselves. The reason I gave these DVDs 4 stars instead of 5, however, is because of the complete lack of extras on the first two movies. Also the amount of grain is higher in dark scenes in Spider-Man compared to the other 2 sequels (which have almost none). Other than these small complaints I would say definitely pick this set up if you want some nice demo discs for your collection."
2,PCI Express Book Review,This book provides an another resource in addition to the PCI Express Specification. This is helpful since I'm at a small company where no one else is working on PCI Express at the moment. The book is well written and well organized. It is useful to me as a system architect as well as the other guys in my group who will be the designers on our next ASIC project.
2,Excellent Product,"This has been really helpful for maintaining protein levels after my surgery. It really mixes well with sweet or savory foods. The only issue is that you can't get it too hot; if you want to add it to soup, you've got to let it cool a bit first."
1,One of the most unreadable books ever!,"Which should be the only reason one would have this book in a collection.Daferring on red hair moots the ramdelgerag!

1,Not worth buying!,"I am a huge Mad Max fan, so when I found this copy I was really happy (it's hard to find in store) I waited for it to get delivered and sat down with the partner to watch, only I was so disappointed when it was finished as they have cut out half of the original movie!!!Majority of the major scenes are no where to be seen!!I must admit this is the first time I have been let down by Amazon, but with such a classic movie (with the correct rating) why was there any reason to cut out soooooo much of it, for a person who may not have seen this before, they would have no real idea as to what the movie is!!!"
1,"This generations ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""","What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved. Other than them, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie."
1,Danger.....,"Watch out for this turkey! Definitely a disk for the true believers only. Sound quality as bad as any bootleg I have ever listened to, some songs fade (on a live album!?) and skimpy liner notes add up to a pretty bad package. And the addition of a keyboard player seems to hurt rather than add to WA's sound. If you are dying for a live disk from WA's ""Locked In"" tour, this will have to do. Otherwise, save your money."
1,bad,The cushions fell apart- split in half and does not stay on your feet. Do not buy- very poor product.
1,Mildly entertaining at best,"This movie had bad acting and a thin plot. Could have been much better. Lots of action, lots of explosions but didn't seem like a good Blu-ray quality movie. It killed 2 hours but nothing i would recommend to a friend to watch."
1,A Stargate Movie,"My thoughts on this are really simple. Go to Google and type in ""SG-1 Movie Sneak Peak"". Watch it. That's all you'll need to know. I sat through this DVD when the lights were out during Gustav. We'd been without power for three days and watched it from a laptop computer. The whole family loves Stargate and we were desperate for entertainment.During the movie...We. Were. Bored. To. Tears. I actually stopped watching at one point. Since I post my reviews on Amazon, I have to give it something. One out of five and again, that's only because I have to cough up something."

2,Mysterious hospital deaths,"Judith McMonigle Flynn needs to have a hip replacement, coincidentally at the same time that her cousin Renie is having shoulder surgery. They are a little apprehensive about their admission to Good Cheer Hospital, because there seems to be a rash of deaths of basically healthy people who have recently had surgery at the hospital. There is a rumor of a takeover of Good Cheer and there are plenty of quirky hospital employees as well as relatives of the deceased which gives Judith a long list of suspects. Her husband is working on a case dealing with homeless people and Judith suspects that there is a connection to the case she's working on. Undaunted by her surgery, Judith travels around the hospital in her wheel chair and, as usual, manages to solve the mystery before the police. This is another enjoyable book in the Bed-and-Breakfast series."
1,Rubber tipped mallets,"I bought these little rubber mallets for my glockenspeil, it was a bad idea. The sound is muted and they do not work, stick with conventional plastic or wood."
2,Prophetic and Frightening,Orwell was a prophet. He introduced such words into our vocabulary as 'newspeak' and 'thoughtcrime' which have forever changed the way we look at government. No one who hasn't read 1984 can truly call themselves politically literate.
2,I'm stuck on Moonstruck,"This is a delightful romantic comedy. Cher does a wonderful job of changing from a frumpy, overworked fiancee to a glamorous, sexy girlfriend of Nicholas Cage. Good performances by everyone."
2,My daughter and I both loved it,"Best primer on stats existing. I've read it several times; my daughter read it at age 13 and both enjoyed and understood it. She's coaching her undergrad friends in college stats now, and even more importantly, analyzes news and thinks critically about it.A well-written, timeless book!"
1,Neat package but very grainy indoor quality,"Things I like...- price- sizeThing I didn't like and made me return- performance under regular indoor house lighting very grainy and considerably worse than my 8mm analog. Doing further research it appears this is likely not unique to Canon but common to DV camcorders. I am going to stick with my 8mm for a couple of years until DV tech improves since much of my use is indoors filming kids, etc."
2,Pat and Mike,"Pat and Mike is a lovely story of a star athlete, played by Katharine Hepburn, who is discovered by a sport's manager, Spencer Tracy. Hepburn's character realizes that she is going to be watched every minute of every day while in training. This companionship between athlete and manager finally turns to love.In Pat and Mike, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy again play opposite each other. Hepburn also gets to show off the skills in sports and physical agility, which she posesses in real life."
1,Character sheets with different pictures,"Well, I expected this to contain a bunch of character sheets customized for the different occupations. Instead all it is is a few character sheets that have the picture from the main book of the different drawings of the different occupations and then a bunch of blank character sheets that you can download from the website for free. Also they are bound in the book so you can't take them out to photo copy them without tearing them out, or you just leave them in there but there is no customization at all. They're all the same. Really not worth buying. Just go to www.sengoku.com and download the character sheet for free and if you really want a picture in the blank space just photocopy it from the main book and paste it in."
1,Help!,"Hello everybody! I ordered this product but the first one that i received didn't work, and now i have the second one and it still doesn't work. It might sound weird, but i put batteries in it and it doesn't start working. What should i do? Thanks!"
1,Not an OUTDOOR antenna,"Beware, although this is advertised an an indoor/outdoor antenna, it is not. It is INDOOR ONLY. So I ended up returning the item and by the time I paid the shipping BOTH directions, I was within $15 of what the antenna cost!!!DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU NEED AN OUTDOOR ANTENNA"
2,This book saved my life,"If anyone is going through the hell of being stalked, or even think they are being stalked, they MUST by Detective Proctor's book ""How to Stop A Stalker""I have read other ""stalking"" books, and they have been helpful, but none to the extent of Detective Proctor's book.The information, the suggestions, everything is a MUST for someone being stalked.He UNDERSTANDS, something that I didn't feel from the other stalking books.Detective Proctor knows the reality and horror of stalking in an easy read and extremely informative book.This book is up to date (unlike some of the other Stalking books) and my only problem is that he doesn't have a sequel. Hopefully that is something he is working on.I give this book ten stars. This book literally saved my life and it can save yours.If you, a friend, or a family member are being stalked, you must read this book."
1,"A book for kids, not adults","This is a pleasant, rather hokey coming-of-age tale that seems addressed to kids of 11 or 12, not to grownups. I don't understand why this isn't being marketed as a children's book, as it really has little to hold an adult reader's interest. The plot is very familiar and sentimental, and the writing is clear, uncluttered, and plain but not interesting in its own right. Buy it for your school-age son, but not for your father."
2,Bess 'tainment EVER!!,Th' Squidbillies kin be watched on over an' on over agin. Th' episodes is so fast thet yo' miss most of it th' fust few times through. Eff'n yo' like hilarity made by 'mericans in 'merica fo' 'mericans then this hyar is th' video fo' yo'! Fry mah hide!!
2,A new old fantasy,"A very good book with a lot of fun. It's a little slow at the start, but once things get moving, it become worth the wait. In fact, this was a book in which its ending justified its beginning. It's a fantasy story which reminds us that all fantasy stories do not have to be about Tolkien and such. Every review I see of this book likens it to Alice, Dorothy, and friends. While this book does touch on that type of fantasy, it also contains a contemporary view which gives it a flavor all its own -- a new old fantasy. Pick it up, read it. You won't soon forget it."
1,The Kindle version costs more than the paperback,"As of this review, the Kindle edition cost $12.99 and the paperback cost $10.88 - or over $2 more expensive for a digital version that actually saves the publisher money. I actually enjoy Dharma Bums, but Penguin should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for this. I wanted to reread this on my Kindle, but Penguin has decided to screw the readers who keep its business afloat. I'll be sure to keep this in mind for future purchases.Also, for those who will bash my review, the cost of the book is an essential to the value proposition of a book. There are constant bad reviews for publishers that break up short story collection and sell them individually for the price of an individual book. This is no different. Penguin wants me to spend nearly $300 for a Kindle and a case so that they can charge me more for books, all while they save money on production costs??? You've got to be joking!"
1,I read almost 5 pages!,"An earthquake opens a crack in the earth, the parents fall in, and it slams shut!?!?!? That's the best Auel could do? Has that EVER happened in history to ANYONE?I read that and threw the book in the trash. And it wasn't even my copy!"
1,Not a great movie!,I thought it was pretty bad. Hostel was better than this crap. I mean it was ok in some parts but I didn't expect much. It's not even scary. I can't wait to watch Hostel 2 when it comes out.
1,so sad,"I see why clay was'nt nominated for a grammy, this cd is not grammy material, this cd is strickly for those who have bad taste in music, all though I think clay has a desent voice he need to get better writers for his music...but I guess all that matters is his fan's are happy, however Kelly, Ruben and now Fantasia there the real product, getting a million dollar contract is the icing on the cake, that's how you can tell the winner's from the losers."
2,Batman Begins well!!!,"It's no Dark Knight, but then again, what is...anyway, still better than all the ""original"" Batman movies. At least the quality of the video is great."
1,"Worst of theYear...or, maybe the decade","Where did the real Jack Higgins go? This is not only Higgin's worst effort to date, it is probably the worst book I've read in the past 5 years. (Can you say 'lazy', Jack?)I can't believe I actually finished it, and one star is a generous rating. Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter, no character or plot development, written like a 5th grader.The end of the book foretells a sequel...a book that I will immediately pass on. Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first.Don't buy it -- don't borrow it -- don't read it."
1,Waste of time,"There are movies that make you wonder what's going on, but they do so on purpose. In this movie, I was confused from the start and obviously not on purpose. It has no actual plot just an excuse for more graphics. Where as 1st movie had some plot, the last 2 had none. Waste of time."
1,OK,I really like songs for a new world and the last 5 years. was excited to purchase this disc but was kinda disappointed. lacks the edgy variation and creativity of the others. not bad and the cover track is fun--just not up to the success of the other jason robert brown work.
1,The mask of Zero,"Apparently, the only path to wisdom and a life packed with acts of kindness is arse freezing and sword and/or kickboxing tricks.Ridiculous movie designed for brainless pimpled teenagers.Nauseating philosophy wrapping grandiloquent dialogues.At least the Rambo suite was honest entertainment."
1,coulda been betta!!!!!!!!,the special effects sucked and we've seen good special effects and the special effects in the odessy were crap and in comparison to a lot of movies we've seen it was pretty crap. it was realy BORING! (...) we've seen and weve seen heaps of them and some of them were realy gory over all COULDA BEEN BETTA!!!!!
2,Does what it should do.,"Works fine, seems to be as well made as you are going to get in a cheap consumer electronics accessory. Ordered on Friday, arrived on Monday - can't beat that for service."
1,Four Star Music - get the other edition though,"Capitol's 1990 reissue of The Beach Boys' 1960s LPs gave us 2 of these albums on 1 CD at normal price. They're back for who knows how long - so get them while they're hot. On the 2-fer version of ""Little Deuce Coupe,"" which is in STEREO by the way and not MONO as it is here, you also get ""All Summer Long"" plus you get a nice stack of bonus tracks. Don't pass up this warning - and get the 2-fer instead - quick!"
2,Where is Perry in the middle of the season?,I love the Perry Mason series so I would buy the set anyway but you should know that in several of the episodes Perry is in the hospital and stars are brought in to replace him. Otherwise I love the season 6 set.
2,A Beautiful Book,"I bought a similar Inga Moore version of this book for my son and we love it. The text has been ""sensitively abridged"" to make it appropriate for young children and the result is a delightful story that brings small animals to vivid life. Inga Moore's illustrations are what drew me to this book. They are wonderfully detailed and evocative of the beauty of the Thames Valley."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought the Alpha Diamante Cristalli Illuminating shampoo and conditioner, the first time I used it I didn't like the results but after the third time of use this product cause my haird to be extremely dry causing scabs on my scalp I discontinued but this was a waste of money and my hair is worse."
1,No Footnotes?!,"I was very disappointed to find the footnotes missing from this edition. If there's a way to get to them, I couldn't find it & Pratchett's footnotes are a significant part of the humor. So buy the print version of the Discworld books - and do buy them. Prachett is always entertaining!"
1,Buyer Beware - Defective Cards!,"Purchased SimpleTech 256 MB CF card to supplement the meager 32MB CF card which came with my new Canon A80 Camera.After a dozen pictures taken with the SimpleTech card, started getting CF errors on the camera display.Reviewed the Canon owners manual for this error, and acted upon the recommendation to format the card. After reformatting the SimpleTech card, still receive CF Errors when using in the camera after 1 or 2 photos. I am returning the SimpleTech card through Amazon's wonderful return policy. I really do love this e-tailer!My ""meager"" Cannon 32MB card is chugging along just fine...."
2,SIMON SAYS: GORE!!!,"Just watched this on FearNet and will definitely buy this on dvd! I love crappy, gorey, over the top films and while it breaks no ground it harkens back to the beloved films of the 1980's that throw away plot and logic for gore gags and fun. Crispin Glover is great as Simon and this movie delivers on all levels. Fans of the original Mother's Day, Texas Chainsaw 2 and others of this ilk will enjoy this. I am not saying it is as good them, but good for a chuckle and midnight rewatching. Recommended!"
2,Funny--especially if you're into SpongeBob.,"I had the pleasure of seeing this movie ALONE in a movie theater. That's right--by coincidence, I was the only one in the theater.SpongeBob is a pretty good animated movie. The opening sequence is original and funny. For some reason, it wasn't quite as funny as the TV show is, but it was still pretty good. I missed SpongeBob's squirelly girlfriend, but other than that I enjoyed every minute.Best part: when Spongebob and Patrick dry up on land. Almost brings a tear to your eye! Worst part: Seeing David Hasselhoff's leg hair. Ugh!Overall, I recommend this movie to all Spongebob fans."
1,Not so Hotline to Murder!,I thought this was written by an inexperienced mystery writer. Not suspenseful or even very special in writing style. Very humdrum.
2,IZ---mixed reactions,"I love that I can play my ipod through IZ... although I could do without the farting and burping or the outbursts in the middle of my music. I suppose for kids, IZ can be pretty amusing. Overall, it's not a disappointment, but it can be annoying if you're not in the right mood!"
1,Unacceptable,"We started out with Pampers Swaddlers from newborn to Size 2-3 which is the largest that they make. These were hands down the best diapers we have tried during the first year. After our daughter outgrew the Swaddlers we tried Pampers Cruisers and were a little disappointed, however the Cruisers did their job of keeping everything where it was supposed to be. I saw the reviews for Baby Dry and thought ""hey let's try these and see if they are better than Cruisers"" BIG MISTAKE. We received the diapers yesterday and have already had multiple leaks and overflows. These diapers have almost no absorbency and need to be changed approximately every 2 hours for us. We made the mistake of using it overnight and the entire bed was soaking wet this morning.These diapers may work for some, however I can't believe that they would work for many considering how little they can hold. Buyer beware."
1,Wouldn't recommend,"The sizing of this costume was fairly accurate but it very cheaply made. After only a few wears, the mask and belt both broke. I wouldn't recommend this costume."
1,Negative Stars! Avoid like flesh eating bacteria!,"""Lets jiggel the camera to show that the ground is shakeing!""Special effects; haloween leftovers.Acting; Well, the cast managed to repeat memorized lines.Casting apears to have been done in a trailer park.Script; I know nine year olds who write better stories.Cinimatography; Someones home cam.Conclusion: Anoyingly boreing and essentially unwatchable waist of time and money."
1,Please email me tell me why this is not drivel,"My daughter just finished her first year as a literature major at an Ivy League school and we spoke about Finnegans Wake.For years, I have asked English Lit experts what is the genius of Finnegans Wake. No one could give me a straightThe Emperor has no clothes. No one knows why this is great, save for some so called experts who extol this book.I beg of anyone out there, please email me tell me why this is not drivel. You can reach me at alkruse@gmail.com"
1,"Bad, bad, boring, bad","I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. I was ready and willing to be proven wrong about my negative impression of Brendan Fraser's acting ability, based on what others had said of this film, but ended up with further confirmation that he is a lousy actor. I ordinarily like movies that are slow moving and antithetical to shoot-em-up blockbusters, but this picture C...R...A...W...L...E...D..., and suffered from dry dialogue, to boot. On top of everything else, this film was predictable, and I continued watching only to see if a fantastic surprise ending would redeem it. No dice- the end certainly did not justify the tedious means.In addition to a badly written script and substandard acting, the actors' accents seemed overdone (too theatric) and fake. It was a real drag to watch this movie."
2,very good,this product is awesome. it hide all your secrets. I would recommend this product to all women and men. I will buy product again.
1,Hair Off Instant Eyebrow Shapers Cold Wax Strips 18's,Hair Off Instant Eyebrow Shapers Cold Wax Strips 18's didn't really did not work for me so I will not be buying this brand anymore
2,"Quite simply, the best album they've ever released","Possibly the best album to come out of Britain in the 1990s, and definitely Oasis' best work to date ""Definitely Maybe"" is admittedly brash and raw, but is as of yet the only album to even come near to showing Oasis' true potential.The high points are the thumping opener, ""Rock 'n Roll Star"", the tenderness of ""Slide Away"", and the majestic anthem that is ""Live Forever"", but the album is undeniably a classic in its entirety.If you like Oasis, buy it. (If you haven't already bought it.) If not, buy it anyway. It shows that there's more to Oasis than limpid ""ballads"" and sub-standard Beatles rip-offs.Make no mistake, ""Definitely Maybe"" is the finest album Oasis have ever released."
2,"Great diapers, great value","I've been buying these diapers since my 1.5 year old was born. I briefly tried Luvs and Huggies and have found that these are so much better, softer, less leakage. Plus it's a great value."
2,great book,This is a classic book that I have always loved and now can read on my Kindle. Glad to see it free!
2,Very pleased:),"I bought this strictly for decoration. Its really nice, better quality than I expected!! Has a nice weight to it and seems extremely durable for sure. Highly recommend!"
2,Beautiful Puzzle,"Another great puzzle by Sunsout. This is the more traditional squarish design rather than the nice widescreen-sized puzzles, of which I am becoming quite fond. That is the only reason I made this a four-star review rather than a five-star. The pieces on this one, while nice with a superb amount of variety in them, are average in size, making this puzzle fragile like typical puzzles once put together.The many different blues in this puzzle are incredible and really make this a very beautiful item. There was just the right amount of difference in the shades that it was not too hard to put together. The mix of gold shades in the wisemen and the camels stand out just enough in contrast to the blues.Very good puzzle!"
1,Signs of the times,"Deceivers will rise up from among you and deceive many.This book is just a copycat of many books before it from Richard Foster,etal. This list of so-called Disciplines is straight from Richard Foster's Spiritual Formation curriculum, in which the occultist centering prayer method is taught. It is occultist to the core, but dressed up nicely as Christian."
1,Worst Printer Ever!,This is hands down the worst printer I've ever had...it takes about 5 times the amount of time it should to print anything because of constant paper feed issues...do not get this product!
1,This is a camera?? Sold in retail stores???,"I wish I could rate this camera -9999999999999999999999999999999. Actually what I really wish is to mound all of the Vivitar Vivicam 55 cameras up in a pile and BURN THEM. Anyway, I found this camera at Walmart thinking it should be good for the $20 price tag they were asking. When I first opened this wannabe camera I noticed the buttons were very cheap. More than half the pictures taken were either blurry and/or yellowed. Don't bother trying to create a video with this thing unless you like a still frame video. I brought it back after I did some research and found the Logitech C310 Webcam for several dollars more here on Amazon(which has HD!). This is the worst camera i have EVER used. Live and learn, and never buy anything made by Vivitar. Shop around and spend a few extra dollars for a better camera. If not, you get what you pay for."
1,Not worth watching. Stopped after 50 minutes.,"The movie started out poorly and went down hill from there. I was waiting for it to get better and realized after 30 minutes it was only going to get worse. Stopped after 50 minutes. I just could not waste any more time on this movie. If you read reviews before watching a movie and there are this many bad reviews, don't watch."
2,Can't go wrong with Corcoran!,"Well made, great tread for walking in snow, sand and standing to work in all day long, I bought these for my partner and he stands at his job all day long and will only wear combat boots. His last pair of combat books were jump boots and the sole did not last. As a former military wife I would never buy anything but a Corcoran boot. The field work boot looks like it will be up to the wear and tear he puts on his footwear plus the soul is thick and has a great tread. We received them in record time to ""boot!"" THANKS! You cannot CANNOT GO WRONG with Corcoran's no matter what cut or style!"
2,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a very nice story. I think my Wife bought it for our Grand Daughter because she and our Daughter both loved it.
1,Don't bother,"I thought Pampers were Pampers. I was so wrong. Pampers Dry Baby diapers are very thin and when soiled are completely saturated with waste. I change my baby about every 20-30 minutes when he's up and these diapers are awful. Overnight they are not even close to adequate, they stink & leak up his back. Just don't bother and get Swaddlers instead. 2 stars because I got them for 16 cents each with Amazon Mom. I now have 253 diapers to get rid of because I wanted to save some $."
1,stay away,"Bought this item for my son for christmas, the rollers will not turn, looks like I wasted my money, buyer beware!"
2,A definate classic - must see for any horror fan!!!,"This one is definately one of the Top Ten best horror films of all times. I've found that horror flicks shot in the 60s and 70s tend to be dull and lackluster, absent of any real scares. Of course, many have good plots, which is why Hollywood ressurects them from time to time with new casts, etc. But, Rosemary's Baby really stands the test of time. There are some genuinely suspenseful and ""spooky"" moments - and it's a clever movie as well. I'd definately recommend it, and I'm a pretty tough critic.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."
2,Great value.,"I never owned a fixed blade knife. Love the fixed blade. Small, blade is very secure and won't wobble or come out.However, I can not say the same for the retractable knife. I've had the blade pop out several times due to side torque on the blade. There is a ""feature"" of the knife that allows the blade to be changed without opening the tool. This feature also allows the blade to come loose without opening the tool.I recommend the set simply because of the price/value combination. There are much better retractable blade knives, but not many that match the value of this set. Can not give 5 stars because of design flaw of retractable knife."
1,a disappointing end to a great series,"I've been following this series all the way from its beginning with the Empire of the East series and I was extremely disappointed with the seemingly rushed way this one was written. Egad, what a goofy way to explain the Emperor figure. I was hoping for an intelligent tie in back to the Empire of the East premise, but ah well. The rest of the series is great."
2,Amazing voice,"This review goes for the audio cassettes. Gary Sinise's voice is really incredibly versatile and convincing. I was amazed by the emphasis in his Crook's monologue ""Books ain't no good... A guy needs someone to be near'm..."". Also George's ""Guys like us are the loneliest guys in the world..."" and of course Lennie's and old Candy's. Such different characters and he can display such a variety and richness of detail in the voices for each of them. Really something to hear."
1,Incompatible with windows7,"OK, I bought this card after reading all the nice reviews, but in fact, it sucks. The official website doesn't have a driver for windows 7. It took me hours to find a driver from its chip manufactur. Now the computer finally recognized the card and can be connected to the router, but 80% of the time, the only thing you see when opening up a browswer is ""server not found"". It's on its way back to amazon. If you are eager to try out windows 7 when it's out, avoid this card as best as you can."
2,"Love Pampers, hate the price",I love Pampers diapers but hate the price. I always buy Pampers for use overnight because they are one of the few brands of diapers that my son doesn't leak out of overnight.
1,Don't Watch It / Don't Buy It,"Whether or not this movie is based on Kurt Cobain it is still the most boring and horrendous film I have ever seen. In fact, I could watch it all the wat through because nothing happened. Sorry Gus your career has gone out wirh a bang."
1,"Read Studs Terkle, ""The Good War,"" instead.","I tried to finish this homage to every WWII veteran Tom remembers from his distinguished journalistic career, but I couldn't. I got very tired of the author's ego interrupting the story these people told. This book is short on substance. I wanted to read more about their experiences and I felt the interviewer let a lot of good stories slip through his tape recorder. We are treated to a lot of boasting about how honest, hard-working and long-suffering this generation is. Clearly, there are other interviewers/writers who handle this same territory better. Studs Terkle comes to mind immediately. The generation Tom admires may indeed be the greatest. This book isn't."
1,Read This First!!!!!!!!!,okay people dont get this book! There is missing pages in it when ever some one reads a paper or document! save your money and get different one!
2,signal not very good,"i ended up not using it that often. great in the car, and near distance.however, compare to the cell phone signal, it has some low level noise.you can still continue the conversation, however..."
1,DocuMate 510 is Horrible,"This scanner is absolutely terrible. I have a small home business and I want to go paperless. If you are in the middle of a scan job, say you are on the 30th page already, and something is wrong, there is no recovery feature so you have to start from scratch. In fact, tech support says you will get constant errors if you scan more than 20 pages at a time, yet the document feeder is supposed to hold 50 pages (?). You can scan and then merge multiple scans to become one, but that is not the point. The point is that out of 900 pages of scanning, i got about two dozen errors which requires me to shut off the machine, close the scanning program and start all over again. I returned the product and got another documate 510 because tech support said it must be faulty, but the second is exactly the same. This scanner is nothing but a pain in the rear. I am shipping the second one back in the morning."
1,Terrible diapers,I purchased the next size up for my son for nighttime. I have never had a leak this badly before where it went up his chest and sides. I'm going to try the Huggies nighttime diapers.
1,A disappointment,"This is not a good atlas at all. Maps are small and you can't find many of the cities, let alone small towns in europe, at least in southeastern europe. Waste of money."
2,Capitalists create the context within which Americans wander,"According to Leach, corporations, academia and government have all worked to disengage Americans from their places of nurture so that Americans and indeed the whole world will travel, consume, and search continually for new things and experiences to buy. Upon reflection, I ask myself how Professor Leach convinced me that one-size-fits-all containers (for trains and trucks) supports his thesis."
1,Bodybuilder to Screen,Steve Reeves.The Hercules-Movies started Reeves' career and showcase him rather good.The digital quality is dabateble as well as the storyline. It's almost not worth the time it takes you to watch it.
2,Good Unit,"I've already dropped it, (unit was off) and it's fine. It's a little larger than I expected, so is more of a pocket unit than an armband or clip-on. The creative software is not too good - I did some searching and found some recommendations for Notmad Explorer - which does truly rock as accessory software for the Nomad. It will copy over playlists from most other media players without a hitch- which was problematic with the Creative application. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase."
1,"Ok, but definetly not great","This 2nd one is definetly not as good as the first one. I'm big into movies and always buy blu-ray, especially when it comes to animated stuff. Younger kids might like it just as much, but I didn't at all. I was kind of lost in the beginning trying to remember where the last one left off, so it would be a wise decision to watch the first one right before watching the second one. Wish they would have made it more exciting and better overall."
1,Never gets going,"This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written."
2,great,"I bought this at christmas time and i love it. i've yet to have a problem with it. i use staples brand computer paper and don't have a problem with it. the quality pictures it prints are excellent and fast. the only complaint i would have is that there is no tray to catch the papers that just printed out so they just basically fall down all over the place. i love the wireless connection to it. i have a laptop so i'm not always in the same place, but now i can sit in my bedroom and print something out and not have to fiddle with cords and such to connect it. i recommend this."
2,"Best batman movie hands down, Anxiously await release of the DVD and the Sequel","Batman Begins a new generation of Batman movies and if this movie is anything to go on the movies to come will be worth watching and buying. In this movie the as the title states shows the beginning of Batman from where Bruce Wayne was before to how he decided to use the bat and because ""Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies share my dread"" This movie shows the training that Bruce goes through to become batman. I think that Christain Bale (Equilibrium, Reign of Fire, American Psycho) is the best Batman to date, I believe that he will be in the next movie which is at this point untitled. But I eagerly await the release of the sequel"
2,If you love golf or just a great story,"What a book!!! Hard to believe you can break down one weekend and make it so fascinating! Made me want to go get a job at the USGA! What a great read, good flow, great humor but not over the top, good storyline, great characters...and it's all true!!!GREAT BOOK!!!"
1,Bronze,"I was not pleased, there were glue stains and rhinestones missing, but because I was pressed for time I had no choice but to keep them (they were to wear at my daughter's wedding."
2,Love My MP3,"I love this tiny MP3 player. Very easy to use. If you do have any problems, their customer support is great. I had to download a driver to get it going and I also called about another problem. They talked me right through everything and it all works well. I bought it primarly for the purpose of using a speaker system with it so I can listen to music in my office instead of depending on the radio. The earphoes included were not the best, so I did purchase another pair for improved comfort. I have loaded a video and some photos on it as well as music. To add videos and pictures it is necessary to dowload free software from the Sansa site. I feel this is a great product and it was better than I expected with a very reasoable price."
2,Set of four Free standing card holders,"Haven't had an opportunity to use them yet, but after examining them they appear to be a quality product , I'm sure they will be just fine and work as expected."
2,Amazing Asimov read !!!!!!,"I can't say enough about this book, weather you like SF or not this book is a MUST READ!!! It's more about people/civilizations/political systems than SF but either way I highly recommend it.As for SF it is simply the best SF book ever written!!!!"
2,A families point of view,"I went to high school with Robin and Julie. I can't drive over the Mississippi River without thinking about them. The newspaper articles, and TV interviews in St Louis were mainly focused on Tom's (the cousin) guilt, and these ""mystery 4 men"". I was glad to hear a book had been written from ""their"" point of view. When I say ""their"" I mean Robin and Julie. Robin and Julie are gone, and no longer have a voice for themselves, so Jeanine did the best she could to capture this horrible moment in time, and the aftermath it caused.I feel that as much hatred that she COULD have to the four men that murdered her cousins, and let her brother be blamed for the crimes, Jeanine was fair, and kind to the men. She did not make excuses for their actions, but she did explain how a fun night out, a decision to rob, could turn so dangerous and deadly in minutes."
1,Not Good,Have used this product before and was quite pleased with it so when I saw it on sale at Amazon I bought two bottles. Not sure if what I got was the real stuff or if it was grossly past the expiration date but it did not compare to what I had bought at the Molton Brown store before.I ended up throwing the stuff away and bought a new bottle directly from MB. I will never again buy this product on Amazon. I will buy from a MB store to make sure I get a quality product.
2,I love Tivo,I always wonderd about TIVO and now I wonderd how I ever lived without it. This product rocks.
1,Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing,"We bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas and I am very sorry we spent our money on it. Putting it together was not fun, but the real disappointment came when it was done and you see what it is. I think it is unrealistic to think that most people will want to or ever allow this toy to be STUCK to the wall with an adhesive (it says not to leave it stuck there for long periods of time - you must remove it from the wall after playing with it - which means this flimsy piece of plastic is now laying on the floor). After playing with it for 10 minutes, the elevator gets stuck. The top keeps falling off, everytime I turn around my son is whining that this came apart or that came apart. I assume I will be super gluing it before long. I feel ripped off as a consumer. Buyer Beware!"
2,"Touching, Heart-breaking!","Just a few words, if you have not read this book go get it now! This is one of those books written from the heart, that cannot- but have you in tears, truely written from the heart; it stired my soul! A true story of a young girl overcoming nightmares that we would not dread to imagine, it has truely opened my eyes, to the horror, that so many people lived through, and so many not....Well done Livia! A book that will live for an eternity!"
2,My favorite classic,"Anybody who enjoys a book should read and keep The Scarlet Letter in their library. It's a classic, must-own for anybody that values the concept of reading. And if you didn't like it the first time, read it again and give it a second chance. I've read it about six times and it gets better each time. Cherish this book."
1,Poor quality of wrapping,"I received my ""new"" product a few days ago but it wasn't in brand new conditions. The box had been worn around the edges and you can tell it had been rewrapped in a different plastic cover. When I pay extra money for a brand new item I expect it to be exactly that."
2,Awesome!,Just what I needed. Worked like a charm. Loved the various sizes. I suggest using an x-acto cutting mat underneath the leather. It'll get destroyed but it gives you a nice clean cut.
1,Worst diapers in the world,This was the worst diaper product we ever purchased. Store brands are far better than this popular product. Probably because it was on sale....Do not buy it if you care about your baby
2,A truly great horror movie,"I saw this film last night after refusing to see it for a while because of a fear of ventriloquism. What a great film! I sincerely believe that this is Anthony's Hopkins finest performance. His telepathic card scene with Ann Margaret is fantastic, he is just so intense. This is one of the most intelligent horror movies I've ever seen, because Fats never walks around on his own, when he murders victims, its done by Corky. Corky's obsession with perfection and success ultimately takes over his mind and ability to control himself. Metallica once did a song about this film called ""Sad but True,"" it sums up the ideology of this film well. I also believe this film's concept may have been based on that one Twilight Zone episode, but I could be mistaken."
2,My favorite movie of all time,"This is a screwballed comedy that delivers. Everyone can empathize with some the characters dilemmas. From the widowed character Cher plays that longs for a married life and almost ends up with the wrong guy, to the Mom (Olympia Dukakis) that looks for a single answer to a big question (Why do men chase women?). Every character plays both their practical side and their romantic side. This was the heart of the movie. We all opt for the practical, but hope for the romantic (moonstruck). I've seen this movie over ten times now and I never get sick of it. Especially, the final scene at the kitchen table."
1,Gimme a break,"This is ridiculously preachy stuff. I can tolerate a bit of leftiness in my folk, I find the sincerity touching, but this is too over the top to listen to all the way through more than once."
1,Not PCI Port,"I did not realize that I needed a PCI Port card and the web site did not indicate this requirement nor that this card was AGI. My son pointed it out to me after I ordered the card. When I contacted Tiger Direct, they did not know that it needed an AGI slot. They told me to call the Distributor - Diamond, who after a 35 minute wait on hold, said it was not his product (it was). When the card arrived and I confirmed that it was not PCI, I was able to return it and get a full refund. It was a hassle taking the box to be returned. I would have preferred to know about this before I ordered it."
2,Different,"I wasn't expecting what I got with this book. Rather than an all out zombiefest, this turned out to be more of a character study. I was really drawn into the story by the end though. I have a feeling you'll either love this book or hate it though."
2,Essential Bluegrass!,"Not only am I a fan of Dolly Parton, but a huge fan of bluegrass. Dolly has once again shown her versatility in delivering the essence of bluegrass, and adding so much more with her unique voice and harmonic orchestrations. This album is a buy whether you are a Bluegrass, Dolly Parton, or Folk listener.p.s. I'm still only halfway through my first listening of the album as I'm writing this!"
1,Feels like duct tape,"The baby dry diapers are terrible! I'm so glad I didn't buy them. I received them as a shower gift. They have a plastic duct tape feel to the top portion and they left my son's skin very moist. He literally had urine sitting on his skin when I opened his diaper. NOT my idea of a good diaper. I stick to Pampers Swaddlers or Pampers Cruisers, depending on which size you are using."
2,sanctuary second season,The season I received came from Amazon and was in excellent conditiion and on time. I enjoyed this season very much as I did not have to see the commericals. The extra were interesting
2,One Leg Willie highly reccomends this CD! Classic BLUES,"Hey, I've only got one leg, but that doesn't mean I don't know GREAT blues music when I hear it!!! I love Memphis Minnie and her rough and roudy vocals and rockin' guitar style, she is the epitime of the BLUES. She sings everything from jump blues, rockin' blues, delta blues to dirty blues. She has plenty of pep and energy, and sinsg liek there's no tomorrow. her delivery will hit you like an intoxicatingly wonderful tornado. You will love this cd, one Legged Willy promises, there you have it, THE ONE LEGGED WILLY GAURENTEE!!!Bottom Line: Just buy it, one legged Willy gives it the thumbs up!"
2,A Fun Read,"I didn't realize until I picked up this title at my local Borders that Sophie Kinsella wrote under another name - Madeleine Wickham. What a pleasant surprise!As a fan of the Shopaholic Series, and found this book to actually be more like Sophie's recent title - the Undomestic Goddess. The dialog was witty, yet believable. I found myself wanting to rush in and protect Candice from the evil Heather, comfort Roxanne during her loss, and tell Maggie that everything was going to be alright, and she would adjust to motherhood just fine. As a new mom, I could totally empathize with Maggie and her struggles!I can't wait to read more titles by Madeleine!"
2,helps in understanding children,"For a long time I have been discouraged in my efforts to establish two-way communication with children. I would bring books, toys, and games to social functions and share them with children. Once one activity was over, the children would stare at me, waiting for me to start another activity. Why won't they provide any input of their own? Am I overpowering them without realizing it?This book explained everything: the children think I'm a television!"
1,no two day delivery almost made for a diaper emergency,"I was expecting the usual prime 2 day delivery when I ordered this package of diapers over a week ago. I guess I have become so spoiled by Amazon's 2 day delivery that I just expected it to be here, and have been anxiously awaiting its arrival everyday until I had to breakdown and go to Target for diapers yesterday to avoid a complete crises....I will read the fine print next time or make sure I am getting the fast delivery schedule that I am expecting"
2,fantastic!,I love his voice. Clay always takes me there. I love every song and I can't wait for his next album.
1,Not really what I wanted,"For anybody who's looking for the 1978 movie with Lauren Bacall - this is not it ! Actually it's a 12 minute CBS music video by a group called ""Perfect Gentleman"" with 2 titles on it: ""Ooh la la"" and ""One more Chance"". This is not a rating of this video (I didn't bother watching it) but just of the fact that there's absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasn't the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it. That's even more a pity as it was the fastest delivery I ever got from the US to Europe by Mail - a very short-lived joy."
2,Pay attention to play list,"Almost all the songs on the soundtrack are great, but please be aware of the playlist difference of some of the reviews here, and what is actually on the cd. If you are looking for particular songs you may purchase the wrong cd if you go off the review."
1,Inadequate translation of a great novel,"This is an incomplete 1902 translation of Prus' classic historical novel, ""Pharaoh."" (It is missing the author's stunning Epilog, which was restored only later from the original manuscript.)The translator, Jeremiah Curtin, demonstrates an abysmally poor understanding of the original text's Polish language, and an equally poor grasp of English style. His primitive knowledge of the book's subject matter and his inept, wooden, inaccurate translation--it contains some real howlers--help explain the novel's limited appreciation, until recently, among English-language readers."
1,A very bad book.,"Not only was this book poorly written and boring, it teaches children bad moral values. It sympathizes with traitors and liars, and is highly unrealistic. I don't reccomend this book to anyone. This book was not sad or upsetting. The characters deserved what they got."
1,This toy is the WORST!,"This toy is the worst! You can't even get past the Password screen to play anything. I got tricked that it was a good toy, but it's not. And I don't want you to get tricked, either. I thought it was a good toy by looking at it in the wrapper, but it wasn't."
1,"Eh. With so much talent, they put out this?","Given the reputations of those involved, especially Shales, this is a hellacious disappointment and certainly not worth the hardcover price at any discount. They couldn't even get Murphy to talk to them and, given that he saved the show, that is a major problem in a book of this size and alleged scope. O'Donoghue, who was viciously brilliant, is reduced to a parody. There's nothing here you couldn't have figured out from reading years of tv commentary or watching the show."
2,"Very good, but...","Peter Turchin's ""Quantitative Analysis of Movement"" is the best (only?) available synthesis of techniques appropriate for analyzing movement patterns. Turchin addresses general concepts, techniques for measuring movements, movement models (mostly diffusion-based), techniques for analyzing movement paths, and mark-recapture techniques. Be aware, however, Turchin's analysis is more appropriate to displacement and redistribution questions and less suited for those interested in inferring motivation from movement trajectories.This is an intensely mathematical treatment, so be prepared. Turchin is kind enough to provide a special appendix, ""Diffusion for Ecologists,"" for those with relatively weak mathematical backgrounds (like myself). Not easy to understand but well worth the effort."
1,John Douglas Sold Out,"John Douglas sold himself out to the Ramseys. Acting as a paid consultant, he met with them and reviewed evidence and the crime scene. He criticizes colleagues and other law enforcement that believe the Ramseys are guilty. Mr Douglas did not work for the Boulder police or the D.A. so the evidence he reviewed was that which was made available by the Ramseys.If this isn't tainted, I don't know what is.The rest of the book rehashes old cases and does not offer any new information. It's a waste of time and money. Mr Douglas should be ashamed of himself for selling out."
2,supreme music...,"A Love Supreme might be one of the most recognized jazz recordings. You have to read the liner notes as it describes what Coltrane was going through at the time and his devotion to God. This is Coltrane's attempt to honor and praise God. It is an album of devotion with Coltrane at his best. McCoy Tyner plays piano, Jimmy Garrison, bass and Elvin Jones on drums. Haunting, powerful music."
1,Pass the Dramamine.,"Watching this, you just KNOW that important bits were edited out to protect the current reputation of Ms. Hurley. The ending just comes out of left field - adding to the impression that something was taken out. There are hints of a more than sisterly relationship between the two female leads but not enough to shore up the finale. The only saving grace is the price is right!"
2,Better than New,"I borrowed a copy of this book from a friend who said it only had 2 readings.When my ""used"" copy arrived through Amazon, it was like new, even betterthan my friend's. I am very pleased."
2,Sensible economic prognostications for a change!,"Lingle has again written a book far more valuable than its price.For those interested in Asia,and the econo-politics of the region, this is a must for any library, private or public. It is easily readable even for those not initiated in the arcane language of economics. His initial beliefs were manifested in the last year and a half."
1,Worst Book I have ever read,"This is like my first try at writing - over-used plot, short chapters, small vocabulary, typical charachters. This book shows no writing skills whatsoever. Look at its title. ""Jim the Boy"". Very original.Yet the dialogues freaked me out the most:""..."" Jim said""..."" Uncle Coran said""..."" said Jim""..."" Uncle Zeno said.The word ""said"" probably has the greatest number of synonyms, but Earley never used any other word.The plot is an ""oh so sweet"" typical plot that I have seen so many times. Nothing special. No twists to it. A plain, dull, stupid plot. Just another boy without a parent during Depression.I can't even say much about this book, because there's NOTHING in it. If I didn't have to read this book for my school, I would never have read it beyong the 20th page."
2,"rhythmic, textured, danceable electronic music","i love this music, but i can see how some people wouldn't. i guess reading through the reviews here says the same thing: this doesn't try to be the kind of music my mother would like (or some of my coworkers). but that must be obvious if you listen to the samples amazon provide.but otherwise, this is pretty sweet - it strikes a nice balance between playing with new ideas/sounds on the one hand and keeping a steady groove on the other. ""commerical experimental"" in a good way - and i think that's a very challenging target.as for the politics and trying to second guess whether this woman is ""for real"" - it doesn't matter unless you don't like the music. good music doesn't need to (and usually doesn't) match my politics. why on earth should it? if you don't like the music, fair enough. but to argue that you don't like music because of the attitude or the politics - what's with that? you're confusing music with something else, i think."
2,"tone starks, a poets art","I always loved Wu and Ghost, so i had to check this out, not knowing what to expect, cause Wallets was just aight. I was def impressed by this album. I saw the single with Missy and I thought Ghost went pop, but after hearin the whole thing, all can agree, this is HOT. Check out ""Metal Lungies"" and ""Run"" for some hot D-Block verses from Jada, Sheek, and SP. ""Holla"" is just Toney rhymin over an old Delfonics song, not sample, the whole song! I hear this song on the Muzak workin at Price Chopper, make me crack up. Hottest track on this album tho, for me at least, ""Be This Way"". Good sample, hot hot beats, some REAL lyrics from Ghost, good message. Like he says on the intro, new label, same Starks......and a HOT album."
1,Seriously suck,I bought these because I needed some diaper for when my daughter goes to great grandmas (or else my cloth diapers end up in the trash...) and they LEAKED EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Granted my daughter is a heavy wetter but these say 12 hours!!!! And they smell HORRID!!!! The poo went everywhere. I have NEVER had a leak in my cloth diapers. NEVER. 7 months so I was just used to packing her diapers and not spare clothes so I had to come home from work to get her. Last time I EVER use Pampers again. Everyone told me they were great. YEAH RIGHT!!! I wish I could give them a zero.
2,TrÃ©s Bien CÃ©line,"The new CD by Celine Dion is really good. The French lyrics add a sweet touch to the ear, and each song is exquisite and unique. Tout l'or des hommes is unique in its hard rock theme. Apprends-moi seems a bit too pop ballady. My favorite on the album, Le vol d'un ange, is a emotionally touching and a beautiful-tuned song. Je lui dirai is very funky, and Ne bouge pas is hilarious. Get the CD!"
1,Nowhere near Simpsons highlights,"Unfortunately these episodes date from the first 2 series, which were nowhere near as clever, inventive, subtle and hysterical as the later episodes. I really wouldn't bracket any of these as SImpsons classics, having seen maybe 200 episodes. 2 Cars In Every Garage is probably the best, marking the first appearance of a 3-eyed fish (a great insight into the surreal humour of the show's authors). Treehouse Of Horror was stylish and also very surreal, especially the first part. Bart Vs Thanksgiving, and Bart gets an F to an extent, falls into the pigeonhole of early episodes characterised by Bart doing somethig 'bad' (and personally I prefer seeing Homer be stupid) and neither are all that engaging, otehr than the superbly constructed Snow Day scenes. I wouldn't bother with this one."
2,One of the first Christian non-glam Metal bands,"This album is pretty good, but as for Roger's new direction, he is now an atheist with a severe hatred for the Christianity he once preached. Which brings up the question of was he ever truly saved at all. And if he wasn't can this album truly be considered Christian? Some thoughts to wrestle with... On a strictly musical review this and Once Dead are great albums but after Roger kicked out, or had a falling out with the other band members the music suffered. If the pauses were taken out between the songs on Destruction Comes, (In which Roger plays all of the guitars as well as sings) you would seriously think it is all one long song. pretty sad."
1,Conventional Wisdom for Morons,"This book is simply a compilation of repackaged material that anyone with common sense could write down on a piece of paper. The anecdotes are hokey and the BOLD ALL CAPS punch lines are simply there to take up space. Save yourself some money by sitting down and taking the time to think of how to package yourself in your job search. Also, Mr. Lucht makes sure that his self promotion is woven throughout the book. The kicker is that the book is simplisticly and exasperatingly written in a kind of folksy style. My advice: find someone that you or one of your friends knows who has changed careers, take them out to lunch and pick their brain."
2,"Will take a 15.5"" laptop","I have an XPS GEN 2 Inspiron which is 15.5"" long. I had an older version of this backpack that the XPS would just fit into snugly but, alas, the zipper teeth eventually broke off. I was concerned that this backpack might be too small and after first slipping the laptop in... it didn't. But I discovered that theres a removable cushion liner at the bottom of the laptop slot (attached with Velcro), removing that gave me an extra half an inch and voila, the laptop fits (albeit snugly again). The laptop isn't completely unprotected at the bottom, there's a hard plastic shell there as well and the snug fit keeps the laptop from sliding around. 15.5"" is max though...those with a larger laptop (say the newer 16"" wide Dell XPS latops) will probably want to seek another backpack."
1,I should like it but I don't,"I would like to think that I am always supportive of Australian talent, but in this case I am not. This book is highly impractical in the main. I mean really, who could devote 7 days to working on a magickal new self. It's a lovely idea, but just so self-centred. The amount of money you would have to spend to fossick around for all the bits and pieces she says you need, urgh you'd need a lie down after that. Ok so she sort of redeems herself at the end with a small section on what to do if you don't have the time, but it's a token chapter.The other thing is that most of the text appears to have been borrowed form her other publications, and the picture on the front, whilst very cutesy, she is a pretty lass after all, is a real-turn off to a serious Wiccan practitioner.Sorry Fiona, not a great buy or unique read."
1,Not That Good,"I gave this cd 2 stars and I was very generous. Clay has alot of things to be thankful for, mainly the vicious hatred of Ruben which translates into super stardom for him. Just today this runner up had a sandwich named after him at a local restaurant. If Clay was just a young artist just starting out and there was none of this controversy, there is no way this cd would have gone double platinum. I do like the single invisible, but it is not good enough to carry the entire cd. He needs more depth to his voice and to learn that he does not have to scream on every song. These songs are a collection of mushy love songs one blending into the other.I wonder how he feels knowing that it is not his talent that has sent his career sky rocketing, but a very generous case of affirmative action. Anyway he will get richer while we all continue to hate."
1,zero star,those guys ARE OVERATED!! ARE THEY REALLY FUNNY? NOPE. STUDIOS PAY THEM MILLIONS OF DLSS FOR THIS!!! C'MON AMERICA.. WAKE UP!!!
1,Read it only for school,"I had to read this book for school, and I really didn't like it. There were good parts, but there was a lot of wasted words in other parts. I was very surprised that some of the bad events were in great detail and the ok parts were not. I hated the bad parts because they were so disgusting to read. I am only 12 and I think this book is better for mature readers. This book had a great theme, but a lot of the not so important events could have been taken out. If you are a mature reader and like science fiction, you will probably like this book."
1,Outdated and misleading code examples,"If you are a designer who wants to know how to customize Plone's look beyond changing colors and fonts, you'll be disappointed in this book. Sure, the introduction is still good, but chapter 6 (for example), which instructs you to work with the Plone Base Properties file is giving you an outdated method, not well suited to upgrades and maintenance. I believe that stylesheets are the way to go, now...but I'm still trying to figure it out, no thanks to this book. The instructions for adding slots in Chapter 5 were just impossible to follow and did not even vaguely work. Yes, the text is in English, but the descriptions bear little resemblence to the Plone 2.1+ experience.This book will, however, give a somewhat glossy overview of the entire application. I would get a recent version of Andy McKay's book, and look elsewhere for customization help."
2,Great for Kids,"This should be considered a toy and not your only set of Ipod or MP3 speakers. The kids love to play with the sounds and listen to IZ's crude sounds along with their music. However, you can forget about listening to audio books. This would have been a really great product if you could just turn off the sound effects when you want to."
1,Worst costumer service ever!!!!!!!! size runs small,"My baby isn't 17lbs yet and these diapers were too small for her, and they say it is for 16 to 28 lbs. Plus, even though my baby sleeps through the night , when I used this diaper, she woke up at 2:30am all WEAT. I called the Pampers costumer service and they offered me a $5 coupom...........yes, I could not believe it, at last they offered a $10 coupom, so I'll still need to spend monwy on it? I hopped to have at least a size 4 sent to me. Be carefull, those diapers can work for you, but be concious that whenever you need the costumer service they will not replace the diapers.Not buying Pampers agin........by the way, seventh generation and Huggies are far better!Viviane"
1,Not at all good,"This book is filled with recipes using brand-name adulterated products that contain large amounts of additives, preservatives, artificial flavors, colors, trans-fats, bland flavors and also cost a lot more then scratch foods.If you believe boiling potatoes, using fresh vegetables or measuring flour unthinkable, by all means this book is right up your alley...."
2,refreshing!,"It took me a few times before I could honestly give this CD a five star rating, but it is worth it. Clay is so refreshing and is filling a music void. I hope he will continue on and reach his potential as a singer. We could use a few more like him."
1,Failed after 6 months,Purchased this radiator 5 months ago. It fit perfectly and performed well for 5 months. The side tank seam started weeping last week. This week it is leaking a lot. I expected this to last much longer. I will purchase another brand next time or go to a junk yard and get one from there.
2,"The best Deal among net, brick & mortar","The cheapest way you can buy baby diapers, and you don't have to sweat it, it will come to your front door. Baby diaper shopping nirvana."
1,"A very, very cheap rip off of predators. Only missing a few things. I say D","""If these guys can't fix it, Hell no one can."" After a group of scientists goes missing, the army hires an elite covert team led by Tyler (Sorbo) to go and investigate and rescue them. When they get to the site they discover something they never could have imagined. There really is not much to say about this movie. The best way to explain it is that this is a Scy/Fy channel version of ""Predators"". It is only missing the effects, action, cool bad guys and acting, other then that it is a lot like ""Predators"". If you are a HUGE Predator or Sci-fi fan you would probebly like this, otherwise go ahead and aviod this and anyone who wants you to watch it. I give it a D.Would I watch again? - No way! I will not be getting this for my store.*Also try - Predators"
2,Getting tired??,"I mean it's good, but when I put it next to the blistering first two releases, this is definitely in third place. When bands start doing covers of Deringer's rock N roll hoochie coo it's either a lack of new materiel or a shift in direction. Me thinks this is Blaine's Dixie fried influences coming through! Thought the pussy intro was a bit juvenile too. All that being said, most of the album still kicks butt! Like all previous comments, they were a blast to see live - - my ears whined for days thanks to a front row pearch in front of rock goddess Ruyter and her Marshall stack. All in all a good guitar rock album, just not as good as the previous ones!"
2,Good kids book!,"We just got this book and again it is great. Diane Layton does a great job speaking to little ones about something so very serious and making it understandable. I have loved everyone of her books that we have received. They are wonderful, I wish there were more books like these!"
1,Very dissapointing,"I've just received it as a persent for my birthday amongst another 8 or 10 CDs. At first it caught my eye better than any of the rest, but I feel very dissapointed because of the (almost all) live recordings, which I don't expect in a collection named ""Greatest Hits"". The saddest part is that it sinks all my interest in Pete Seeger for quite a while.Those who know the artist well, what would recommend me to re-start?"
1,Almost dangerous,I used these as candle warmers rather than coffee mug warmers. I bought 5 of these and would turn them on probably 15-20 minutes at a time. They ended up almost exploding or busting open after a while and exposed the insides. It scared me. One of them just stopped working altogether. I'm completely disappointed with this product.
1,Uses yellow ink,"I would not buy this printer again. It quickly uses up all the yellow ink. This is a common problem with this printer. See Yahoo Answers, search for ""hp photosmart yellow"". I think they should be recalled."
1,Shuffled?,This item did not work very long. I made a call and it was replaced but that one did not work either. Just quit with it. Wish someone could design a shuffler that would WORK! It's a great idea.
1,Zzzz...,"In my opinion, the worst book in the series. I read this book through just because I did not want to waste my spent money.do only buy it if you are a HARDCORE Discworld Fan."
1,Not enough information. Cap did not fit my model.,"The item was not fully described. I thought it would fit my Rebel camera,however it did not.Nor"
2,"Too, too cute.","Very humorous, although I would have liked a little more between the sheets. Okay plot, but the characters were likable enough for me to recommend it for a ""quick"" read. Also, let me recommend one I just finished, The Color of Revenge. Hot, hot, hot!"
2,Great Game for Young Kids,My kids ages 5 (boy) and 8 (girl) love this game! They are obsessed... It is the one that has been able to keep their attention more than any other so far.
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"This has to be one of the worst books i EVER picked up. Within the fist 50 pages, iwas bored out of my mind. I don't know why everyone think this book is SOOOOO good, don't listen to them. If you like BAD books this is the one for you! I hope Asimov has some better books, cause he has to be acclaimed a good writer for something (or book)!"
2,Action Pack Series Going To Extreme!,The package came inmediately and in good conditions. Series have becomes more action pack that before. Showed lots of new superheroes and how they'll be attach to Superman. AWESOME!!
1,Doesn't have any information,This book doesn't have any information for the dummy in the astronomy. The book is more like a museum guide to the starts. The information on this book is nothing new and it doesn't teach you about telescopes or related topics.
2,IT'S COOL BUT,I THINK THIS ALBUM IS COOL BUT THERE FIRST ONE WAS WAY METAL. IT KIND OF MAKES ME MAD THAT NO ONE CARES ABOUT THERE FIRST CD AND MANY PEOPLE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT AND ITS THERE BEST ONE.
2,Must for Buffy fans!,"This collection episodes is great for Buffy fans, or people who have no idea what Buffy is. This video is what the show is all about. Humor, drama, sorrow, love, friendship, etc. is all in these two episodes. ""Angel"" describes the relationship between Buffy and Angel, and gives viewers a look into his life. ""The Puppet Show"" may give off a creepy vibe, but it's one of the episodes I laugh at everytime I watch it, it's so funny. If you haven't seen these episodes, or even if you have, you should get this video!"
2,reads like a novel,"...because it is a novel. Kingsley started going off the deep end with this one, but as long as you remind yourself that this is just a story he is telling, a story from within him that actually has very little to do with Plato and Parmenides but only one guy's vision of them as characters in a book, it is actually a charming little thing to read. It may be literature and it may be mysticism but philosophy it ain't."
2,"Acting, Screenplay, and Setting Make Moonstruck a Classic","""Moonstruck"" is one of the best movies of the past 20 years. The plot is corny, but superb writing makes it seem natural and enjoyable. Excellent acting by Nicholas Cage, Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, and Cher (believe it or not). Filmed in some very picturesque NYC locations. It all adds up to a movie you can enjoy more than once."
2,Cannon battery,Not much to say it was a true Cannon battery not a generic battery which don't seem to last as long. I had bought generics before and had problems with them retaining the charge after a while. It's worth the cost to have an actual Cannon product. It was sent promptly and it works
2,Get out your roller skates!,"This is one of my favorite CDs that I've heard in the last year. If you don't end up loving it, you're at least guaranteed to think it's pretty funny.This is just one of those records you can't really intellectualize. You hear it, you love it or you hate it. It's all about fun fun fun and, for me, took no work at all to enjoy or ""get into"".For the late 90's, this was a very bold album to produce. So much pressure is put on electronic artists to sound absolutely new and completely groundbreaking, and this record isn't only tinged with 80's influences-- it often sounds like it was made IN the 80's.Most of these tracks are wonderful, I only find two to be unlistenable ""Soft Machine"" and ""From: Disco To: Disco"". The second to last, ""Sometimes"" is one of the most-played songs in my apartment.Get this CD!"
2,My Favorite Shakespeare,"The language wraps you up and transports you to a time and land like no other. It's full of love, hate, brutality, and loyalty. All these emotions get tangled up and mixed together. That lends itself to an amazing set of circumstances. There is no greater love story than Juliet and her fair Romeo. All other love stories are measured against this one and you will get lost in this classics story. It's a true classic."
2,Fun for Tots and Preschoolers,"We just got this for our 2 1/2 year old and 4 1/2 year old. They love it. The 2 year old is a little scared but he will play sometimes and he really likes to watch. The 4 year old loves it, especially if you make your reaction to the gater bites dramatic."
2,A Princess of Barsoom,"""I have never told this story nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until I have passed over for eternity. I know that the average human mind will not believe what it can not grasp......""Written in 1912 this book is well written for its time and has intrigued countless generations of readers. I get the feeling that this story is being told over a campfire.Captain Carter is telling the story form memory as an old man of his adventures here on earth and on the planet of Barsoom (Mars). There are encounters with many strange creatures, situations, and yes even a ""Princess of Mars."" The forward to the book alone will capture your imagination.John Carpenter states ""In one respect at least the Martians ae happy people; they have no lawers.""This is a part is a series by the writer that brought us ""Tarzan."" The intro to the book alone will capture your imagination.The Great Book of Tarzan"
2,I loved the first half,"I was held completely enthralled through the first half of this book. i loved the setting and it's description. I loved the heroine and the 'wee lad' she took under her wing. My only problems with it were that, for me, there weren't enough love scenes, and they arrived too late in the story...and the fact the author decided to throw in another couple into the mix, without fully fleshing out their story. I think Ms. Garwood should have stuck to her main protagonists and left the other couple for another book"
1,"If Hell wants Keanu Reeves, let it have him and this stupid film.","Dumb, very dumb supernatural thriller that lacks a lot of brains and a credible leading man. Keanu Reeves literally sucks this movie dried with his lack of talent and makes every thing about the movie into a very bad and cruel joke. The director can't even stage a scene with tension and some parts of the movie are very dark to even see what is happening from time to time. The script is horrible with some of the worse dialog imaginable and the special effects are pretty bad. The only thing that this movie has going for it is the performances of Rachel Weisz, who gives the movie more class and dignity that it does not deserve and Peter Stormare, who does more with his small role than Keanu does with his main character.If it were not for Weisz and Stormare, I probably would have walked right out of the theater, that's how bad the rest of the movie was."
2,"Nice program, and you get two Tone Poems","If all you have is the symphonies, this is a nice start to sample Sibelius. The Swan of Tuonela is just one part of a set of four, but the VÃ¤nskÃ¤ version, along with JÃ¤rvi, is one of my favorites.Buy the disc used, there are usually many copies. I got one and it was autographed!"
1,Broke!,"This worked well for about 4 months and then broke. Its mechanism turns to ""warm"" now way before the rice is done. When I called the company to ask about service or an exchange, I got someone one time. I had to call back with more information from the receipt and I have never been able to get a hold of someone since then. I have called about 8 other times. It is not worth my time to keep trying to get a hold of someone, pay to send it to a service person, etc. Since this item is well reviewed in Cook's Illustrated, I am debating buying another and crossing my fingers..."
2,Good 3rd installment,"This is a little longer and more detailed than the first two books in the series. However, I have enjoyed each new aspect of the exciting fantasy universe."
2,great,"bought it for my heels, great my fiancee loves it, hope to buy a few more, it keeps the heels very soft."
2,Belleza,"Como su tÃ­tulo lo dice, el libro es una belleza. Excelentes ilustraciones. La revisiÃ³n histÃ³rica de la belleza es de gran valor."
1,i hated this movie,"I had the misfortune of paying my hard earned allowance on this movie. It was so pitiful I had to walk out before the half way point. How did I know it was the half way point? Easy I was checking my watch every 2 minutes. The plot was so thin and cliched...Oooh I wonder if she is gonna make it as a star? .... It was horrible, it was a waste of money and resources, if you want to save the environment, make sure movies like these don't get made. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie, if you want a good romantic story this is not the place to find it. There are so many other good movies for you to watch. I don't have a personal thing about it, but it upset me so much I had to tell the world. Please, please, please don't watch this movie and if you know someone who liked this trash then slap them upside their head, they deserve it and perhaps need some kind of shock therapy as well."
2,WOW! A MUST HAVE!,"This album is incredible! It has been too, too long since an album has been made that is packed with all #1 hits. Clay Aiken's Measure of a Man will revolutionize the music industry. His pure, amazing voice is brethtaking. This album is a definite MUST for all Music Lovers of all ages."
1,Almost Useless,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE AMAZON KINDLE EDITIONNot worth having. The work is not scanned in properly. It lacks a hyperlinked table of contents. SO if you want to find ""A Man with a Maid"" you have to click through all the pages between here and there to get to it. That sort of spoils the moment so to speak.Heck the table of contentsR e a d s l i k e t h i sHow hard is it to do the job right?This publication detracts from the Kindle's reputation. Amazon ought to withdraw it."
1,JUNK,MY SON SAW THE NEW TV SHOW AND WANTED THE NEW BATCAVE. HE HAD THE ORIGINAL ONE BUT BOTH HIM AND I WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE SIZE. DO NOT LET THIS FOOL YOU. IT IS BUILT VERY FLIMSY. THE PARTS FALL APART EASILY. THE ELEVATOR CANNOT BE USED UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PROPER BATMAN DOLLS TO PUT IN THERE . THE CARDBOARD BACKING FALLS OFF. THE STICKERS ARE A PAIN TO PUT ON. I SPENT 2 HRS ON X-MAS EVE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CAVE. MY SON HAS IT STUCK IN A CORNER. HE HAS MORE FUN LINING UP HIS ACTION FIGURES ON THE COUCH AND USING HIS IMIGINATION THAN THIS TOY. DO NOT GET IT. THE ORIGINAL BATCAVE IS BETTER. SMALLER BUT BETTER.
2,solid value,"I might not want to nap on it myself, but my 2 year old loves it. Good quality and a fair price."
1,Not worth all that money,"The content does not simulate the actual USMLE and there are so many nagatively phrased questions and also, most of the questions are never asked as for as my step1 experience goes."
2,"Open minded german ""metal""?","With Heiland, Schweissers fourth album, the band takes a big step outside their metal-hardcore image. Most of the tracks show a wider range of styles, taking the very intense lyrics to an even higher level. All of the songs have a very good live feeling, always with an eye on the right groove (and who wants to bang his head to the same rhytm for a two hour show?) Knowing their new work ""..bitte warten"" (please wait) this was the needed link in between. Highlights are: Heiland, Meine Liebe ist ein Monster (featuring Apocalyptica), Friss Scheisse and Nachrechnen."
2,Subtle and nearly spiritual; classic scifi epic.,"While similar in premise to some of his other tales of worldshaking technological demigods, this book has some additional moral elements. Zelazny offers them plainly, evoking a feeling of religious historicism that makes some of the shinier platitudes more appropriate. He achieves this with decorous dialogue and a marvelous and nearly timeless portrayal of technological 'miracles' that are unfathomable to the hairy-knuckled masses. The sympathetic and chain-smoking antihero is also present, driving the archetypical story along a delineated route of demon-dealing and decadence. Zelazny's wordcraft is excellent, and this book should be well received by all but the most technophiliac of science fiction connoisseurs."
2,THE BOOK HAD A GOOD CONCEPT BUT I COULDNT GET THE PHRASING,"THE BOOK WAS GREAT IN THE WAY THAT IT WARNED US OF A FUTURE THAT COULD COME SOON, BUT FOR YOUNGER READERS THEY MAY HAVE A HARD TIME WITH ALL THE METAPHORS THAT HE THROWS IN THERE."
1,"Soft, cute designs, but leaks","The Pampers Baby Dry diapers seem to be leaking often even after a new diaper has been put on. I changed my son's diaper and it leaked within 15 minutes on 2 occasions. They seem to fit him well and are soft and cute, but somehow aren't effective. I'm sure that it's like many products. They work extremly well for some, but for others, the product does not work."
1,Memory Lane??,"I bought 2 of these hoping to show my kids one of the toys I had growing up. Wow, these are straight CRAP. Why would someone produce a product that SUCKS this much?!! The clip that holds the rocket to the pump doesn't hold the rocket on. The O-ring is a dried, hard, brittle piece that doesn't seal. Then, when you get past ALL that crappy-ness, the pump shaft will either pull completely out, bend like a pretzel while pumping, or leak water into the pump itself! I got three launches out of 2 of these. I was more disappointed than the kids were. Boooooo!"
2,Lord of The Wu Tang,"Basically the story is about 2 swords, 1 contains (inside the sword) the instructions for the most powerful kung fu, the other contains instructions how to lead an army and become China's emperor.But on one knows this secret. Everyone thinks these are magical swords and would give their owners invicibility.So the fight begins for the 2 swords...This is story a bit confusing, purely because the original story is over 3000 (3 thousand pages) long.What makes it even more confusing is this story is a sequel to another 3000 pages Kung Fu story.So to try and compress 6000 pages to a couple of hours on DVD would confuse any viewer unless you already know the story !Anyway, this is the best Kung Fu story ever. It was first published on a HK news paper in the 1960s.Most Asian males should know this story !"
1,1 star is too many for this book,"This is an insipid, uninspired, pointless, maudlin, unprovocative, boring, and poorly written travesty that never would have been published if the author hadn't been famous. Save your money. (It might be useful for insomniacs, I must admit.)"
1,Not worth your money,"This game is ridiculously hard for a game with ""Nickelodeon"" on it. I was expecting something easy that my 5 yr old would like to play. Spongebob and Tommy let us down. Hard. Very little point to the game on multiplayer, some of the levels I (a gamer of many years) can not figure out the moves to and in the end the case makes a great coaster. My daughter is a much bigger fan of Cel Damage and Rayman Arena. XBox needs more kids games, but this one was a waste of money. I won't be taken in by the ""Nickelodeon"" name again."
2,LOVE IT,"I am a thirty-six year old female, and never thought I will love rock..But I must admitt I was wrong...I love these guys.Toxicity is awesome !Love youSerj"
2,Lost Boy offers hope,"This award winning documentary was brilliantly produced and directed. But more importantly, Greg's story is a true example of God's redeeming love, grace, healing and mercy. I worshiped at Greg's church years ago and have kept up with him over the years and marvel at the anointed power of his messages. When I heard this story for the first time I had no idea his life had been so difficult growing up. To see what the Lord did for this broken, lost little boy is a magnificent testimony to His colossal love for us. Greg has been tested on the anvil of adversity, and his story has profoundly affected my life and faith. As powerful as his ministry was before, it is even more so now. When I go through difficult times, sometimes his story comes to me and I say, ""There is hope indeed. God will get me through this.This DVD is a powerful tool for evangelizing. Glory to God for His all consuming love that gives us such hope."
1,Too tiny even for a tiny girl.,"I am 5'3"" and weigh 100lbs and have very tiny hands and wrists. These weights are so tiny, and they barely stretch, so I can hardly even get them on my wrists. Plus, the 1 lb weight is not nearly enough for me."
2,Aerobed saves the day (and night) with comfortable sleep alternative!,"I ordered the aerobed for visiting guests, and they loved it. Also, it fit nicely in my space-challenged unit. Shipping was great! Price was great! all happy campers."
2,excellet,"this is what movies are all about, to Be enjoy...a great movie, of suspence based on a greata comic book, for the ones who said the movie sucked,STAY HOME AND READ A BOOK!! dont go out Its bad for you.Peace."
1,Buyer Beware,"I decided to get a new printer for picture reproduction and small business projects. The printer shredded 40% of the print jobs I sent. The roller jams the paper in back, forcing you to remove a panel and ripping the sheet from the teeth of this monster. It is like playing toy-tug with my dog. If it does not eat your print jobs, then the sheet is fed in cockeyed and it prints off kilter when a lucky sheet makes it out of this beast. I was very dissapointed after only one week of ownership"
2,"Hard hitting, indenpendent cinematography, at it's finest!","This has got to be one of the best films i have been priveleged to see in a long time. The realism is just insane coming from such young actors. they just didn't play the part, they were it. There's moments in this masterpiece that you flat out forget you're watching a screen. a must see for anyone who likes good cinema."
1,Please make it stop!!!,"I'm sorry but Ray J can't sing worth a damn. Everytime ""One Wish"" comes on the radio I have to change the station - it's too painful to listen to. I can't believe they let that one get past the studio...please make it stop!!"
2,Works very well,Planters warts on the feet are uncomfortable and difficult to treat. This wart stick makes it easy to apply the medicine exactly were you need it.
2,Babe: Enough said.,"One of the best baseball legend biographies I've read. It moved quickly, but thoroughly...a very enjoyable read. Although the term ""page-turner"" is clichÃ©, that's what this is."
2,Not for the simple minded and/or immature,"A certain mental maturity is needed to appreciate this book. It is useless to prescribe it to silly bobby-socksers whose minds and interests can't go beyond TV shows about spoiled teenagers and/or Most-Popular-Boy-on-Whatyamacallit-School-Team. Go back to your Barbies, nitwits: you'll never be able TO READ."
1,Irwin Utility Knife,"The fixed unit is ok, but a folding utility knife is better. The sliding unit is junk. The blade does not stay in the knife. Easy to change the blade, but who cares if the blade won't stay put."
2,Helpful,I purchased this book because I was writing a novel about the Native Americans who lived in the Finger Lake region f New York State. The book was helpful as far as gaining some insights into the life styles of these people. I really was not reading this book for its entertainment value.
2,Good diapers,"All in all, I like these diapers. My daughter wore the size 4 Baby Dry diapers and I decided to switch to the bigger ones. My daughter's weight is 26 lbs and the size 4 was just too small for her. As she started gaining more weight she began growing out of these diapers because later on she started having leaks from the diaper at night. I decided to go with the bigger size 5 and that it should be better. Well they are great because they are bigger, but the problem is that they are too big. There's space between her body and the middle of the diaper. So when she pees, at times the pee just comes out on the side instead of the diaper. The connection between the body and diaper is not good. I'm sure when she gains more weight the diapers will be great again. Overall I like these diapers a lot."
2,Such an accurate delight!,Talk about reviewing our roots. I'm the same age as Tom and from S.D. so it was a pleasure to revisit my childhood.
1,Watch it only at gunpoint because it's really bad.,"Mediocre Matrix rip off with a twist finds poor Keanu Reeves trying to rip off his own series with a supernatural tale that has one bad clichÃ© after the next and doing a really bad job on top of that.. The director barely scrapes by with the bad script that everybody had to work with and the special effects are sub par for a movie of this size. I agree with the majority who wrote that only Rachel Weisz is fine here with a better than this film deserved performance but other than her effort, the movie just is not worth your time.Avoid."
2,"El libro mas completo que existe para nosotras,","las m,ujeres embarazadas o por embarazarnos...LO ABARCA TODO, DESDE LA CONCEPCION HASTA QUE EL BEBE CUMPLE UN AÃ‘O...Dulce, sabio y ameno..."
1,Terrible diapers,"This baby dry diaper is supposed to be used for longer duration at nights. Out of the 5 diapers I have used, the gel balls from 2 of them burst and spread all over the house. I have been using the pampers swaddlers and the pampers cruisers but never had issues with them. I will never buy the pampers "" baby dry"" diapers again."
1,Hollywood has run out of ideas......,"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't stay awake to see this complete video. Whenever a cliche' scare comes up, I fall asleep....and this was often. I saw the original 60's version and, sorry, but that one was a snoozer too. I think this story could be phenomenally scary, but the right party has yet to make it.The only really scary thing about this movie is looking like Lily Taylor and having to share the screen with Catherine Zeta-Jones. She's a Goddess!!"
2,Looking forward to reading other books by this author,This book was so fascinating that I could not take a break from reading it. I look forward to reading Dr. Han's books The Secret Life of Quanta and The Probably Universe.
1,ZZZZZZZZZZ,I've got one word for you: BORING! Just the thought of reading several sequels to this snooze-fest is enough to make me drowsy.
2,Enjoyable novel,"This was the first Xanth novel I ever read, but it was easy enough to get into. I wasn't too confused by reference to other Xanth novels as they were minimal and were not much focused on. Some of the jokes were rather funny, and the plot had enough humorous twists in it (and a couple of cool surprises!) to keep me well-entertained. It was a rather enjoyable book, though I definitely like Incarnations of Immortality better. overall 3.5/5 stars."
2,Impressive!,"I have attended Kremata Baltica's concert in Hong Kong performing exactly the same programme. I was already impressed by the performance of the enesemble for Baltica young musicians and under the direction of Gidon Kremer that night. Now the CD is still impressive. It is not easy to get impressed by contemporary music for me as an ordinary classical music lover, but Piazzolla's music is not pretending to be profound and difficult. It's new music technique does not prevent his expression and comminucation of emotions via his music to the audiences. The combination of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons & Piazzolla's The Four Seasons in Buenos Aires is a fantastic mix as well."
2,Zen Garden,"My Zen Garden came on time and exactly as described. I like it, but it really only is a tray with sand. Get this product if you want a nice Zen garden. If you want to have something to help you relax, get something else, there are better ways to cut loose."
1,"Does not work properly, COMPANY NO HELP","The DVD maker is easy to setup but the one I have doesn't work properly. While converting: I am getting interference from the unit on both the TV and computer (which shows up on the copy), there is a 1/8 inch distortion at the bottom of the preview screen (also shows up on the copy), and the sound is not in sync. I tried to contact the company by phone and left messages instructed with no call back from them. Sent an email to tech support that went unanswered too. Finally contacted someone at the company, explained my problems, returned the unit as per instructions for repair, received it back after 3 weeks and it still doesn't work. Contacted tec support again and was told to download updated program(I had the latest version installed) did so anyway without any better results. My suggestion is to pass on this unit."
1,Painful!,"Painfully, painfully, painfully bad! At first it's just the bad writing and the stock cardboard characters. If you're looking for psychological nuance or complexity, don't open this book. Thank God the author spared us the love scenes! But by the time the secrets are revealed, the book has descended into a comic awfulness reserved for only the greatest bad books. I was writhing and groaning on my couch. If your book club is used to reading good books, have them read this one sometime, and then sit around like the guys in Mystery Science Theater and have a great time poking fun at it. But hey, it was a best seller! Says a lot about us doesn't it?!"
2,lives up to its reported reputation,"purchased for two reasons: first, for a video presentation (connect to computer and speakers); second, for playing music at home and on the go. it works fine and is a great value for the money. buyer's remorses - would like a similar sized and quality product that has a remote control and bass/treble features"
2,Fragile,"This toy broke within the first two minutes that I took it out of the box. My son is 4 years old and has had most of his toys for a long time and is not particulary destructive, so I was surprised after reading all the reviews for it- how great it was-- you could imagine my disapointment. I do not give this toy a favorble reccomendation."
1,Disturbing,"Although the images are very well rendered, they arefrightening. I am baffled about the impression this book is supposedto leave on children. This book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale, when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of WWII in Berlin. The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreig's big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy. This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers. I can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher."
1,wrong category !,"This is not a book about climbing - which I found kinda funny for a book about mt. Everest; this book is about ms. Gammelgaard proving to herself ""she could be the first nordic woman to set foot"" on Chomolungma - big deal ! So maybe you can call this a tale of a driven, achieving lady who singlemindedly pursues a goal, but you will learn nothing about what happened in may, 1996 or about what being on mt. Everest is like; not even close to Krakauer's or Boukreev's books on the same topic: buy those instead."
1,lukewarm,"I do not like my coffee HOT, but the coffee cup warmer I had for almost 30 years kept it at a very nice warm temperature. This one is barely lukewarm, and I do not have a very thick mug, which I am sure the heat would not penetrate at all. Don't waste your money."
2,The cooked rice smells good to heaven,"It's really my pleasure to cook with this rice cooker. I always set the cook time as 6:30AM, the tasty smell just sweetened my dream, I love it.I rank it as the best rice cooker ever in the world, I marketed this product to all my friends, it worth of the money if they knew how beautiful the rice is cooked.I am very critical on food, but this rice cooker just broke me down, I don't have any negative words on it. O...hold on....there IS ONE - the price.I can use it forever, and will buy a bigger one when I got married.Jessica Liu"
2,Decent 1985 Debut for this british group.,"Like the last reviewer stated, the REALLY good songs on this album are ""R.S.V.P."", ""Let Me Be The One"", ""Hide and Seek"", ""Love Take Over"", ""All Fall Down"", & ""System Addict"". As for all the rest, ok, to boring. I honestly skip all the rest of the songs. Other than that, this album is a classic!"
2,Very good,"Here you'll find Elton John's music transcribed down to a tee. This is a welcome change to nonsensical 'interpretations' that conspicuously sound exactly the same as the melody line. You want to play 'Bennie and the Jets' from the starting heavy chords to the verse to the jazzy piano solo, here you go. Blue Eyes, Rocket Man, Someone Saved My Life Tonight (excellent song)... it's all here. In some instances (like Honky Cat for example), there's just no point in bothering to learn the music EXACTLY, because Elton John just improvised within chords in the first place. So it's best for you to do the same unless you want to pore through pages of the same music phrased slightly differently. Next time it would be better to include the more 'precise' songs in Elton's catalogue.Anyway, this is a great collection. Some of the songs aren't very well known but get the album they're on and you're away. Hours of fun."
2,They need more stars...,We can only hope more classics as precious and timeless as this are in our future. A must see every Christmas.
2,MUSIC Makes Sense,"I haven't had a CD that I haven't skipped tracks. Even if it's the best of. Clay Aiken had come up with BEST of CLAY on HiS FIRST RELEASE. It's combination of not just pop songs but mix of danceable tunes(Invisible), Country (Perfect Day), Oldies (I Will Carry You), Rock Ripped (No More Sad Songs), Sexy (Touch), Edgy and heart twisting(I Survived You). There is a story in every tract and Artist let's you be a part of that Journey. Fans and Avid Music Listener would not be disappointed. Why are you still reading.. GO BUY ONE and HEAR for YOURSELF."
2,Disappointed with some of the reviews on Measure Of A Man!,"We have enough ""HIP-HOP"" & ""RAP"" music it's about time that we can listen to a song and understand the words and not be afraid for our children to listen!I bought Clay's CD the day it was released and was so excited.I couldn't wait to listen to it on my way home.I was very happy with the songs and Clay's outstanding smooth vocals.We need more Clay's to help shape the music industry by standing strong in his beliefs & values....Clay...don't change and thank you for helping to put a little dignity back in the world & music to soothe our souls."
2,So Sad...,"How could the powers that be not see the utter genius in this show? Leave it to Mtv to can something as great as this in favor of dreck like ""My Super Sweet Sixteen."" They should be ashamed of themselves (well, they should've been ashamed of themselves long before this, but that's besides the point).Abe Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Cleopatra, Ghandi & JFK (along with a host of others)... cloned... in high school...Very well-written... great voice casting (Will Forte, Nicole Sullivan, Michael McDonald)... a great show that didn't get a chance, thanks to a once great network that has gone down the pooper."
1,Only lasts 6 months,I bought this power adapter and it worked just fine at first. I took good care of it and after about six months it just stopped working.
2,I must add my voice,"to those who are praising this movie. It is fun, it is profound, it is whimsical, it is confrontational--everything that Hollywood movies are not. It is the kind of movie that demands repeated viewings. A MUST BUY!"
1,Not up to standards,"If you're an Asimov junkie like me, you'll buy and read this book no matter what anybody says. But if you were thrilled with the first three books in the series, ecstatic over the addition of Prelude to Foundation, and slightly less than pleased with Foundation's Edge, then you'll be disappointed with this one.I felt Isaac was preaching at me in some sort of new age galactic godspeak rather than entertaining me with a good story. Maybe that's the danger of writing so many good adventure books: eventually you want to advertise your beliefs. I don't know if that's true or not, but I do know that this book was a terrible letdown for me in an otherwise brilliant series.The ending didn't gather together the threads of the story, but only seemed to serve as a steppingstone for books that were never to be written. The Foundation Series is a grand adventure, standing up for the most part over forty years after some of the volumes were written. Well, five out of six of them do, at least."
1,Utopian fantasy,"Hogan is a member of that group of sci-fi writers who present bold ideas but don't particularly write well or develop characters (Isaac Asimov is the first, and best, member of that school of Sci-Fi writers.) His idea seems rather weak to me as ignores human (mainly male) nature. We have had thousands of years of war, sexism and the exclusion of various ""outsider"" groups (based on caste, race, tribe, income, etc.) Even studies of chimpanzees, humans closest relatives, have shown certain ""outsider"" males are physically abused by the ""alpha males"" of the group. Look at the primary source texts and warlike art of civilizations from the Aztec to the Sumerians and you will see intolerance is a problem of the y-chromosome, not social conditioning from one particular society. Matriarchy might be the only real answer to the world's problems."
2,World Encyclopedia of Bread,"Excellent book for beginners. A must for anyone who wants to fresh taste of home made bread. Excellent photographs and guidelines. Included also is method for adapting recipes for bread machines. As the name says it recipes from all over the world like England, Mediterranean and Asia are discussed, not to mention the American and festive type breads. I love it & sure that you will too"
1,"Outdated, Innacurate, Self-agrandizing: Watch the Movie","I realize that this is the first book a person will come to when searching on MANSON. However, you should really just skip it and watch the Made-for-TV movie which cut out all of Bugliosi's egotisical grandstanding and actually did a much better job of revealing what it was like to be in that circus of a court-room. The film also accurately depicts how much Bugliosi relied on the statements of tripped out Family members who did not participate in the killings in order to construct his ""Helter Skelter"" theory of the Crime. Do yourself a favor and buy CHARLIE'S FAMILY by Jim Vanbebber available here at Amazon.com in addition to this book. The two will show you the opposite ends of the theoretical spectrum on the Manson case."
1,These chip,"The price is right and these mugs have a great shape for easy handling. I wish I could say buy these, But...the rims chip very easily. Someone else stated this in their review should of followed their advice."
2,Better Than Expected,"I bought my Mr. Coffee mug warmer locally at a store. I wasn't expecting much out of it because of the reviews about it here on Amazon, but hey it was really cheap, under ten bucks. I was pleasantly surprised at how it kept my cup of tea consistently very warm throughout the day while I'm at work. This is how hot the heating plate can get: put a drop or two of water on it, and the drops will sizzle and evaporate quickly. The key to getting the best experience out of using the Mr. Coffee mug warmer is to use with a cup of HOT tea/coffee/soup/whatever. It won't make your cold beverage hot again (use a microwave for that)."
1,I can't belive LJS wrote this,"I am a huge LJS fan, I have read almost all of her books well over 10 times except this one. It was so boring I really disliked to book. It didn't have anything to do with the NW until the book was almost done, and Gillian was so pathetic and whimpy. David.... I really didn't like his character at all."
2,great carrier for distances,"We just finished with a trip to visit family and it worked great. Around 500 miles each way.It took about an hour to get it adjusted so I could get all 4 bikes on at once. After that, everything was set and I loaded 4 bikes in 10-15 minutes. I'm sure I'll get even better.The only improvement they could make would be to have two posts with more space. The middle 2 bikes fit really tight so you have to put them in just right. It was harder because my son has a BMX style bike and our daughter has a similar bike with 16"" (I believe) wheels. Those fall through the mounts, but it stays in there securely anyway.My arms don't lock in the down position very easily, but I only use that for storage so I'm not worried. I'd probably buy it again, especially for the price."
1,ripped-off by seller,"American Electronics Mart sold me a ""refurbished"" Xerox documate 510 scanner that did not work from the start. I spent two weeks trying to troubleshoot to find out whether the problem was on my end. Then, because I missed the return deadline, they would not take the scanner back. They would not agree to pay the costs to me to ship the scanner back to them. Now, I have wasted $250 on a worthless piece of junk sold to me by these crooks. Don't ever buy anything from these creeps."
1,Baby dry is not as good as swaddlers,I was a new mom and therefore pretty tired. I didn't notice that there was a difference between baby dry and swaddlers and accidentally bought baby dry. They are more plastic and didn't seem to let my baby's skin breathe nearly as well as the swaddlers. I won't buy the baby dry again!
2,Daunting but Delightful,"My quirky yet brilliant English teacher assigned this work in the beginning of my senior year. Undoubtedly, I approached this book with much doubt and skepticism. If you know Hardy, you immediately recall his superfluity of detail and monotonous landscaping, which inevitably impedes character and plot development. Suprisingly, though all discouraging factors were present, I found the book exceptionally appealing. Hardy's portraiture of Tess validates him as a captivating author. He draws us into her persona, leaving us trampled and bruised with the grievances of life. He walks us through her struggles, though mangled with her inability to step forward, she still persists.I highly reccommend this book to any avid reader of British literature."
2,Dark and Bold,"1984 is written in the style of the ""negative utopia."" It is a dark vision of a future society in which personal freedom has been destroyed and in which a small group have established dictatorial control over the many. It was written mainly as a warning against authoritarianism and totalitarianism.....not just the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, but also against the totalitarianism of the mind that is currently evolving in capitalist culture as well. Orwell was a socialist. This is only relevant to counter those who say that Orwell was criticizing socialism. He most certainly was not...socialists stand for personal freedom and economic democracy.This is a very well written book with a good plot. Orwell's vision was a clear one and a danger that has not entirely been eliminated today."
1,Boring,Was surprised at how boring this book was. A lot of blah blah about things I cared nothing about. A relative of mine was Norma Baden Wallace who was known as the Last Madam and Queen of the Underworld. She wasn't mentioned.
1,"Quite possibly, the worst book I've ever read","This was assigned to me in college 25 years ago. I still remember how I struggled to get through the 90 some pages of this book. One reviewer wrote that the point wasn't to tear down men, but to show that women can live without men. She must have missed the part where because me are gone, so are wars. Clearly only men can be greedy/hateful. Women are only nurturing and giving. This book was assigned along with ""The Handmaid's Tale"" by Margaret Atwood. I can't say enough good things about THAT book."
2,It's Spiderman,"I'd seen all 3 movies prior to this purchase, however, this now enables me to view any of the 3 whenever I feel like it. My only commentary is, ""It's Spiderman"". I think that says enough. I'm well pleased with the delivery terms, condition and quality of the products."
1,an extreme emotional ride,"If you want to watch a movie where a couple meets, falls in love, gets married, almost breaks up, have cat fights, get angry, make up, has new problems, lie to each other, hurt each other again, almost break up, really do break up, cry, yell at each other, cry again, then finally make up because there's not really anything else to do - then this is the movie for you.If you do, for some reason, decide to watch this, watch it to the point where they get married -THEN TURN IT OFF (being bollywood, thats about the length of a regular movie anyway)."
